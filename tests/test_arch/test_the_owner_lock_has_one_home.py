"""Architecture test: the owner's write lock is taken where a writing transaction BEGINS, and nowhere else.

Plan step ``balance:X-bn``, rulings **credit_card:R-CC106** ("one writer per
owner: every save takes your write lock before it reads anything, in the one
module that opens each request's database transaction"), **R-CC114** (page
loads' writes take it too), **R-CC115** ("The lock is taken only where
database work starts ... The older calls go, and a test fails the build if
anything else takes the lock") and **R-CC121** (a sign-in takes it right after
finding the account).  This is that test.

Why a second home is a defect and not a harmless repeat
-------------------------------------------------------

Before the step, nineteen calls in ten modules took the lock at their own
point in a transaction: sixteen ``lock_user_writes`` calls in nine modules,
and three that plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4`` put inside
``row_write_lock``.  Each was a claim that ITS read was the one that needed
serialising, and a census over the whole suite found 27 endpoints that had
already locked a row by the time they reached one -- the order that deadlocks
against a door holding the owner's lock and waiting on that row.  Taken where
the transaction begins, the lock precedes every read of the owner's data and
every row lock by construction, so a later acquisition can only be a repeat --
and a repeat reads as load-bearing to the next author, who then "fixes" a
path by adding another at the wrong depth.

What this test enforces
-----------------------

Over every Python module under ``app/``, ``scripts/`` and ``migrations/``, and
the repository root's own (``gunicorn.conf.py``, ``run.py``):

* Each name that takes the lock, or reaches a function that does, is
  referenced only by its homes (:data:`_HOMES`): the one statement of the lock
  (``take_owner_write_lock``) by ``app/db_transaction.py`` and
  ``app/services/user_write_lock.py``; the every-owner form by the three
  deploy reconciles' modules; the lock's KEY (``_USER_WRITE_LOCK_NAMESPACE``)
  by ``user_write_lock.py`` alone, so no module can take the same lock under
  its own statement; ``bind_request_actor`` (where a request's owner becomes
  known) by the logging hook that signs the request in;
  ``bind_sign_in_owner`` by the two sign-in routes; the two private
  functions that do the locking by ``db_transaction`` itself; and the two
  ``g`` keys that arm the listener for an owner -- ``_OWNER_KEY`` and
  ``_PENDING_OWNER_KEY`` reached as ``db_transaction``'s attributes or
  imported from it, and their string values as a string or as a ``g``
  attribute -- by nothing outside ``db_transaction``.
* Every PostgreSQL advisory-lock function -- any name or attribute spelled
  ``pg_advisory...`` or ``pg_try_advisory...``, and any non-docstring string
  that names one, which is a raw SQL statement -- appears only in
  ``user_write_lock.py``.
* The name ``lock_user_writes`` -- the deleted per-service form -- is bound
  nowhere.
* **The homes cannot grow a new door.**  ``user_write_lock.py`` binds
  exactly its namespace and the two functions above at module level -- no
  lambda, class or alias -- so a helper wrapping the statement under a new
  name (the ``lock_user_writes`` shape again) fails here rather than passing
  as "inside a home".  And inside EVERY home, the functions allowed to
  reference each locking name are pinned by name
  (:data:`_PINNED_CALLERS`): ``db_transaction``'s listener and locker, the
  every-owner form alone calling the statement, and each deploy reconcile
  alone calling the every-owner form -- so a new request-path function in
  ``posting_service`` that takes every owner's lock (the deadlock that form
  exists to prevent, taken by two requests) fails too.

**What it does not see, stated rather than implied**: a lock reached through
``getattr``, or a statement assembled from pieces at run time, which nothing
catches and no honest module writes; and a reference in a decorator or a
default argument is attributed to the function it decorates.  It also cannot prove the lock is taken,
or taken FIRST, on a real request; that is :mod:`app.db_transaction`'s
construction, measured on real requests by
``tests/test_services/test_user_write_lock.py`` (the command arm takes it, a
render takes none, a ``write_transaction`` block does, a companion takes its
owner's key) and ``tests/test_routes/test_xbn_sign_in_lock.py`` (sign-in, the
refusal checks, the request's end).

Why AST, not grep
-----------------

Every one of these names appears in prose -- the docstrings that explain the
lock say where it used to be taken -- and a grep would flag the sentences that
state the rule.  Name, attribute and import nodes cannot be prose, and a
string is counted only when it is not a docstring.

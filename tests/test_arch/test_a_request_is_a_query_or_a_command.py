"""Architecture test: what KIND of transaction a request runs in.

Plan step **balance:X-i3**, finding **N-353**.  :mod:`app.db_transaction` makes
one rule structural: a GET or HEAD runs at ``REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY`` -- one
snapshot of the database for every statement it issues, and no write possible
inside it -- and every other method runs at PostgreSQL's default ``READ
COMMITTED``, writable, exactly as before.

Why the read half matters
-------------------------

Under ``READ COMMITTED`` *each statement gets its own snapshot*.  A render
assembles one screen from dozens of statements, so it could read the owner's
pay calendar in one and the rows filed against it in another, and the two could
disagree -- which is exactly what ``/grid``'s rolling top-up produces for a
concurrent render: it appends a pay period, repopulates it from every active
template, and commits mid-render.

Why the WRITE half matters at least as much
-------------------------------------------

**A command may not be given one snapshot, and this file is where that is
pinned.**  The posting-ledger reconciles are read-modify-write under an
advisory lock (:func:`app.services.user_write_lock.lock_user_writes`): take the
lock, re-read what is posted, write the difference.  The waiter's re-read is
REQUIRED to see the winner's just-committed postings, and only ``READ
COMMITTED`` shows them.  Under one snapshot the waiter re-reads its own
pre-lock picture and reconciles to a stale target -- the divergence ruling
**R-EN** measured at ``$4,000.00`` asserted against ``$1,000.00`` settled, with
the trial balance still ``$0.00`` because the anchor-equity leg mirrors the
error, so nothing fails loudly.

So "make everything REPEATABLE READ, it is strictly safer" is a plausible,
wrong change, and :func:`test_a_command_stays_read_committed` is the control
that refuses it.

Every test here is BEHAVIOURAL
------------------------------

Nothing below asserts that a particular function was called or that a module
carries a particular line.  Each asks the database what mode it is actually in,
or drives a real request and asks what that request could see.  The snapshot
test carries its own planted defect (:func:`test_the_snapshot_control_fires`),
because a test that would pass with the guarantee removed proves nothing.

"""Architecture test: what a NAMED SEEDED START STATE guarantees.

Plan step **balance:X-be-2**, finding **N-387**.  The suite could express two
start states -- empty, or "build it yourself in a fixture" -- and nothing could
say *start from a prepared world*.  So a module whose every test needed the
same world rebuilt it per test: measured on the ``url_map`` sweep, 302 ms of
setup to make 22 ms of requests, 236 times over, 93% of that file.

``@pytest.mark.seeded_start_state("name")`` says it instead.  The world is
built ONCE per xdist worker and frozen into a snapshot database; every test
that declares it still gets its own private clone of that snapshot.

**The two halves are tested apart because only one of them is new.**  That a
test starts from the world is the FEATURE.  That the test still cannot see
another test's writes is the CONTRACT the suite already had, and it is the half
a shared-database design would have traded away -- so it is graded here
directly, by two tests that each refuse to find the other's row.

**Why an ORDER-FREE isolation control.**  Both isolation arms below assert
absence and then write, rather than one writing and a later one checking: a
check-after-write pair proves nothing when the checker happens to run first,
and under xdist "first" is not a property this file controls.  Written this
way, whichever runs second is the one that fails if the copies are shared, so
the control cannot pass by scheduling luck.

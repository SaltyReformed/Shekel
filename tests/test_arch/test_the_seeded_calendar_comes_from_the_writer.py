"""The seeded owner's pay calendar is written by the doors that own it.

Plan step **pay_calendar:C4-b-1**.  ``tests/conftest.py`` used to build the
seeded owner's pay periods by hand -- ``PayPeriod(user_id=..., start_date=...,
end_date=..., period_index=...)`` in three fixtures -- and then un-build them by
hand, in a 135-line helper that deleted the opening period, renumbered every
survivor with raw SQL and re-posted the anchor corrections that delete had
disposed.

Two things were wrong with that and both are properties, not opinions.

**A hand-written period has no ``budget.pay_schedule`` row beside it.**  No
application door can produce that state: ``pay_period_write.record_paydays``
upserts the owner's cadence in the same call that records a payday (the cadence
rule, plan step C3-b), and ``auth_service.register_user`` reaches the table only
through it.  So the seeded owner was the one shape production does not have --
paydays with no recorded cadence, pay-calendar finding **P8** -- and that shape
is what plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-b`` makes unconstructible with a foreign
key.  :class:`TestEverySeededOwnerHasARecordedCadence` is the control for it,
and it is the one class here that FAILS on the tree this step replaced.

**The two columns a fixture set by hand are the two this arc deletes.**
``end_date`` and ``period_index`` are derived from the payday set
(``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_calendar.md`` section 1); a fixture
computing them is a second implementation of the derivation, and the raw
``SET period_index = period_index - 1`` the deleted helper ran was a third.

The remaining classes are REGRESSION guards rather than discriminators: they
pass on both trees, and they are here because this step changed WHO writes
these rows and the rows themselves had to be measured not to move.

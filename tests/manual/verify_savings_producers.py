"""Dump every figure the /savings producer package answers, for a HEAD-vs-post diff.

Added at plan step X-t (2026-07-28) and kept, because the three steps after it
(X-u, X-v, X-w) all change these same producers.  ``tests/manual/verify_balance_baseline.py`` reads
the ``balance_at`` seam DIRECTLY, so for a step whose whole surface is ABOVE the
seam -- the savings-dashboard package, its serializers, and the dashboard debt
track -- it is byte-identical whatever the step did.  A free pass that reads as
proof.  This dumps the layer that step actually changes:

* ``compute_dashboard_data`` in full: every per-account projection field (the
  nested loan figures included), the grid grouping + subtotals, goals, the
  emergency metrics, the archived list, the debt summary with its payoff
  outlook and DTI block, the net-worth today figures, the 2-year series with
  its composition bands, the whole Horizon range with its milestones, and the
  sparklines;
* the NARROW producers (debt summary, goal progress, and the per-account
  cockpit balance cell for every account) plus the principal-paid fraction,
  which was a narrow producer of its own until plan step X-u;
* the ROUTE's serialized ``data-chart`` payload (the float boundary);
* ``dashboard_pulse_service.compute_tracks_section`` -- the debt track that
  carries the summary.

**NORMALIZED across the intended shape changes**, so a deliberate diff cannot
hide an accidental one.  **A NORMALIZATION SHIM IS DELETED BY THE STEP AFTER THE
ONE THAT NEEDED IT**, because each adds a branch that can never be taken on the
current tree, and a file whose readers all tolerate several dead shapes is one
that can no longer answer this harness's own question (Section 7.2 -- can it SEE
the code under test?).

**Plan step X-w5 paid the two that were owed.**  The X-t1 shim (the per-account
projection's pre-value-object ``loan_figures`` / ``loan_params`` keys) was due to
go when X-v shipped and did not; the X-u shim (the deleted
``compute_debt_principal_progress`` producer and the ``DebtTrack`` wrapper) was
due here.  Both are gone, and each was verified dead by RUNNING this file
against the tree it was written for.

**What remains is X-w's OWN tolerance, and X-x deletes it**: :func:`_get` reads
a field off a dict OR a value object, and :func:`_today_figures` and the
archived row read both spellings of a renamed figure.  Plan steps X-w and X-aa
turned SEVEN containers on this path into frozen value objects (rulings R-CG /
R-CH / R-CI / R-CO),
so those branches are what let this ONE file produce the same blob on the
pre-X-w tree and the post-X-w one -- which is the only thing that makes the
diff mean anything.

**Usage** (from the repository root)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_savings_producers.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_savings_producers.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

Run it against BOTH databases (``shekel`` is the dev runtime clone,
``shekel_f3_final`` the prod-shape one), before AND after, and use
``git worktree`` for the HEAD side -- never ``git checkout``, which reverts the
working tree and discards the change under test.

It answers "did anything move", never "is the answer right": two figures
identical here can both be wrong (finding N-69).  A step's PROOF is its firing
controls and its hand-computed oracles; this is the REGRESSION check beside
them, and it was shown FIRING on a planted one-cent defect in
``_project_one_account`` (56 diff lines, reaching the projections, the chart
payload, the net worth and the debt summary) before plan step X-t trusted it.

Like its ``verify_*`` siblings here it is deliberately outside pytest's
collection (``pytest.ini`` sets ``python_files = test_*.py``): it needs a
populated database chosen by the operator, not the seeded test template.

    **Added at plan step X-w6 (ruling R-CM), and the reason is the finding.**
    Plan step X-w folded the dense map onto the projection, which means the
    three NARROW producers now carry one their consumers do not read -- and this
    file dumped every projection field EXCEPT this one, while
    ``verify_balance_baseline.py`` never runs this package at all.  So a defect
    confined to ``AccountProjection.balances`` on a narrow-producer path was
    invisible to BOTH instruments: exactly Section 8's "a census and a gate can
    be blind the same way, and then they confirm each other".

    Dumped in full rather than as a digest.  A digest answers "did the map
    change" and this file's whole job is to answer "which figure moved"; 60
    columns per account is a few hundred lines of blob against an instrument
    that already carries the whole daily series one layer down.

    **What this does and does not reach, stated so it is not discovered later.**
    It covers every projection the FULL build produces and the one
    ``compute_account_balance_cell`` returns.  It cannot reach the maps inside
    ``compute_debt_summary`` and ``compute_goal_progress``, because those
    producers reduce projections into a summary and return no projection at
    all -- so their ``balances`` is internal by construction and a change to it
    is only observable through a figure this file already dumps.

    **On a PRE-X-w tree it falls back to the seam's own map**, and that is not a
    courtesy -- it is what keeps this one file producing the same blob on both
    trees, which is the only reason its diff means anything.  The projection had
    no such field before plan step X-w1; dumping ``null`` there would make every
    account's map read as a change and drown the comparison.  Falling back to
    :func:`app.services.balance_at.build_maps` compares the NEW projection's map
    against the SEAM's map for the same account, which is exactly ruling R-CG's
    claim -- so the cross-tree diff proves it directly instead of leaving it to
    be inferred from the figures downstream.  It goes when plan step X-x deletes
    X-w's tolerances.

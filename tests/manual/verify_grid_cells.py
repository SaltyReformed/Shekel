"""Dump what every grid cell and mobile card SAYS, for a HEAD-vs-post diff.

The regression harness for plan step **balance:X-bi-6-1** (ruling
**R-BAL87**): the grid draws a transfer as a LEG read off its parent in
``budget.transfers`` instead of as the shadow row in ``budget.transactions``
it used to load.  None of the standing harnesses can see that change:
``verify_balance_baseline`` walks the ``balance_at`` seam, which this leaf does
not touch (no fold read changed); ``verify_render_surfaces`` reads status codes
and body sizes, so it can say ``/grid`` still renders and that its body grew,
and nothing about WHICH cells it drew or what each says.  Running only those
two over this leaf would report "nothing moved" beside a byte count, which is
the free-pass shape ``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard 3 asks about.

It answers *did anything a person reads move*, never *is the answer right*.
The proof that a leg's cell is right is the suite's controls; this is the
exhaustive regression check beside them.

**It captures CONTENT and deliberately not IDENTITY.**  The change is that a
transfer's cell is keyed by ``(transfer id, account id)`` rather than by a
shadow row's id, so every wrapper id, ``data-*`` attribute and door URL of
those cells moves BY DESIGN; a harness diffing raw HTML would drown the one
question in that noise.  So for every desktop cell it records the row label,
the period column, the opener's accessible label (the item's name and the
detail string: figure, recorded-versus-estimate, status, notes), the chip's
state class, and the three markers (transfer, override, account chip) plus
the due caption; for every mobile card, the card's accessible label and its
badges; and for the Plan tab's static rows, the label and figure.  Two runs
whose JSON is byte-identical drew the same words in the same cells, whatever
the cells were called.

**Where it is blind, stated so the diff is read correctly.**  Door URLs and
``hx-vals`` are identity and are not captured -- a cell whose Mark Paid
posts to the wrong door is this file's blind spot and the route tests' job.
The far-leg rule (``credit_card:R-CC23``) is exercised only where the
database holds a transfer between two members of one cash-flow set; on the
2026-09-20 production restore there is none, so that arm is the unit
tests' alone.

**Usage** (from the repository root, against the SAME database both times)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xbi6 \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_grid_cells.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xbi6 \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_grid_cells.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

It drives the FIRST user in the database, which on a production clone is the
real owner, and renders ``/grid`` for every one of their accounts as the
balance line, at the default window, at ``?show_all=1``, and over the 26
paychecks BEFORE today (where every settled leg sits).

"""Census every ``Transaction(...)`` construction under ``tests/`` by what it links.

Plan step **balance:X-bi-7c**'s instrument.  The step moved every LINK-LESS
hand-built row onto the suite's one-off builder (``tests._test_helpers.
one_off_row_of``, on ``one_off.place_one_off``) so the cutover's CHECK
(``ck_transactions_one_pricing_link`` at ``= 1``, plan step ``X-bi-7d-2``)
binds on rows the app's own door wrote -- and *which* constructions name no
link is,
as the step's own row says, **an AST walk's answer and never a total stated in
a document**.  ``docs/plans/steps.md`` carries the grep census the plan gate
re-runs (code lines matching ``\\bTransaction\\(``); this walk is the partition
of those calls the grep cannot make.

Four classes, over every ``ast.Call`` whose callee is the model
``Transaction`` (imported from ``app.models.transaction``, or attribute-called):

* ``LINKED`` -- names ``template_id``, ``transfer_id`` or
  ``credit_payback_for_id`` with a value other than the literal ``None``.
  The engine's rows, transfer shadows and CC paybacks; not this step's.
* ``LINKLESS`` -- names none of the three, or names them as ``None``.  7c's
  population, each moved onto ``one_off_row_of``; the cases whose SUBJECT
  was the legacy shape itself (the accessors' own-cell arm, the frozen flag
  cells) sat on its one transitional home ``legacy_link_less_row_of`` until
  the cutover (7d-2) deleted the builder and retired them.  What is left in
  this class after 7d-2 is a construction that never reaches the database
  as a bare row (an unsaved type token, a constructor-kwarg case, a NOT NULL
  probe), since the schema refuses one.
* ``SPLAT`` -- passes ``**kwargs`` (or ``*args``), so the keywords cannot be
  read here; each is opened by hand.
* ``OTHER`` -- a bare ``Transaction(`` where the name is not the model.

Run from the repository root::

    python tests/manual/census_hand_built_rows.py            # the counts
    python tests/manual/census_hand_built_rows.py --sites    # every site, tab-separated

Measured 2026-09-16 at the leaf's base (dev ``b0c6df9d``): 289 calls --
228 LINKLESS, 51 SPLAT, 10 LINKED, 0 OTHER.  The figure is a QUOTE the moment
it is read; re-run the walk.

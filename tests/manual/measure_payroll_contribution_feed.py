"""Report what an owner's payroll is modelled to put into each account.

Plan step **salary:R14-b** (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_salary.md``
section 4), findings **D45** and **N-532**.  The step re-points the modelled
contribution feed off its own arithmetic and onto the paycheck engine's
per-period breakdown (ruling **R-SAL2**), which **MOVES MONEY**: this is the
harness that says how much, on real data, through the app's own doors.

**It is a CROSS-TREE probe, and every line of it compiles on both sides.**  A
before/after harness that imports the code under test can only run on one of
the two trees, so this one imports none of it: it reads three PUBLIC seam
entries -- :func:`app.services.balance_at.balance_map`,
:func:`app.services.balance_at.investment_growth_since_anchor` and
:meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.reported_periods` -- whose
signatures are identical on ``origin/dev`` and on this branch.  Run it in a
worktree at the base commit, run it here, and diff the two reports.  Nothing
in it names ``AccountPayrollFeed``, ``adapt_deductions`` or
``get_current_gross_biweekly``, so neither run has to be adjusted for the
other.

**It is READ-ONLY.**  It opens one :class:`~app.services.balance_at
.BalanceContext` per owner and asks it questions; nothing is assigned to an
ORM attribute and nothing is committed.

**Point it at a THROWAWAY CLONE, never at the runtime database.**  The seam
issues no writes, but a clone is what makes the two runs comparable: the
report is a function of the owner's calendar, profiles and deductions, and a
figure measured against a database another session can move is not a
measurement.

**Usage** (from the repository root)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://shekel_user:...@127.0.0.1:5432/shekel_r14b \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/measure_payroll_contribution_feed.py \\
            --user 1 --json after.json

Then, in a worktree at the base commit, the same command with
``--json before.json``, and ``--compare before.json`` here to print the deltas.

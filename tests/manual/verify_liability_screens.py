"""Save the screens that show a liability figure, for a BYTE-for-byte HEAD diff.

Written at plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-5a`` (ruling **R-CC50**, amended by
**R-CC52**) to grade ``CC-5-5c``, the one-sign flip (ruling **R-CC47**), and the
liability doors of ``CC-5-5b`` before it: a configured loan's balance
moves from the owed sign to the held sign every other account already reports,
and every reader that shows what a liability OWES moves onto the one ``owed``
flip.  The ruling's own claim is "production's screens do not change", and this
file is what grades it.

**Why a fifth render harness.**  ``verify_render_surfaces.py`` records a status
and a BYTE COUNT per route, which is blind to exactly this change: a figure
whose sign flips from ``$176,719.77`` to ``-$176,719.77`` changes the length
by one byte and a class toggle can change it by none.  ``verify_savings_producers.py``
dumps the producers' RECORDS, and those are meant to change at CC-5-5c (a loan
projection's ``current_balance`` becomes the held figure), so its diff cannot
say whether a SCREEN moved.  This saves the rendered BODY of every surface, so
``diff -r`` names the exact line that moved.

**What it renders**, for the first user in the database (the real owner on a
production clone).  The list is a CENSUS, not a proof of completeness: the
routes found at CC-5-5a to render a liability or loan figure, widened by that
step's adversarial review.  A screen added later is invisible until it is
listed here.

* the whole-page and fragment GETs that show a liability figure -- ``/savings``
  and its cockpit fragment, every account's cockpit balance tile, ``/dashboard``,
  ``/accounts``, ``/debt-strategy``, the Taxes tab (a mortgage's interest) and
  the Balance Sheet (the posted ledger's Liabilities section) -- and the
  account CREATE form, whose "Opening Balance" is the first door plan step
  CC-5-5b changes;
* every per-account surface ``verify_render_surfaces.py`` probes, for every
  account (a route that does not apply to an account's kind answers 404 by
  design, recorded rather than treated as a failure), plus the loan page's
  balance hero and schedule, and the four forms that PRE-FILL a balance a
  write door then records -- the loan true-up form, the cash anchor form and
  display, and the edit page's books-opening card (the reviews' finding: a
  re-signed pre-fill is a wrong assertion one click away, and no figure-only
  harness sees it; CC-5-5b must move these for a LIABILITY and leave them
  byte-identical for an asset);
* the GRID of every liability with no amortization schedule (a card, a custom
  liability), the surface the anchor editor opens from beside the held balance
  its rows are summed in -- added at plan step CC-5-5b (ruling R-CC57);
* the read-only POST calculators that price a loan's owed balance -- the payoff
  calculator in both modes and the refinance comparison for every loan, and the
  debt strategy in both orders.  None of them writes: each validates its form
  and renders a result.

**Normalized** only where a render is not a function of the data: the CSRF
token (minted per session) is replaced with a fixed placeholder.  Anything else
that differs between two runs on one tree is a defect in this instrument, and
the procedure below checks for it.

**It records WHICH TREE it rendered**, in ``tree.json`` beside the bodies: the
imported ``app`` package's path, that checkout's ``git`` HEAD, whether its
``app/`` differs from HEAD, and a SHA-256 digest of every file under that
``app/`` as it sits on disk.  The script puts its OWN checkout first on
``sys.path``, so a ``PYTHONPATH`` pointing elsewhere is ignored, and a baseline
taken by running the wrong copy renders the AFTER tree on both sides --
``diff -r`` then reads byte-identical while grading nothing.  The DIGEST is
what catches that: a path or a HEAD can differ between two copies of the same
code, and the digest cannot.

**Procedure** (the clocks matter: the pages read the display day and the debt
strategy reads the server's ``date.today()``, which is UTC, so both sides must
run on the same display day AND the same UTC day -- avoid 20:00-24:00 EDT --
against the same database)::

    # 1. Baseline on the parent commit, from a worktree (never git checkout);
    #    run the BASE worktree's own copy (copy this file in if the parent
    #    predates it):
    git worktree add /tmp/wt-base <parent-sha>
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../<clone> \\
        python /tmp/wt-base/tests/manual/verify_liability_screens.py /tmp/base
    # 2. A SECOND baseline run must be identical -- the instrument's own noise:
    ... verify_liability_screens.py /tmp/base2 && diff -r /tmp/base /tmp/base2
    # 3. The change under test, same days, same database:
    DATABASE_URL=... python tests/manual/verify_liability_screens.py /tmp/after
    diff -r -x tree.json /tmp/base /tmp/after
    # 4. Read both tree.json files: their ``app_digest`` values must DIFFER.

A development ``create_app()`` runs its idempotent startup DDL (``CREATE SCHEMA
IF NOT EXISTS``) against the database, so point it at a throwaway clone; what
"never writes" claims below is the calculator POSTs, not the app's startup.

It answers "did any screen move", never "is the figure right": two identical
screens can both be wrong.  The step's proof is its firing controls and its
hand-computed oracles; this is the regression check beside them.

"""Dump every ANCHOR-derived figure the balance seam's harness cannot see.

``verify_balance_baseline.py`` walks :mod:`app.services.balance_at` exhaustively,
and that is its limit: a figure read from a balance ASSERTION without going
through the seam is structurally invisible to it.  Finding **N-181** is what that
costs -- a backfill moved a payment-timeliness metric onto a day nothing had
observed, the seam harness reported byte-identical, and the step called itself
"no figure moves".  Every anchor-touching step since has had to hand-write a
probe for these surfaces and has left it in a session scratchpad, which means the
next step re-writes it or skips it.  This is that probe, in the repository.

**The seven surfaces, and why each is outside the seam:**

* **The grid HEADER's starting figure and its "as of" caption** -- read from the
  account's latest assertion beside the projection, not from it
  (``routes.grid._grid_view_and_anchor``).
* **The reconcile panel** -- outstanding purchases partitioned against the
  assertion's day (``reconcile_service.outstanding_set``).  Not a balance at
  all, which is exactly N-181's class.
* **The dashboard balance section and the PULSE hero** -- both resolve the
  account's assertion for their own caption and staleness test
  (``dashboard_service.compute_balance_section``,
  ``dashboard_pulse_service.compute_pulse_section``).
* **The savings dashboard, including the ARCHIVED drawer** -- an archived
  account receives no seam call at all, so its "Last Balance" line is a direct
  assertion read (``savings_dashboard_service.compute_dashboard_data``).
* **Property market value / home equity** -- the property's asserted value is
  its market value (``home_equity_service.resolve_home_equity``).
* **The retirement table's seeds** -- the balances the projection starts from
  (``retirement_dashboard_service.compute_gap_data``).

**Usage** (from the repository root), the same before/after shape as the seam
harness::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_clone_before \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_anchor_surfaces.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_clone_after \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_anchor_surfaces.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

It answers "did anything move", never "is the answer right" -- read the seam
harness's own docstring for that distinction, and always run a POSITIVE CONTROL
(move one cent on one assertion and re-diff) before trusting an empty diff.

A surface whose producer raises is recorded as its exception text rather than
crashing the run: a probe that dies on account 3 has silently stopped covering
accounts 4 through 9, and an empty diff would then mean nothing.

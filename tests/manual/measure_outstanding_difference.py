"""Re-derive every account's OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCE, and corroborate it.

The measurement plan step **balance:X-f3c-4** must take before it books
anything, and the reason it is a script rather than a number written down:
**the figure is the NET of every assertion's correction, so it moves whenever
the owner declares a balance.**  Four undated values for that one quantity were
once spread across the corpus, none contradicting the others -- they were one
number measured on four dates.  ``docs/plans/ledger.md``'s N-171 row has since
been struck rather than dated, because a figure in an INDEX cannot be made safe;
it can only be taken out.

**Run this against a restore, never against a live database**, and quote its
output with the database and the date beside it.

It prints TWO independently-derived answers per account and they must agree to
the cent:

* ``balance_at.cash_outstanding_difference`` -- the balance seam's own fold,
  the owner's latest declared balance less its stored opening equity plus every
  posting through that day;
* the persisted double-entry ledger's ``account_trueup`` net on that account's
  linked ledger account -- written by ``account_posting_service`` and read here
  by SQL that touches ``balance_at`` at no point.

**Two producers sharing no code is the whole value of this file.**  A single
producer re-read twice is one measurement with more witnesses, which is the
shape ``lessons.md`` names; the ledger leg is a genuinely separate derivation of
the same quantity, and its counter leg on ``<account> -- Opening``
(``anchor_equity``) IS finding **N-171** -- the real economic activity the
cutover moves onto the income statement.

**It also prints the OFFER GATE's inputs**, because the gate is what decides
whether the figure may be acted on at all: whether an import reconciles the
span, and whether the bank's own record corroborates the opening.  As of
2026-09-01 production holds 0 statement imports, 0 bank lines and 0 matches, so
the gate refuses on every account -- see
``docs/design/cash_difference_acceptance_audit.md`` for why the gate as
specified is refuted, and what that means for what this figure is FOR.

#: caught exactly that query; this file reproduced it, and the first run refused
#: to agree with the seam, which is what a corroboration is for.

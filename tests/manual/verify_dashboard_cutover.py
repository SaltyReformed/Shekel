"""Dump every figure the BUDGET DASHBOARD publishes, for a HEAD-vs-post diff.

The regression harness for pay-calendar plan step **C2-f2e**, which moves ``/``
and its two HTMX fragments onto the route's one read pass and off
``pay_period_service``'s two surviving readers.

It answers *did anything move*, never *is the answer right*.  The proof that
each replacement is correct is the suite's hand-computed cases and the gates
this step showed firing on the merge base; this is the exhaustive regression
check beside them.

**Why none of the existing harnesses covers this.**
``verify_period_window_cutover`` dumps ``compute_pulse_section`` and nothing
else on this page -- not the tracks tier, not the hero fragment -- and it was
written for C2-f1's next-paycheck question.  ``verify_savings_producers`` reads
the ``/savings`` package (which the tracks tier delegates to, but through a
reshaping this file is the only one that sees).  ``verify_anchor_surfaces``
reads the anchor figures on both dashboard producers, so it overlaps the hero's
``last_updated_date`` and nothing else.  ``verify_render_surfaces`` reads status
codes and body sizes, so it can tell that ``/`` still renders and nothing about
what it says.

**What it covers, and why each is here.**

* ``compute_pulse_section`` -- the whole region dict, WHOLE.  Every one of its
  eight keys changes basis at this step: the hero's period dates and the
  street's day span now come from a DERIVED period rather than the stored
  ``start_date`` / ``end_date`` span; the chart, the trough and the peak read
  the pass's ``reported_periods()`` rather than ``get_all_periods``; the
  still-due totals bucket by ``DerivedPeriod.period_id``; and the street
  marker, each bill's ``days_until_due`` and the hero's staleness flag all read
  the pass's pinned day instead of three separate ``date.today()`` calls.
* ``compute_tracks_section`` -- the position tier.  Its producers did not
  change, but the READ PASS it hands them did: it opened one of its own and now
  takes the route's, so a loan resolved for the pulse region and the same loan
  in the debt track are one resolution rather than two that agreed.
* ``compute_balance_section`` -- the anchor editor's revert fragment.  Its
  period moved from ``get_current_period`` (SQL over the stored span, with its
  own clock) to the pass's calendar, so this is the surface where a
  stored/derived disagreement would show as a moved DOLLAR figure rather than a
  moved date.

**BYTE-IDENTITY IS THE GATE HERE.**  Every replacement in this leaf is claimed
EQUAL to the query it replaces on any schedule whose stored columns match the
derivation, and ``pay_period_write`` has materialised that derivation on every
write since plan step C3-b.  A moved line is therefore either a stored/derived
disagreement on this database -- itself the finding -- or a defect.  Print
``derived_vs_stored`` below before reading the diff: it says whether this
database can express a disagreement at all.  Measured on the dev clone
2026-08-18: one owner, 62 paydays at cadence 14, **0 end mismatches and 0 index
mismatches**, so byte-identity is the honest expectation and any diff is a
defect.

**It COMPILES AND RUNS ON BOTH SIDES**, which is what
``docs/plans/lessons.md`` asks of a before/after harness and what the three
producers' changed signatures would otherwise have prevented: before this step
they took a ``user_id`` and lived in ``dashboard_pulse_service`` /
``dashboard_service``; after it they take a read pass or a resolved section and
live in the ``dashboard_service`` package.  :func:`_producers` resolves both
spellings at import, so ONE file dumps both trees.

**Usage** (from the repository root, against a production CLONE)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_dev \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_dashboard_cutover.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_dev \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_dashboard_cutover.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

For the HEAD side use ``git worktree add`` -- never ``git checkout``, which
reverts the working tree and discards the change under test
(``docs/plans/lessons.md``).

**RUN BOTH SIDES ON THE SAME CIVIL DAY.**  Every producer here places "today":
the pulse region resolves the period containing it, the street marks it, and
each bill counts days to its due date from it.  A BEFORE captured yesterday and
an AFTER captured today differ by the calendar rather than by the change.

## What it measured at C2-f2e (2026-08-18)

Against a clone of production migrated to ``dev``'s head -- one owner with 62
paydays at cadence 14 and one companion with none; **0 end mismatches and 0
index mismatches** for both, so the database cannot express a stored/derived
disagreement and byte-identity is the honest expectation.

**The dumps are BYTE-IDENTICAL**: ``diff before.json after.json`` is empty
across both owners, all three producers, and all eight keys of the pulse
region.  The owner's hero reads ``$752.62`` at the end of the period
2026-08-13 .. 2026-08-26 with the next paycheck on 2026-08-27, the revert
fragment reads the same ``$752.62``, and the tracks tier carries one goal --
before and after alike.  The companion, who has no pay periods and no
resolvable account, gets ``None`` from the pulse region and ``{"hero": None}``
from the fragment on both sides, so the degraded arm is covered rather than
merely unexercised.

**That run was BLIND on five of the eight keys, and a SECOND run over a seeded
clone is what covers them** (C2-f2e's adversarial code review, 2026-08-18).
Production carries no projected expense in the current or next period today,
so ``still_due`` was ``0.00``/``0.00``, ``due_soon`` and
``due_soon_stations`` were empty, and every one of the chart's 13 points held
the same number -- which means the two riskiest rewrites in the leaf (the
``period.id`` -> ``period.period_id`` bucketing, and the forward slice moving
from stored-ordinal order to payday order) ran over zero rows and an unordered
constant.  ``ask which axis no case varies`` is what
``docs/plans/lessons.md`` says about exactly this.

The second run seeds four projected expenses into a copy of the clone -- two
sharing a due day in the current period, one undated, one in the next -- and is
**BYTE-IDENTICAL as well**, over: ``still_due`` ``$350.00`` current against
``$1,500.00`` next (both buckets non-empty, so the ``period_id`` comparison is
exercised on each side of its branch); a ``due_soon`` list of three carrying
``day_offset`` 3 and ``days_until_due`` -2; one street station of count 2 (the
same-day grouping); a chart of 13 points holding TWO distinct balances
(``$402.62`` and ``-$1,097.38``), so the slice's order is observable; a trough
at **offset 1** rather than the identity, which is the only run in which the
extremum's ordinal arithmetic is graded at all; a peak at offset 0; and the
hero and the revert fragment agreeing at ``$402.62``.

The BEFORE side was captured from a ``git worktree`` at ``5ab457b7``, on the
same civil day, with ``PYTHONPATH=.`` (these harnesses are run from the
repository root, which the shell does not add for a script under
``tests/manual/``).

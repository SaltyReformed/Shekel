"""Dump what a loan's plan SUMS and what its posted ledger BOOKS, and what moves.

The regression harness for recurrence plan steps **R16-b-2** (doors 1-5),
**R16-c-1** (doors 6-7, its claim that merging the two folds moves nothing)
and **R16-c-2** (every door, and the POSTED money).  R16-b-2 makes the
balance seam's ESTIMATED tier sum EVERY definition paying into a loan on its
own cadence, price every occurrence no row answers (ruling **R-R64**), and
charge the CONTRACT's calendar (ruling **R-R68**).  R16-c-2 makes that
calendar the loan's ONE calendar, in the settled walk as well as the plan:
every contractual installment from origination is charged (rulings **R-R72**,
**R-R89**, **R-R100**), so a skipped month owes its interest in the POSTED
ledger too -- the next payment clears the arrears before it reaches principal.
Run it on a worktree at the base commit and on the branch, against the same
clone, and diff the two outputs from line 2.

**Every door prints the posted ledger's inputs as well as the plan**: each
settled payment's split and each anchor's correction off
:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`, and the posting TARGETS
the walk implies -- what the next deploy's ``backfill_all_loan_postings``
reconciles the ledger to -- then the plan's payments, the trajectory's
projected splits, the payoff, a balance grid, the what-if lever and the
projected interest.  It reads only producers present on both sides of
R16-c-2, so the one file runs on both trees.

**The BASELINE and the TODAY read are expected byte-identical after
recurrence:R23** (a loan with no unpaid installment after its latest
statement moves nothing), **and seven doors are PLANTED.**  Doors 1-5 were
R16-b-2's; they MUST NOT move under R16-c-2 (each changes the plan's
payments, not the calendar's reach).  **Doors 6 and 7 MUST move under
R16-c-2**, and only as ruled: the reverted installments' months are charged
in the SETTLED walk now, so the latest settled payment clears them first
(its interest grows, its principal shrinks, and its posting target moves by
the same cents), the overdue catch-ups pay pure principal, and every later
balance carries the interest accrued on the un-reduced balance.  Both of the
developer's live loan payments are stated-price, monthly on the contractual
day, and every forward slot the schedule reaches is answered by a row, so on
unmodified data an all-green diff says nothing about whether the new code
runs.  Each door constructs a state in which the tiers differ:

* **DOOR 1 -- D47, a SECOND definition into the Mortgage**: a planted
  ``$500.00`` every-paycheck sweep, the developer's Emergency Fund transfer's
  shape, created into the Mortgage with its id FORCED below the payment's
  (the reachable ordering: the sweep authored first).  The old tier priced
  every uncovered installment from the definition with the lowest id -- the
  sweep -- so the loan read ``None`` against an escrow it does not
  cover; the sum adds the sweep's 26 occurrences a year beside the payment's
  and the payoff comes IN.  Planted fresh rather than re-pointing the archived
  sweep itself, whose soft-deleted undated rows claim every saved paycheck
  and would answer its occurrences until the horizon.
* **DOOR 2 -- D46, the reset door's mid-transaction state**: the Van's rows
  in periods that have STARTED are hard-deleted (what ``reset_pay_periods``
  does before it repopulates) and the plan is read in the hole.  The old tier
  priced an occurrence dated before ``as_of`` by neither tier, so the payoff
  read one installment LATE and door-bounded generation would write one
  installment past the loan's life; the sum prices it as the row generation
  would write (ruling **R-R64**) and the payoff does not move.
* **DOOR 3 -- occurrence identity, an ad-hoc EXTRA beside an unanswered
  installment**: a ``$2,000.00`` projected transfer into the Van dated in a
  month past the saved horizon, whose installment no row answers yet.  The
  old month-slot de-dup treated the extra as that month's payment and
  DROPPED the installment; by occurrence the installment is still owed and
  both reach the plan.
* **DOOR 4 -- D53 and R-R64's cancelled clause, a future row the owner
  REMOVED**: the Van's next projected installment is soft-deleted through the
  transfer door.  The old tier could not see a tombstone and re-synthesized
  the installment; the sum reads the tombstone as the owner's answer -- the
  installment is not paid -- and the contract charges the period anyway
  (ruling **R-R71**), so the payoff moves OUT by one installment.
* **DOOR 5 -- D54, a projected extra in a SEEDED month**: a ``$300.00``
  projected transfer into the Van due five days after its most recently
  settled installment, inside that installment's month.  The old calendar
  charged that month a second time at the extra's date; the seed already
  charged it, so the sum charges it once and the extra pays pure principal.
* **DOORS 6 and 7 -- a DELINQUENT loan (plan step recurrence:R16-c-1)**: the
  settled installments before the latest settled one are REVERTED to
  projected through the status door -- one on the Van (its 2026-06-23 true-up
  leaves it one), TWO on the Mortgage behind its latest settled one.  R16-c-1
  had to walk the skipped months' charges and their catch-ups in contract
  order behind the facts (a first cut applied both charges first, which the
  two-catch-up door read as the Mortgage payoff moving a month and every
  projected balance point with it); both read 0 lines on that fix.  Under
  R16-c-2 the same two doors are where the posted money moves (above).

Nothing it prints carries an id a door's own write assigned, for the reason
``verify_generation_pass.py`` states: PostgreSQL does not roll a sequence
back, so an id-bearing dump reads as a difference between two runs of
identical code.  The posting targets name rows the clone already holds (a
pay period, a ledger account, a reference kind), which no run re-assigns.  Every door opens a nested transaction and
``Session.rollback()`` afterwards discards the whole outer transaction with
it, so the database is unchanged and no door sees another's writes.

**The clone must be STAMPED and it must be production's**: ``occurs_on`` is
what answers an occurrence, and a clone whose loan rows carry NULL there reads
every occurrence as unanswered.  Both loan payments' rows were stamped on
the production clones measured (none NULL: 2026-09-11 and 2026-09-23, and
0 of 59 on the dumps of 2026-09-24 and 2026-09-25).

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=. DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../<clone> DATABASE_URL_APP= \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_loan_plan_sum.py

``PYTHONPATH=.`` is load-bearing: a script run by path puts its OWN directory
on ``sys.path``, not the working directory.

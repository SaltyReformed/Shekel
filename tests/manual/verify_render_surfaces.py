"""GET every authenticated surface against a real database, for a HEAD diff.

**The fourth harness, and it is here because the other three are blind to the
same thing.**  ``verify_balance_baseline.py`` reads the balance seam,
``verify_savings_producers.py`` reads the producer packages above it, and
``verify_anchor_surfaces.py`` reads the anchor-derived figures either misses.
All three call PRODUCERS.  None of them renders a ROUTE, so none can see a
change that leaves every figure identical and still breaks the page -- a
template reading a key a view stopped publishing, a partial handed a value of
the wrong shape, a route whose own precondition now raises.

It answers "does every page still answer, and with a body of the same size",
never "is the figure right".  A byte count is a coarse instrument on purpose:
it is a REGRESSION check, and the figures are the other three harnesses' job.
Two identical byte counts can both be wrong.

Run it before a change and after, and diff the two JSON files::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel \\
        python tests/manual/verify_render_surfaces.py /tmp/before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel \\
        python tests/manual/verify_render_surfaces.py /tmp/after.json
    diff /tmp/before.json /tmp/after.json

A ``404`` is recorded rather than treated as a failure: most per-kind account
routes 404 for an account of another kind by design, so the DIFF is the signal
and an absolute status is not.

It drives the FIRST user in the database, which on a production clone is the
real owner; a companion role holds no accounts and would measure nothing.

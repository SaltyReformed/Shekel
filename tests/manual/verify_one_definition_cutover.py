"""Dump every figure the ONE-DEFINITION CUTOVER can move, for a before/after diff.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-7d-2`` (migration ``596408fab6f1``) mints every bare
row a rule-less definition, dates the undated on their paycheck's start,
declares each TEMPLATE-priced, drops both flag columns and re-cuts
``ck_transactions_one_pricing_link`` to ``= 1``.  Its claim about itself is
EQUALITY: a bare row OWNED its figure and the same figure is now the ONE
version of its definition's series read on the row's own due date, so every
money reader answers what it answered.  This is the instrument, in the shape
of ``verify_level_relation.py``: run BEFORE the migration on a production
restore and AFTER it, with the SAME application code (the branch's -- it
reads both schemas: the pre-cutover columns it does not map are ignored, and
a bare row is priced by rule 1 off its column), and diff the two dumps.  The
balance seam itself is ``verify_balance_baseline.py``'s dump; run that
alongside.

What it captures:

* **the bare rows** (``bare``): id, name, status, paycheck, due date,
  ``occurs_on``, the stored figure or the resolved one (``figure`` is what
  the app SAYS the row's amount is, through the one resolver, on either side
  of the cutover), the recorded settle figure and basis, both flags as the
  accessors answer them, and the link -- keyed by row id, so the after-dump's
  ``template_id`` is the one key expected to move, and ``due_date`` /
  ``occurs_on`` on exactly the rows the migration dated;
* **the grid** (``grid``), per account over EVERY saved paycheck: the row keys
  of both sections and each cell's matched row ids, exactly as the route
  builds them (``_load_grid_transactions`` -> ``build_row_keys`` ->
  ``build_matched_by_row_period``), plus the ``amounts_by_id`` map every cell
  reads its figure from;
* **the companion pages** (``companion``): per companion user and paycheck,
  the row ids ``companion_service.get_visible_transactions`` shows;
* **timeliness** (``timeliness``): ``payment_timeliness_from_txns`` over every
  settled expense, and per row the ``days_paid_before_due`` -- the ONE
  surface the cutover is ruled to move (**R-BAL22**: a Paid row that was
  undated now reads its paycheck's start), printed per row;
* **statements** (``statements``): how many SQL statements the grid's read
  path issued for the LARGEST account, beside its row and definition counts
  -- finding **BAL-511**'s measurement, which must be FLAT in the one-off
  count if the pricing pass rides the route's eager loads;
* **the three tables** (``tables``): every row of ``transactions``,
  ``transaction_templates`` and ``template_amount_versions`` by id, so the
  downgrade's claim -- schema back, no row moved -- is a diff of this key
  between the post-upgrade dump and the post-downgrade one.

Usage::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../<a restore> PYTHONPATH=. \\
        python tests/manual/verify_one_definition_cutover.py before.json
    flask db upgrade
    ... python tests/manual/verify_one_definition_cutover.py after.json
    python tests/manual/verify_one_definition_cutover.py --compare before.json after.json

``--compare`` prints the expected differences with their figures (the bare
rows' links and dates, the timeliness days) and FAILS on any other one.
``--compare-downgrade AFTER_UP.json AFTER_DOWN.json`` grades the downgrade
(**R-BAL67**): the three tables identical but for the two re-added cells at
``false``, and the pre-cutover schema back under the prior names.
Reads only.  No writes, no commit, nothing staged.

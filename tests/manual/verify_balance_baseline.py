"""Dump every balance figure the seam renders, for a HEAD-vs-post diff.

The balance arc's verification standard (plan Section 7.2,
``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``) says the baseline must not move
unless a step's design says it moves, and that oracles are **exhaustive and
never sampled** -- "a 14-day sample once scored perfect while wrong by
$178,103.41 on 22% of days".  This script is the exhaustive half: it walks
every account in a database and writes one JSON blob of every figure the
:mod:`app.services.balance_at` seam can answer about it.  Run it before a
change and after, diff the two files, and every moved cent is visible.

It answers "did anything move", never "is the answer right".  A step's PROOF is
its firing controls and its hand-computed oracles; this is the REGRESSION check
beside them.  Two figures identical here can both be wrong -- see finding N-69,
where two tests agreed over an account holding no rows.

**What it captures, per account:**

* the kind-correct scalar at today, at six fixed valuation dates, and the
  kind-correct period map (all five account kinds, so a loan regression shows up
  in a cash commit).  **The dated scalars are plan step X-g2b-0's addition and
  they exist because the other two are BLIND between them**: the map answers
  period ENDS and the today scalar answers one day, so a mid-period date-precise
  read (finding N-71) and the pre-horizon back-projection (N-74) -- the two
  regions plan step X-g2b moves furthest -- fell straight through the gap.  Two
  of the six dates are deliberately outside the seeded horizon, which is where
  a period-keyed producer and a total fold differ most;
* for every non-loan account: the whole ``GridBalanceView`` -- balance, income,
  expense, net, ruling R-K's remainder (as its pre-S1-c total AND ruling
  R-DH (f)'s two halves, see :func:`_grid_columns`), and BOTH modelled tiers
  (contribution and accrual, plan step X-g3a) -- plus the live override map the
  projection was computed with (ruling R-Q).  The two tiers are captured at
  X-g3a, which moves no figure, precisely so plan step X-g3b's cutover can be
  DIFFED rather than argued: the instrument before the measurement, the
  X-g2b-0 precedent;
* the cash-flow scalar at today and at the same six fixed valuation dates, and the day-by-day series over the entire period horizon (the
  no-sampling requirement);
* for the modelled kinds, ``investment_growth_since_anchor`` -- the seam entry
  plan step X-g changes, captured so that step's cutover can be diffed rather
  than argued.  Its sibling ``investment_seed_map`` was captured here too until
  plan step X-g2b deleted that entry (ruling R-AE).

**Usage** (from the repository root)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_f3_final \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_balance_baseline.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_f3_final \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_balance_baseline.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

For a HEAD-vs-post comparison use ``git worktree add`` for the HEAD side --
never ``git checkout``, which reverts the working tree and discards the very
change under test.

**One database is now enough, and that is a LOSS rather than a simplification.**
This said to run it against BOTH -- ``shekel`` the dev runtime clone and
``shekel_f3_final`` the prod-shape one -- because they carried DIFFERENT account
sets, and plan step X-c2c1's run found figures that existed in one and not the
other.  That is no longer true: measured 2026-08-07, both hold the identical
nine accounts and differ by one transaction row, because ``shekel`` has since
been re-cloned from production and ``shekel_f3_final`` was refreshed from it.
Running both now costs a second pass and buys almost nothing.

So a second dataset is worth REBUILDING before a step that could be
data-shape-sensitive, rather than assumed to exist: give it an account the
other lacks, or a kind the other has no instance of.  X-c2c1's find is the
argument for doing so -- a figure that exists in only one dataset is invisible
to a harness that sees one shape twice.

**Its own limitation, stated so it is not mistaken for more.**  Every figure
here is read at the seam's default ``as_of`` (the reader's today).  A step that
changes behaviour only for a pinned historical ``as_of`` moves nothing in this
output, and X-c2c1 was exactly such a step: its real-data run was byte-identical
by construction, and the firing control -- not this script -- was its proof.

This file is deliberately outside pytest's collection (``pytest.ini`` sets
``python_files = test_*.py``), like its ``verify_*`` siblings here: it needs a
populated database chosen by the operator, not the seeded test template.

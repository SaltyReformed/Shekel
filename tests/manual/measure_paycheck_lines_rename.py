"""Price every saved paycheck through the app's one producer and dump the whole breakdown.

Plan step **salary:R18-a** (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_salary.md``
section 4; ruling **R-SAL38**): the RENAME of ``salary.paycheck_deductions``
to ``salary.paycheck_lines`` claims to move no figure.  This harness is how
that claim is graded rather than quoted: run it on the tree BEFORE the rename
against a database at the prior migration head, upgrade the database, run it
on the tree AFTER, and ``diff`` the two files.  Byte-identical output over
every saved paycheck of every active profile is the whole claim; one moved
cent anywhere in a breakdown refutes it.

**It compiles on both sides** because it names nothing the rename touches:
no line model, no kind enum, no ref accessor.  It reaches the engine through
:func:`app.services.income_service.paycheck_pricing` -- the ONE producer of a
profile's projection (ledger row **N-443**), the door every page prices
through -- over :meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.saved`, so what
is compared is what the app shows and not a re-statement of it.  Every field
of every :class:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.PaycheckBreakdown` is
written: the period identity, the four earnings figures, the four withholding
lines, and each deduction line's name, amount and target account, in the
engine's own order.

**It is READ-ONLY**: nothing is assigned, nothing is committed, and the
session is rolled back on the way out.

**Usage** (from the repository root, on EACH tree)::

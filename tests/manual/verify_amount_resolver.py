"""Grade the amount resolver against every row, and prove the grading can FAIL.

Plan step **X-au-b**'s oracle, rebuilt at **X-bl-1** under ruling **R-JF**: for
EVERY row in a database -- not a sample, not the contributing ones, not the
projected ones -- :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_transaction_amount`
answers from exactly the SOURCE the row's declaration names, or the run fails
naming the rows where it does not.

**AN AGREEMENT ORACLE CANNOT SEE THIS RESOLVER, and an adversarial review proved
it by deleting the resolver.**  With the whole body replaced by
``return txn.estimated_amount`` the agreement pass reported *997 rows, 0
mismatches, OK* (2026-08-12, pre-cutover).  It has to: the app's published
answer IS this resolver (``cash_ledger.amounts_by_id`` is
``{row.id: resolve_transaction_amount(row, basis)}``), so comparing the two
compares a value with itself.  That is the harness question
``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard 3 asks -- *can it SEE the code under
test?* -- answered no, and a free pass that reads as proof is what standard 4's
firing control exists to stop.

**SO THE AGREEMENT PASS IS DELETED RATHER THAN LABELLED** (plan step X-bl-1).
It had two arms and both were identities.  The mismatch arm compared
``resolved`` against ``today``, two keys assigned the SAME expression one line
apart.  The drift arm compared ``resolved`` against the row's STORED column --
and that one is not a slip and not a consequence of the cutovers:
``ck_transactions_amount_ownership`` is the biconditional
``(amount_source_id IS NULL) = (estimated_amount IS NOT NULL)``, so a row
carrying a figure IS an OWN row, and rule 1 answers by RETURNING that figure.
**The only state that comparison could measure -- a row storing a figure while
something else prices it -- is exactly the state the CHECK forbids.**  It was
representable before plan step X-au-c1 added the pair; it has not been since.

**A REPLACEMENT WAS BUILT, AND ITS OWN NEGATIVE CONTROL REFUTED IT.**  The
obvious fix is to assert the CHECK's claim over the data instead of comparing
two producers -- a predicate that can fail where the comparison cannot.  It was
written, and then fired at it: with the constraint DROPPED on a throwaway clone
and one derived row given a figure, the run does not report a violation.  It
DIES, in :func:`~app.models.amount_ownership.AmountOwnership.from_columns`,
before a single record is built::

    ValueError: a row states its OWN figure or the relation that prices it,
    never both and never neither: got figure Decimal('42.00') beside source 1

The pair is guarded at THREE tiers -- the schema CHECK, the write seam, and the
composite type's HYDRATION -- and the third means a reader cannot observe the
violation to report it.  So the replacement predicate is unreachable and was
deleted with the comparison it was meant to replace.  What a broken database
gets is that ValueError, naming the row and both halves: louder than a count,
and one this file cannot improve on.  *Two shipped as-built records and an
earlier draft of this docstring quoted "1,028 rows, 1,028 agreeing, 0 drift" as
a measurement.  The numbers are struck, not tensed.*

**PASS 2 WAS REBUILT BECAUSE IT COULD NOT FAIL FOR THE ROWS IT EXISTED FOR**
(finding **N-445**).  It perturbed each row's OWN stored column and asserted a
DERIVED row did not move -- but its loop opened
``if txn.estimated_amount is None: continue``, and the ownership CHECK is the
biconditional ``(amount_source_id IS NULL) = (estimated_amount IS NOT NULL)``,
which makes that column NULL on every derived row.  So the nudge skipped 100% of
them BY CONSTRUCTION and the second resolve re-priced an unperturbed row: an
unchanged answer from an unchanged input, counted as a pass.  The giveaway is
that the two counts were the SAME NUMBER -- *934 derived rows held* against *934
rows storing no figure at all*.  Two shipped as-built records quote that count;
both are structurally true and neither is evidence.

**The seven perturbations.**  A derived row has no figure of its own to nudge, so
the control moves the SOURCE the row is declared to and asserts the row follows
it -- and asserts, in the same breath, that every row declared to a DIFFERENT
source does not move.

=========================== ============================================ ======================

**EVERY PERTURBATION IS INSTANCE-DISTINCT, and an adversarial review is why.**
A first draft moved every instance of a source KIND by the SAME amount, which
grades WHICH KIND of source a row reads and never WHICH INSTANCE.  Three
mutations passed that draft and exited 0: rule 3 pricing every row from ONE
fixed template's series, rule 5 answering ONE fixed transfer, and rule 2
resolving ONE fixed pay period -- because that instance was nudged too, so each
row moved by exactly the expected amount.  Every one is *priced from the wrong
definition*, the money-moving class this arc exists to prevent.  For five arms
the fix is the SCALE: it is the SOURCE ROW's own id, and the expected magnitude
is read off a stored column already in the pass-1 record.

**Rule 2 has no such scale, and ``salary_raise`` is what gives it one.**  A
salary profile prices EVERY paycheck, so a per-instance magnitude has nothing to
key on and ``salary_deduction`` moves all of them by the same figure -- under
which a rule 2 resolving one FIXED pay period still passed, and a SECOND
adversarial review caught exactly that after the first five arms were built.  A
RAISE is instance-distinct in the only dimension rule 2 has: it lands at a
``(year, month)`` and applies from it, so it splits the rows on their own pay
period and no single fixed period can answer both sides.  The landing month is
the MEDIAN salary row's, computed from the population rather than hardcoded, so
both halves are non-empty on any database with more than one paycheck.

**The own-column perturbation is the one that used to skip, and it no longer
can.**  An OWN row is re-priced through the sanctioned act
(``amount_ownership.state_own_amount``); a DERIVED row is given a rival figure
through ``tests._test_helpers.write_past_the_amount_seam``, the only supported
way to construct the state the mapping refuses -- ``amount_ownership`` is ONE
attribute over a type with no member for *a figure beside a declaration*, so
``state_own_amount`` on a derived row would RELEASE its declaration and the
control would grade an OWN row while claiming to grade a derived one (plan step
X-au-k).  **The write is verified to have landed on every row**, because that
half is graded only NEGATIVELY: a helper that stopped reaching the column would
report all 934 as held and exit 0, which is N-445's outcome through a new door.

**The own-column arm's weight is in its HOLDING half, and that is worth
stating.**  Rule 1's answer IS the column, so asserting that 94 OWN rows follow
a figure just written into it verifies little beyond the read; what the arm is
FOR is the 934 derived rows that must not move, which is the population N-445
skipped entirely.  The rival is scaled and signed per row so the moving half
still catches a rule 1 reading some OTHER row's column, but the number to weigh
is the 934.

**Two properties the run ASSERTS rather than argues.**  After each rollback
every row is re-resolved and must equal its pass-1 answer
(:func:`_assert_restored`) -- because a leak in the derived direction would hand
the ``m7`` mutation below a free pass, ``own_column`` running first and writing
exactly the figure a column-reading rule 3 would then answer.  And every scored
row must be DECLARED a mover by some perturbation except a DERIVE-mode loan
payment (:func:`_assert_every_row_is_reachable`), so a row graded in the holding
direction alone -- N-445's shape -- cannot hide.  ``db.session.dirty`` is
deliberately not used: this project has measured that it cannot tell a rollback
from a flush.

**A perturbation whose DECLARED-mover set is EMPTY grades nothing in the moving
direction, and the report says so in those words** -- read off the expectation,
never off what the resolver did, since inferring it from ``moved == 0`` would
confuse *no row is priced by this source* with *the resolver moved nothing*,
which is N-445 one layer up.  On the 2026-09-09 clone ``transfer_series`` is
such an arm (every one of the 175 transfers still owns its amount; plan step
**X-au-f** is what changes that) and so is the LOAN_PAYMENT rule
(``budget.loan_payment_settings`` is empty).  They are graded by the seeded
fixtures in ``tests/test_services/test_amount_source.py`` and by nothing here.

**WHICH ROWS MUST MOVE IS READ OFF THE DECLARATION AND STORED COLUMNS.**  The
expectation is built in pass 1 from ``amount_source_id``, the parent transfer's
own ``amount_source_id``, the loan payment MODE
(``recurring_transfer_query.loan_payment_config``), ``template_id``,
``transfer_id`` and the version dates -- no amount, and no call into the
resolver.

**IT DOES SHARE THE CLASSIFIER WITH THE RESOLVER, AND THAT IS A BLIND SPOT
rather than a clean separation.**  A first draft claimed the two sides "do not
share a producer" and that is FALSE:
:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.amount_rule` is called by the expectation here
AND by the resolver to dispatch, so a broken CLASSIFIER moves both sides
together.  Traced, the four misclassifications split three to one:

* SALARY read as TEMPLATE refuses (``owns_its_amount`` is False on a salary
  template), TEMPLATE read as SALARY refuses (``salary_net_for`` answers
  nothing), and a DERIVE-mode loan payment read as a plain shadow refuses
  (``resolve_transfer_amount`` will not price a derive-mode template) -- all
  three surface in pass 1's refusal arm, which is a different control than this
  one;
* **a MANUAL loan payment read as a plain shadow is SILENT**: the resolver
  answers the parent's figure where the truth is the parent plus the standing
  extra, and the expectation adopts the same wrong classification, so both agree
  and the row scores as having followed ``parent_figure`` exactly.  That is a
  real money shape -- an adversarial review has already caught this resolver
  dropping ``$150.00`` of standing extra -- and it is DORMANT here only because
  ``budget.loan_payment_settings`` is empty.  ``test_amount_source`` grades it.

**What pass 2 still cannot see, stated rather than left to be rediscovered.**

* the price series was MINED OUT of the column it is graded against, so a
  TEMPLATE agreement re-attests X-au-a's backfill.  Migration ``a9d3c15e7f42``
  run-length-encodes ``estimated_amount`` over ``(template, amount)`` and stamps
  each run at its first ``due_date``; the perturbations are what make the
  comparison say something the backfill did not already guarantee;
* the series' TIME dimension is observable on the few rows pricing from a
  SUPERSEDED version -- **7 of the 525 TEMPLATE rows** on this clone -- and
  ``newest_transaction_version`` is the arm that grades them.  Before that arm
  existed, *"answer the newest version, ignore supersession"* passed every
  perturbation;
* the LOAN_PAYMENT rule prices **0 rows** here, so it is graded by
  ``test_amount_source`` and by nothing in this file;
* ``budget.transfers.amount`` -- the second column ruling R-FI's CHECK covers --
  is reached only THROUGH a shadow.  A transfer carrying no shadows (Transfer
  Invariant 2 broken) is never priced or graded here at all.

**Measured 2026-09-09** on a clone of production at ``a1c7e5d20f43``: 1,028
rows and 0 refusals.  The rule census was 525
TEMPLATE, 350 TRANSFER, 94 OWN, 59 SALARY, 0 LOAN_PAYMENT, and 934 of those
1,028 store no figure at all; 7 of the 525 TEMPLATE rows price from a version a
later one supersedes.  Pass 2:
``own_column`` moved 94 and held 934 against a rival VERIFIED to have landed;
``transaction_series`` moved 525 and held 503; ``newest_transaction_version``
moved 518 and held 510, the 7 superseded rows among them; ``transfer_series``
declared 0 and said so; ``parent_figure`` moved 350 and held 678;
``salary_deduction`` moved all 59 by exactly ``-$1,000.00`` and held 969;
``salary_raise`` raised the 30 paychecks funded at or after its landing month
and held the other 998.

**THE NEGATIVE CONTROL, SHOWN TO FIRE** (``docs/plans/verification.md``
standard 4; measured 2026-09-09 on the same clone, on the tree as committed).
Eight mutations of ``cash_ledger._amount_source``, each applied to disk and
printed before the run so a mutation that never landed cannot read as a green
control:

========================== ============================================== =========================
mutation                   what it does                                   what fires
========================== ============================================== =========================
``m7_column_fallback``     rule 3 prefers the row's stored column          ``own_column``, 525
``m2_scalar_not_series``   rule 3 reads ``template.default_amount``        both template arms
``m1_fixed_template``      rule 3 prices EVERY row from ONE template       both template arms, 518
``m3_newest_version``      rule 3 ignores supersession                     ``newest_...``, 7
``m4_constant_shadow``     rule 5 returns a constant                       ``parent_figure``, 350
``m5_fixed_transfer``      rule 5 prices EVERY shadow from ONE parent      ``parent_figure``, 348
``m9_constant_salary``     rule 2 returns a constant paycheck              both salary arms
``m6_fixed_period``        rule 2 prices EVERY paycheck from ONE period    ``salary_raise``, 30
========================== ============================================== =========================

All eight exit **1** and all eight report *refusals: 0*, so pass 1 sees none of
them.  Three of them -- ``m1``, ``m5`` and ``m6`` -- are the wrong-INSTANCE
class, and **each passed an earlier draft of this very file**; ``m6`` fires on
``salary_raise`` and on NOTHING else, which is that arm's whole reason for
existing.  ``m7`` is the defect N-445 named, which the pass this step replaced
scored *934 rows held, OK*.

**No arm is unfalsifiable, and a first draft of this paragraph said one was.**
It claimed "no mutation can make ``transfer_series`` fail here", conflating *it
declares no MOVERS* with *it cannot fail*.  That arm grades all 1,028 rows in
the HOLDING direction: a rule 5 reading its parent's definition series instead
of the parent's own figure moves 350 shadows where the expectation says hold,
and fails there.  What is true is narrower -- ``transfer_series`` has no MOVING
population until plan step **X-au-f** gives it one, so the arm this control
cannot yet exercise in that direction is precisely the arm that will grade the
cutover it unblocks.

**Usage** (from the repository root)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xaub \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_amount_resolver.py out.json

Exit status is 1 when any row refuses or fails a perturbation, so it is usable
as a gate.  It opens a transaction and ROLLS IT BACK after pass 1 and after each
of the seven perturbations; it writes nothing, and it never flushes a
perturbation.  The JSON blob holds one record per row for a before/after
``diff``; use ``git worktree`` for the HEAD side, never ``git checkout``.  *The
record gained a ``perturbed`` map at X-bl-1 and kept ``nudged`` as the
own-column answer under its old name, so a diff against a pre-X-bl-1 run still
lines that column up.*

Like its ``verify_*`` siblings it is deliberately outside pytest's collection
(``pytest.ini`` sets ``python_files = test_*.py``): it needs a populated
database chosen by the operator, not the seeded test template.

# returning the rows.  An adversarial review read the library and refuted it:
# the hazard is real for a row nothing has modified and cannot occur for one
# every ``apply`` here has just written to.*
#
# **EVERY PERTURBATION IS INSTANCE-DISTINCT, and an adversarial review is why.**
# The first draft moved every instance of a source KIND by the SAME ``_NUDGE``,
# which grades WHICH KIND of source a row reads and never WHICH INSTANCE of it.
# Three mutations passed the whole file and exited 0 under that draft: rule 3
# pricing every row from ONE fixed template's series, rule 5 answering ONE fixed
# transfer, and rule 2 resolving ONE fixed pay period -- because that instance
# was nudged too, so the row moved by exactly the expected amount.  Each is
# *every recurring row priced from the wrong definition*, which is the
# money-moving class this arc exists to prevent.  The scale is now the SOURCE
# ROW's own id, so two instances can never move a row by the same amount, and
# the expected magnitude is read off a stored column already in the pass-1
# record (``template_id``, ``transfer_id``, ``parent_template_id``).
#
# Nothing here flushes.  ``main`` wraps each apply and re-resolution in
# ``no_autoflush`` (the series and parent lookups issue SELECTs, and an
# autoflush would push the perturbation at the database) and rolls the session
# back afterwards, which is what guarantees a perturbation never reaches the
# disk even on an exception.

    * **per row rather than one absolute figure**, because an absolute one
      COLLIDES.  A first draft wrote ``$1000.00`` into every derived row's
      column; the production clone states exactly that price on one template

      held -- a row graded by coincidence rather than by construction, which is
      finding N-445's own shape reappearing inside its fix;
    * **scaled by the row id**, because a rival that is merely *the answer plus
      a constant* collides between two rows sharing an answer.  An adversarial
      review counted 23 OWN rows in that shape on the clone -- six of them at
      ``$100.00`` -- and a rule 1 answering some OTHER row's column could sit on

      one-sided wrong rule.  With every rival ABOVE the truth, a rule answering
      ``min(own column, source)`` holds on every row and scores as correct.

    ``+1000 x template id``, so the coincidence needs two unrelated ids to

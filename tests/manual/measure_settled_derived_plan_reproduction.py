"""Does the live derivation REPRODUCE the plan the amount-source cutovers deleted?

The evidence behind the ``/analytics/spending`` fix of 2026-09-05.  The cutovers
(``d7b2e6c1a483`` salary, ``c8f3a5d2e714`` template, ``c9a4e7b21d58`` transfer
shadow) declare a row's plan DERIVED and empty ``estimated_amount``.  The
spending report's surprises list wants a SETTLED row's plan, so the question
that decides whether routing it to ``resolve_transaction_amount`` is faithful or
merely quiet is: for the settled rows those cutovers emptied, does the resolver
answer what the column used to hold?

**The pre-cutover figure comes from ``system.audit_log``, and that is exact
rather than reconstructed.**  ``budget.transactions`` is an audited table and the
trigger is per-ROW on UPDATE, so each cutover's raw ``op.execute`` wrote an audit
row whose ``old_data->>'estimated_amount'`` IS the figure it deleted.  The
declared set is identified by ``changed_fields`` being exactly
``{amount_source_id,estimated_amount}`` -- the pair only a cutover writes.

**IT PARTITIONS BY RULE AND BY TYPE, AND THE PARTITION IS THE POINT.**  A first
pass of this measurement reported "109 of 109 settled EXPENSE rows reproduce"
and that headline was WRONG twice over: 109 was the count over EVERY settled
declared row, income included, and stating it as an expense denominator inflated
the population the spending report actually reads by every income row that
happened to agree.  An adversarial review caught it by reconciling against the
three cutovers' own censuses (350 + 59 + 525 = 934 declared) and showing the
expense subset could not exceed 97.  A denominator that mixes populations reads
as MORE thorough, which is why the per-rule and per-type counts are printed
rather than summarised -- the sibling ``verify_amount_resolver.py`` records the
same trap in its stronger form, where an agreement oracle over rows whose answer
IS the stored column cannot fail at all.

Usage::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... PYTHONPATH=. python \\
        tests/manual/measure_settled_derived_plan_reproduction.py

Prints one line per (rule, type) cell plus every row that does not reproduce.

"""Drive the /retirement rail's refused what-if in a real browser (S3-f-4).

Plan step salary:S3-f-4 (rulings **R-SAL33**, **R-SAL34**) made the readiness
what-if GET answer a refused input with the assumptions RAIL at 422 -- the
Save's own body, RETARGETED at ``#assumptions-region`` by htmx's
``HX-Retarget`` header because the request targets the readiness CARD -- and
made ``retirement_controls.js`` retire a row's refusal the moment one of its
what-if controls is edited.  pytest can see neither: the suite asserts the
headers and the body, and only a browser says where htmx PUT the body, that
the card kept its picture, that the page did not reload (the post-save
reload listens on the same region), that a keystroke cleared the message,
and that a corrected year then redrew the card.

**It writes nothing.**  No Save is pressed; the rail's stored end years are
read before and after and must match.  Run it against a clone all the same.

Preconditions:
  * the containerized dev app is up and answering on ``DEV_BASE_URL``
    (``docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`` from THIS checkout);
  * ``tests/manual/.dev_session_state.json`` exists and is unexpired
    (``python tests/manual/save_dev_session.py``);
  * the signed-in owner has at least one recurring raise on an active salary
    profile (the rail renders a row for it), else the script exits 2.

Usage:
    VERIFY_DEV_DATABASE=<the app's database> python tests/manual/verify_retirement_rail_refusal.py

Exit code 0 when every check passes, 1 on a failure, 2 when the preconditions
are not met.  Paced to the dev app's real Redis limiter (30/minute per IP):
every field change fires one readiness GET after the 500 ms debounce.

"""Score the app's rendered cash balance against the BANK's own daily closing.

The instrument behind ruling **balance:R-GW** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``
Section 4), and it exists as a committed script rather than as a number in a
planning document because ``conventions.md`` rule 6 says a measurement is named
by its COMMAND: a figure copied into prose goes stale invisibly, and the four
places that ruling's evidence appears would each have gone stale separately.
**Cited with its ARC** because `bank_import:R-GW` was minted the same day on
another branch: a bare id here names two rulings.

**What it answers.**  Three arms, over the days an account's records and a
bank export both cover:

* **the cash fold** -- :func:`app.services.balance_at.cash_balance_at`, in
  which every balance ASSERTION resets the running total (ruling R-S);
* **the RENDERED figure** -- :func:`app.services.balance_at.balance_at`, the
  seam's own scalar, which is the cash fold PLUS the modelled CONTRIBUTION and
  ACCRUAL tiers an interest, investment or appreciating account carries
  (:mod:`app.services.balance_at._asset_fold`).  It is the number a screen
  shows, and on an account with no modelled tier it is the cash fold exactly;
* **the cutover** -- ``opening equity + SUM(settled sources <= day)`` with no
  reset at all, which is what plan step ``balance:X-f3c-5`` makes
  ``balance(T)``.

The first and the last fold the SAME walk, so the only difference between those
two is the reset.  The planned tier is out of all three by construction: ruling
R-G clamps a still-Projected row to ``as_of + 1``, and the reader's as-of here
is the LAST day compared.

**It reports SPLIT by whether the day carries an assertion, and that split is
the point.**  Pooled, the comparison flatters whichever arm resets: an assertion
recorded on a day forces that day's balance onto the number the owner typed, so
the gap closes to the cent whether or not the records underneath are right.
This project had already measured that trap one screen over --
:mod:`app.services.bank_agreement` scores the per-day RESIDUE rather than the
balance gap precisely because "a gap of zero over a non-zero residue is the
exact shape this report exists to stop reading as agreement", and 11 of 35 real
disagreements on this same account read as exact agreement in the gap (finding
**N-337**).  A pooled score here would repeat that, in favour of the arm that
resets.  So the days are partitioned and both halves are printed.

**Why it does not simply score `bank_agreement`'s residue instead, which would
be the obvious way to dodge the confound.**  The residue is
``the app's own rows - the bank's lines`` for a day: a MOVEMENT comparison, and
a reset changes no movement.  So it is blind to the difference between the reset
arms by construction, and scoring both would return the same number for reasons
that have nothing to do with which is right -- a tautology wearing the shape of
evidence.  The confound is answered by PARTITIONING the level comparison, not by
swapping it for a metric that cannot see the subject.  (That producer also
returns nothing for an account with no imported lines, and production holds 0
statement imports, 0 bank lines and 0 matches -- finding **N-368**.)  This
script reads the bank's exported daily-balance file directly, which is the only
outside record that exists for the span today.

**Usage** (from the repository root, against a production-shaped clone -- never
the dev runtime database, which other sessions move)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xf3c \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py \\
        --account 1 --bank ~/Downloads/checking/2026_ytd_daily_balances.csv

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xf3c \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py \\
        --account 10 --format fidelity \\
        --bank ~/Downloads/History_for_Account_Z29868989.csv

**Two export shapes, one comparison** (``--format``, plan step
**balance:X-f3c-2b-2c**).  SECU's "daily balances" export is a two-column
``date,balance`` CSV under a short preamble, listing only days that carried
activity.  Fidelity's is a transaction HISTORY whose running
``Cash Balance ($)`` column states the same fact per line.  Both reduce to
``{day: closing}`` and nothing downstream of :meth:`_Bank.read` learns which
bank it is reading.  A quiet day's closing balance is the last named day's,
carried forward, and this script does that carry rather than skipping the day
-- skipping would drop exactly the days where the reset arms differ most.

**The span begins where the account's BOOKS do**, and the bank days below that
are named and excluded rather than scored (:func:`_report_absorbed`): the fold
answers every pre-opening day with the one stored equity, so a comparison there
measures how much history the opening ABSORBED (ruling **R-HG**) rather than
whether the records are right.

    **The opening day is scored EXACTLY when it carries an assertion, and the
    reason is mechanical rather than a preference** (adversarial review,
    2026-09-01, correcting this file's first answer).  Ruling **R-HG** makes
    the day movement-free -- ``cash_ledger._books`` states the boundary as
    ``day > opened_on`` -- so with no assertion there the cutover sums no
    source, the cash fold has no step, and both answer the stored equity: the
    day cannot separate the arms, and scoring it moves a partition's worst case
    by a figure no arm chose.

    **An assertion on that day changes it, and that is the ORDINARY shape.**
    ``account_service.create_account`` writes the origination opening and the
    origination assertion for one day, so ``_cash_fold._actual_steps`` books a
    correction there and the cash fold answers ``anchor_balance`` while the
    cutover still answers the equity.  Measured 2026-09-01 on a
    production-shaped clone: **four of the developer's nine accounts** assert on
    their own opening day (the two IRAs, the 401(k) and the Property).  A first
    draft excluded the day unconditionally, on the claim that all three arms
    were algebraically forced to one value there -- true only for an account
    with no assertion on it, and false for the four where the day is most
    informative.

    it runs from :func:`_span_opens_on` through the bank file's last day, and
    both ends are already in the two arguments that carry them.

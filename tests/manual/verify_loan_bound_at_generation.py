"""Dump what a generate pass writes for a definition that pays into a LOAN.

The regression harness for recurrence plan step **R7d-c-2**, which moves
``recurrence_engine.resolve_generation_plan`` onto the composed door
(``recurring_definition.read_definition``), so generation is narrowed by the
loan's DERIVED closing bound rather than by the payoff some chokepoint last
cached into ``budget.recurrence_rules.end_date``.

**Why ``verify_generation_pass.py`` cannot answer this and this file exists
beside it.**  That harness (plan step R7d-c-1) extends the schedule by 20
periods and dumps every row three doors write.  Twenty periods is ten months,
and the developer's nearer loan pays off in 2029 -- past the horizon -- so its
closing bound is never reached and the dump is byte-identical whatever the
bound says.  A green diff there is the "measured nothing" shape: this file
extends PAST the payoff, which is the only place the bound can be observed at
all.

**Five doors, and THREE are PLANTED on purpose.**  Doors 1 and 2 are live
doors on unmodified data and are expected to be byte-identical across this
step -- the stored column and the resolver agree on the developer's own data
(re-measured 2026-09-11 on a dev clone AND read off production: rule 40 stores
``2048-12-01`` and resolves ``ClosesOn(2048-12-01)``; rule 48 stores
``2029-02-22`` and resolves ``ClosesOn(2029-02-22)``).  An all-green diff
would therefore say nothing about whether the new code runs, so DOORS 3, 4 and
5 construct the three states in which the two answers differ, and the diff
MUST move there.

* **DOOR 1 -- EXTEND past the payoff**, through
  ``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` and
  ``routes/_period_population.populate_new_periods``: both engines, the batch
  window, and the post-write pass.  Then the FIXED POINT: a fresh pass reads
  the payoff again, the maintain pass runs over the rows just written, and a
  whole-schedule generate runs a second time -- all three must report the
  same payoff and no further row.
* **DOOR 2 -- REGENERATE the pay-period tail**, the door plan ledger row
  **D46** is about: it DELETES the not-yet-started tail (rows CASCADE) and
  repopulates, so the pass that resolves the bound runs while the schedule is
  mid-rebuild.  It prints the window on both sides of the hole.
* **DOOR 3 (planted) -- the template-edit MAINTAIN pass after the loan's
  payoff has MOVED EARLIER**: a balance true-up is appended and reconciled
  into the ledger (the shape ``anchor_service.apply_loan_anchor_true_up``
  records) WITHOUT the chokepoint's column sync, so the column still says the
  old payoff while the loan folds to zero sooner.  ``transfer_recurrence.
  regenerate_for_template`` is the one pass that can RETIRE rows: on the
  base tree it honours the stale column and retires nothing; on the branch
  it follows the loan and retires every projected installment past the new
  payoff.  A first draft edited the definition's AMOUNT here, which since
  ``balance:X-au-g`` moves nothing for a loan payment priced from its terms
  -- the payoff read ``2029-02-22`` before and after, so the door measured
  a maintain pass over an unchanged bound.
* **DOOR 4 -- a SECOND definition into the same loan, carrying an owner-
  authored "Ends on" past the loan's payoff.**  Reachable through
  ``POST /transfers``: ``sync_recurring_payment_bounds`` re-bounds only the
  template ``active_recurring_transfer_template`` returns, so a second
  recurring transfer into one loan keeps whatever bound its FORM authored
  (plan ledger row **D50**).  On the base tree that authored date is the only
  bound generation applies and rows are written years past the loan's life; on
  the branch the loan's own window is ANDed with it and they stop at the
  payoff.
* **DOOR 5 -- the loan's OWN payment with its column planted STALE**, plan
  ledger row **D35**'s measured shape: ``end_date`` re-authored to
  ``2029-01-22`` against a derived payoff of ``2029-02-22``.  On the base tree
  generation stops at the column and the ``$531.94`` installment due
  ``2029-02-22`` is never written; on the branch the column is read as the
  cache it is (ruling **R-R56**) and the derived stop is the whole answer.

**Nothing it prints carries a sequence-assigned id**, for the reason
``verify_generation_pass.py`` states: PostgreSQL does not roll a sequence back,
so an id-bearing dump reads as a difference between two runs of identical code.
Rows are named by their occurrence, their due date and their amount.

Every door runs from the SAME base state: each opens a nested transaction and
``Session.rollback()`` afterwards discards the whole outer transaction with it
(SQLAlchemy 2.0 rolls back to the top, not to the savepoint), so the database
it is pointed at is unchanged and no door sees another's writes.

**DOOR 3's stale state is planted by construction, and the class it stands in
for is reachable.**  The true-up door itself (``anchor_service.
apply_loan_anchor_true_up``) always runs the column sync, so "a true-up with
the column left behind" is not a state THAT door leaves.  What is reachable is
the class: a chokepoint that moves the payoff without running the sync -- a
stated-amount edit on the payment's template, and every pay-period door --
leaves the same shape, a column behind the fold.  The true-up is simply the
cheapest way to move the payoff by a known amount.

**Re-measured 2026-09-11 on the tree the step shipped on** -- R16-b-2 merged
(``feat/r16-b-2`` at ``8c654712``), the clone ``shekel_r7dc2`` upgraded to
``6fc77e86d76f``; base = that tree with generation ROUND the door, branch =
through it.  DOORS 1 and 2 byte-identical: 101 and 78 rows, ``2048-12-01`` /
``2029-02-22`` on every reading, the fixed point at zero on both trees.  DOOR
3: base retires nothing (35 rows) against the branch's 18 (17 rows).  DOOR 4 is
where R16-b-2 changed the question: the summed plan puts the Van's payoff at
``2028-11-22`` with the ``$50.00`` sweep beside it, and on the base tree
NEITHER definition's rows follow that -- the Van's 35 run to the column's
``2029-02-22``, the sweep's 65 to ``2031-08-22``, and the maintain pass over
both retires none of them -- where on the branch the sweep writes 32 rows to
``2028-11-22`` and the Van's maintain pass RETIRES the three rows past it
(``2028-12-22``, ``2029-01-22``, ``2029-02-22``: the door's extend ran before
the sweep was planted, so the Van stood at its solo payoff's 35 rows), which
is also what writes ``2028-11-22`` into the Van's column on the branch alone,
because retiring a loan-payment row runs the chokepoint's sync.  The
``D4-MAINTAINED`` COUNT lines carry the retirement (35 -> 32); ``maintain()``
prints only what a pass creates.  The sum R16-b-2 folds reaches the ROWS only
through this step.  DOOR 5: 34 against 35.  Outputs diffed from line 2: 104
lines, every one in doors 3, 4 and 5.

**The clone must be STAMPED.**  ``occurs_on`` is filled by
``scripts/stamp_occurrences.py``, which ``entrypoint.sh`` runs after migrations
-- a clone brought up with ``flask db upgrade`` alone has it NULL on rows that
predate plan step R17, and a maintain pass then retires and recreates every
row it touches, which swamps the signal this file is looking for.

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=. DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../<clone> DATABASE_URL_APP= \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_loan_bound_at_generation.py

``PYTHONPATH=.`` is load-bearing: a script run by path puts its OWN directory
on ``sys.path``, not the working directory.

Run it on a worktree at the base commit and on the branch, against the same
clone (it rolls back), and diff the two outputs from line 2.

"""Report what the three forward-projecting surfaces say past the saved calendar.

Plan step **salary:S3-e-2** (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_salary.md``
section 4; rulings **R-SAL15**, **R-SAL18**).  The step deletes
``AccountPayrollFeed``'s hold -- the figure the feed INVENTED for a payday
past the owner's saved schedule -- and prices such a payday through the
paycheck engine on demand, which **MOVES MONEY** on every surface whose axis
runs past the horizon: ``/investment``'s growth chart, ``/savings``'s Horizon
band and ``/retirement``'s projected balances.  This is the harness that says
how much, on real data, through the app's own doors.

**It is a CROSS-TREE probe, and every line of it compiles on both sides.**  A
before/after harness that imports the code under test can only run on one of
the two trees, so this one imports none of it: it reads four PUBLIC entries
whose signatures are identical on ``origin/dev`` and on this branch --
:func:`app.services.investment_dashboard_service.compute_growth_chart_data`,
:func:`app.services.savings_dashboard_service.compute_dashboard_data`,
:func:`app.services.retirement_plan.load_retirement_inputs` /
:func:`~app.services.retirement_plan.picture_at`, and
:func:`app.services.balance_at.balance_map` as the CONTROL that must NOT
move (the balance seam reports over the saved window only, where the feed's
answer is the engine's on both trees).  Nothing in it names
``AccountPayrollFeed``, ``salary_basis``, ``build_employer_salary_basis`` or
``saved_through``, so neither run has to be adjusted for the other.

**It is READ-ONLY.**  It opens read passes and asks them questions; nothing is
assigned to an ORM attribute and nothing is committed.

**Point it at a THROWAWAY CLONE, never at the runtime database**, and ARM the
employee path first.  On the developer's own data no deduction carries a
``target_account_id``, so the employee half of the feed prices ``$0.00`` on
every payday and a before/after run over that data grades the employer half
alone; a second clone with one deduction wired onto an investment account is
what makes both halves live.  The report says which surfaces it measured and
over how many periods, so a figure that could not have moved is visible as
such rather than read as "unchanged".

**Usage** (from the repository root)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://shekel_user:...@127.0.0.1:5432/shekel_s3e2 \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/measure_payroll_feed_on_demand.py \\
            --user 1 --json after.json

Then, in a worktree at the base commit, the same command with
``--json before.json``, and ``--compare before.json`` here to print the deltas.

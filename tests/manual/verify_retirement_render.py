"""Dump every figure a /retirement and /savings render publishes, for a diff.

**The standing byte-identity instrument for those two renders**, and it grades
one leaf at a time.  It was written as ``verify_retirement_pass_cutover.py`` for
plan step C2-f2d-1 (which moved WHERE the producers get their read pass) and
generalised at C2-f2d-2 (which made the two implementations of the retirement
picture into one).  Both leaves make the same promise -- every published figure
comes back identical and a single moved cent is a defect -- so both want the
same dump, and one instrument taught two generations beats two instruments where
only one is ever taught the next thing.

**Why the other harnesses cannot grade it.**
:mod:`tests.manual.verify_reader_baseline` dumps
``savings_dashboard_service.compute_dashboard_data`` and the retirement
projection -- but the ``/retirement`` PAGE is neither of those.  It is the
readiness verdict beside the lever card, and both leaves' whole subject is what
those two share; a harness that calls neither would report "nothing moved" over
the surface that actually changed, which is ``docs/plans/verification.md``
standard 3's free-pass shape.  :mod:`tests.manual.verify_balance_baseline` walks
the seam, which neither leaf touches.

**It runs on BOTH sides of the cutover**, because a harness that compiles on
only one side proves nothing (``docs/plans/lessons.md``).  Two mechanisms carry
that: :func:`_call` reads a ``/savings`` producer's own signature and supplies
whichever of ``user_id`` / ``balance_ctx`` the tree in front of it declares, and
the ``/retirement`` block detects whether :mod:`app.services.retirement_plan`
exists and drives the tree's own entry points either way.

**What it captures, and the ONE thing it deliberately does not.**  The figures
dumped are what a render PUBLISHES: the readiness dict, the levers dict, the
per-account projections, the assumptions rail's blended return, and the what-if
panel's baseline / override / deltas.  It does NOT capture ``compute_gap_data``'s
gross-frame ``gap_analysis``, which C2-f2d-2 deletes: that record was computed at
the possibly-unset stored tax rate and read by exactly one line of ``app/`` --
``_net_frame``, for a pension figure it was handed in the first place -- so it
reached no screen, and dumping a deleted intermediate would report a structural
change as a moved figure.  Every observable it carried flows into ``readiness``
or ``projections``, both captured whole.

**RUN BOTH SIDES ON THE SAME CIVIL DAY.**  Every producer here seeds from the
process clock, so a BEFORE captured yesterday and an AFTER captured today differ
by the calendar rather than by the change.  The clock is deliberately NOT pinned:
pinning it would hide the very thing C2-f2d-1 was about, because on that HEAD
side each producer read the clock for itself and a pinned harness would paper
over the second read.  The run STAMPS the day it captured (:data:`_CAPTURED_ON`)
so a diff across midnight is visible in the first line of the file rather than
inferred from surprise.

**It also counts what a render RUNS**, which is each leaf's end state rather
than its regression gate: read passes under ``pass_counts`` (C2-f2d-1: 2 -> 0
below the route) and producer calls under ``producer_counts`` (C2-f2d-2: the
loaders and the projection walk, each expected to drop).  Those keys are
expected to MOVE, which is why they live apart from the figures -- the diff that
proves a leaf is every FIGURE identical while these fall.

**Usage** (from the repository root, against a production CLONE)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_c2f2d \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_retirement_render.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_c2f2d \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_retirement_render.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

Every figure is stringified through :func:`_money` so a ``Decimal`` diff is a
TEXT diff: ``Decimal("1.10")`` and ``Decimal("1.1")`` are equal numerically and
must not be reported as a move, while ``1.10`` -> ``1.11`` must be.

**A COVERAGE HOLE this instrument cannot close, measured 2026-08-16.**  On the
developer's data all three projecting accounts carry the SAME
``assumed_annual_return`` (10.500%), so the balance-weighted blend is that rate
whatever the weights and whatever the rounding: a planted defect that removed
the blended return's percent quantization entirely moved ZERO lines here.  The
blend's WEIGHTING, its zero-balance and zero-rate arms, and its two-decimal
round-trip are therefore ungraded by this file and are pinned by unit tests
instead (``tests/test_services/test_retirement_plan.py``).  Only one of the two
owners on the clone reaches the retirement producers at all -- the other has no
pay cadence and every figure is a recorded refusal -- so this dump grades ONE
owner's data, which is a second reason not to read a clean diff as coverage.

The instrument was shown FIRING on a defect it CAN see: narrowing
:func:`~app.services.retirement_plan.picture_at`'s memo key to the month offset
alone -- the key-narrowing class the C2-f2d-1 seed memo already paid for --
moved 452 lines and collapsed the what-if panel's delta from ``-2.7`` points /
``-$46,583.92`` to zero.

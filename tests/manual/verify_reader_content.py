"""Dump what the dashboard bills, the calendar and the Spending report SAY.

The regression harness for plan step **balance:X-bi-6-1b** (ruling
**R-BAL86**, the leaf after **R-BAL87**'s grid): the three display readers
that still drew a transfer from its SHADOW row in ``budget.transactions`` --
the dashboard's still-due totals and due-soon list, the analytics calendar's
day cells and month totals, and the Spending report's settled spend -- draw it
as a :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` read off the parent in
``budget.transfers`` instead.  None of the standing harnesses can see that
change: ``verify_balance_baseline`` walks the ``balance_at`` seam, which this
leaf does not touch; ``verify_render_surfaces`` reads status codes and body
sizes; ``verify_grid_cells`` reads the grid.  Running only those over this
leaf would report "nothing moved" for three surfaces it never read, which is
the free-pass shape ``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard 3 asks about.

It answers *did anything a person reads move*, never *is the answer right*.
The proof that a leg is priced and placed correctly is the suite's controls;
this is the exhaustive regression check beside them, at the SERVICE tier so
the diff is over the figures and labels themselves rather than over HTML.

**It captures CONTENT and deliberately not IDENTITY.**  A transfer's bill,
day entry or surprise is keyed by ``(transfer id, account id)`` after the leaf
where it carried a shadow row's id before, so the identity field of each
shape -- the bill dict's ``id``, ``DayEntry.transaction_id`` /
``DayEntry.item_key``, ``Surprise.transaction_id`` / ``Surprise.item_key`` --
is scrubbed at every depth before the JSON is written.  Every figure, label,
date, flag and count stays.  Two runs whose JSON is byte-identical showed the
same words and the same money on every one of these surfaces, whatever the
items were called.

**Where it is blind, stated so the diff is read correctly.**  The far-leg rule
(``credit_card:R-CC23``) is exercised only where the database holds a transfer
between two members of one cash-flow set; on the 2026-09-20 production restore
there is none, so that arm is the unit tests' alone.  The Spending report's
pay-period window is reachable from no route and is not run.

**Usage** (from the repository root, against the SAME database both times)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xbi6 \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_reader_content.py before.json
    # ... make the change ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xbi6 \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_reader_content.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

It drives EVERY user in the database that has an account.  For each: the
dashboard pulse once (the surface takes no account override); the calendar's
month detail for every account as the balance line over every calendar month
the owner's pay periods touch, plus the year overview per account per year;
and the Spending report for every one of those months and years.

"""Dump every row a GENERATE PASS writes, for a HEAD-vs-post diff.

The regression harness for recurrence plan step **R7d-c-1**, and it exists
because none of the NINE in ``docs/plans/verification.md`` can see this
change.  Every one of them reads a PRODUCER or a RENDER -- the balance seam,
the savings package, the anchor surfaces, 108 route status codes, the two
confirmed statements, the forward projection axis, ``/investment``,
``/retirement`` and the budget dashboard -- and generation is none of
those things: it is a WRITE, and
what it writes is the input the eight later read.  Running any of them over
this leaf would report "nothing moved" while saying nothing about the pass that
decides which rows exist at all, which is the free-pass shape standard 3 asks
about.

It answers *did anything move*, never *is the answer right*.

**Three doors, because a generate pass is reached three different ways** and
each builds its schedule differently:

* the EXTEND path, ``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` ->
  ``period_population`` -> both engines, which is where the batch window and
  the post-write calendar meet;
* the whole-schedule generate the template-create, unarchive, salary and
  template-edit routes run, re-driven over every active transaction template;
* the carry-forward PREDICTION, ``can_generate_in_period``, which is the one
  read-only consumer of the same preamble.

**It compiles and runs on BOTH sides**, which standard 3 requires: the
constructor names and the carry-forward keyword changed in this step, so every
call is dispatched on the signature actually present rather than on which tree
this is, and the side it detected is printed as the first line.  That line is
the only one expected to differ -- diff from line 2.

**Nothing it prints carries a sequence-assigned id.**  A period is named by its
PAYDAY and a carry-forward plan by its row's NAME and figures, because
PostgreSQL does not roll a sequence back: a second run against the same
database assigns different ids to identical rows, and an id-bearing dump would
read as a difference that is not one.  Measured: the id-bearing first draft
reported 28 moved lines between two runs of the SAME code.

Everything runs inside ONE transaction that is rolled back, so the database it
is pointed at is unchanged.

Usage::

    PYTHONPATH=. DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../<clone> \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_generation_pass.py

``PYTHONPATH=.`` is load-bearing and is NOT a quirk of this file: a script
run by path puts its OWN directory on ``sys.path``, not the working
directory, so ``from app import create_app`` fails from ``tests/manual/``.
Measured 2026-08-27 on this repository: the eight harnesses already in
``docs/plans/verification.md`` document the same invocation WITHOUT it and
all of them die the same way.  Reported, not fixed here (``CLAUDE.md``
rule 6).

Run it on a worktree at the base commit and on the branch, against two
IDENTICALLY fresh clones, and diff the two outputs from line 2.

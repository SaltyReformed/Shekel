"""X-f3b's oracle: what a cleared purchase becoming a cash posting MOVES.

The seventh manual harness, and it exists because the six before it cannot see
this step.  ``verify_balance_baseline.py`` samples the balance seam and would
call ruling **R-FM** byte-identical wherever an assertion happens to close over
the same day the purchase did; ``verify_statement_baseline.py`` reads the
posting ledger but grades the anchor-correction family.  What X-f3b moves is a
DAY: money the app booked when an envelope closed is booked when the bank took
it, so the difference lives in the narrow window between those two dates and a
coarser sample would report zero (the shape
``docs/plans/lessons.md`` records as a sampling baseline that cannot see a
window change).

So this samples EVERY DAY of a span, per cash account, plus every reported pay
period column, and prints the exact days that move and by how much.  It also
counts the ledger's own purchase-sourced entries, because a balance that did
not move is only half the claim: the postings must exist and the trial balance
must still close.

**Run it on BOTH sides, and the two sides differ by CHECKOUT, not by database.**
The BEFORE side must execute the OLD CODE against the OLD schema; running both
sides from this worktree reports ``byte-identical over 215 days`` and hides the
very figure the harness exists to show, which is
``lessons.md``'s "a harness must run on both sides" in its most literal form.
It imports nothing this step added, so it compiles under ``dev`` as well:

    # BEFORE -- the dev checkout, against its own clone at dev's migration head
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xf3b_base \\
        PYTHONPATH=/path/to/Shekel /path/to/.venv/bin/python \\
        tests/manual/verify_purchase_posting_baseline.py before.json

    # AFTER -- this worktree, against its own clone at this branch's head
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xf3b \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_purchase_posting_baseline.py after.json

then ``--diff before.json after.json`` to print what moved.  Each side needs its
OWN clone of the same production dump for the same reason: the two schemas differ
by one column, so a shared database would be migrated out from under whichever
reader ran first.

Read-only: it opens a session, folds, and never writes.

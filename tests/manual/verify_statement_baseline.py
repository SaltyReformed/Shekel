"""Dump every figure the two confirmed-ledger STATEMENTS render, for a diff.

The verification standard (``docs/plans/verification.md``) asks of every
harness: **can it SEE the code under test?**  Five exist because each is blind
where the next one looks, and none of them can see this one's subject.
``verify_balance_baseline`` reads the ``balance_at`` seam,
``verify_savings_producers`` and ``verify_anchor_surfaces`` read producers above
it, ``verify_projection_axis`` reads the forward axis, and
``verify_render_surfaces`` reads route status codes and body SIZES -- it cannot
see a figure at all.  The income statement and the balance sheet are read by
none of them, so a change that moves a statement line moves nothing any harness
prints.  Plan step **X-f3d** is exactly such a change: it re-points a balance
assertion's COUNTER leg, which no account balance depends on and both
statements do.

**What it captures, per user:**

* the income statement for EVERY pay period the user has, and for every
  calendar month and year the ledger actually attributes a source into --
  enumerated from the data rather than sampled, per the standard's rule 2;
* every section of each, line by line (label + amount, sorted), plus the
  section totals, net income, and -- where the running code has them -- the
  unrealized section and comprehensive income;
* the balance sheet as of the first and last attribution day, every pay
  period end, and today: sections line by line, and the whole two-part
  tie-out including its raw ledger net.

**It compiles and runs on BOTH sides of plan step X-f3d, and that is a
requirement rather than a nicety.**  A harness that a step's own change makes
uncompilable on HEAD reports every line moved and grades nothing.  So the
report fields that step ADDS are read through :func:`getattr` with a default,
and section lines are keyed by LABEL rather than by ``ledger_account_id`` --
a chart row minted by the new code has an id the old side never had, which
would diff as a moved line even where the money did not move.

**What a clean diff does and does not prove.**  Identical output means no
statement figure moved; it does not mean either figure is right.  X-f3d's own
gate is the reverse: its diff MUST show the counter legs move, and every moved
line is explained in its commit message.  The BALANCE side must stay
byte-identical, which is ``verify_balance_baseline``'s job, not this one's --
the two harnesses together are what say "the meaning moved and the money did
not".

**Usage** (from the repository root)::

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xf3d \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_statement_baseline.py before.json
    # ... deploy the change and run the anchor backfill ...
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_xf3d \\
        .venv/bin/python tests/manual/verify_statement_baseline.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

For a HEAD-vs-post comparison use ``git worktree add`` for the HEAD side --
never ``git checkout``, which reverts the working tree and discards the very
change under test.

This file is deliberately outside pytest's collection (``pytest.ini`` sets
``python_files = test_*.py``), like its ``verify_*`` siblings here: it needs a
populated database chosen by the operator, not the seeded test template.

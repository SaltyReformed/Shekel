"""Dump every loan figure on EVERY day, for a HEAD-vs-post diff.

The companion to :mod:`verify_balance_baseline`, and it exists because that one
is BLIND to a whole class of change by construction.  The baseline reads at the
seam's default ``as_of`` plus six fixed valuation dates; a change whose answer
differs only on the days BETWEEN two events -- a pay period opening and its
payment's cash leaving, an anchor's date and the next assertion -- lives in
windows of one to twelve days, and six samples miss them.  Plan step **X-an-a**
measured that: the baseline came back byte-identical over 9 accounts, 427 grid
cells and 5,978 daily points while a ``$1,910.95`` mortgage installment was
missing from the loan's amortization schedule for twelve days.

So this walks EVERY day of a span and, per day and per loan account, records what
the two producers answer:

* the balance seam (:func:`app.services.balance_at.positions`) at the read date
  AND at three horizons past it, so the FOLD (the past branch) and the PLAN (the
  forward branch) are both sampled -- the plan is fed by the resolver and would
  otherwise be measured only at today;
* the resolver-derived schedule: its length, the first forward row's date (the
  "next payment due" a page shows), the payoff date, and life-of-remaining
  interest.

**It answers "did anything move", never "is the answer right"** -- the same
contract the baseline states.  A step's PROOF is its firing controls and its
hand-computed oracles; this is the regression check beside them.  What it adds is
the AXIS: run it before a change and after, on the same database, and every day
on which any loan figure moved is named.

**Usage** (from the repository root; the HEAD side needs a worktree, never a
``git checkout``, which would revert the very change under test)::

    git worktree add /tmp/head-wt dev
    export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://.../shekel_f3_final
    REPO_ROOT=/tmp/head-wt .venv/bin/python \\
        tests/manual/verify_loan_daily_figures.py before.json
    REPO_ROOT=$PWD .venv/bin/python \\
        tests/manual/verify_loan_daily_figures.py after.json
    diff before.json after.json

``REPO_ROOT`` is read from the environment rather than derived from
``__file__`` deliberately: ONE copy of this script must be able to drive both
trees, and a ``sys.path`` built from its own location silently measures the
working tree twice (hit on the first X-an-a run, which reported a byte-identical
diff because both sides imported the same ``app``).

The span defaults to the current year and is overridable, because the interesting
window is wherever the account's own events sit -- not a fixed calendar.

Outside pytest's collection (``pytest.ini`` sets ``python_files = test_*.py``),
like its ``verify_*`` siblings: it needs a populated database chosen by the
operator, not the seeded test template.

"""The RETIRED one-payment-per-month loan composition, kept as an ORACLE.

Plan step **X-au-g-2c-3b-2**, which deleted ``loan_ledger.split_payment_cash``
from the application.  That function charged a month's interest INSIDE the
per-payment step, so it was correct exactly while a loan took one payment per
accrual period -- the assumption the step exists to remove.  Production now
charges once per accrual PERIOD, as its own event, and allocates each payment's
cash against whatever stands
(:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.replay_loan_events`).

**It is deleted from ``app/`` and kept HERE because it is not only a producer: it
is the second opinion that makes the equivalence claim measurable.**  Two suites
re-fold a plan through it deliberately --
``test_loan_payoff_date_oracle._clears_within`` and
``test_loan_interest_in_year._plan_projected_interest`` -- over plans that put
exactly ONE payment in every accrual period.  On that shape the two compositions
must agree to the cent, and *their agreeing IS the equivalence claim, measured
rather than asserted*.  Deleting the composition outright would have left the
producer grading itself, which is the "green gate measuring nothing" shape this
project has paid for repeatedly.  A plan with two payments in one period is NOT
gradeable here -- it is the case the two compositions are supposed to disagree on
-- and is pinned directly instead
(``test_loan_payoff_date_oracle.TestChargePerPeriodNotPerPayment``).

**It still calls the production PRIMITIVES, and that is deliberate too.**  The
oracle owns the COMPOSITION and nothing else: spelling
:func:`~app.utils.money.accrue_monthly_interest` inline here would re-create the
``(b*r)/12`` against ``b*(r/12)`` association plan step X-au-g-2c-3c measured
apart -- ``$565.37`` against ``$565.36`` over 500,000 randomised draws -- and the
oracle would then be grading the producer on a formula neither of them uses.  So
this is MORE independent than the pre-deletion arrangement (where the whole
composition was a production call), not less.

"""The RETIRED ``(seed, plan)`` forward-fold contract, expressed over the ONE timeline.

Plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1** (ruling **R-R90**) deleted the seam's second
replay of a loan -- ``balance_at._plan_fold._split_plan`` and the four readers
over it (``fold_forward``, ``plan_payoff_date``, ``plan_required_extra``,
``plan_interest_in_year``) -- which folded a loan's forward plan from a SEED
the settled fold had resolved.  The seam replays a loan's whole timeline from
its origination now (``balance_at._loan_stream``), and the plan's payments are
projections behind the recorded facts.

Three suites grade the forward arithmetic with plans STATED BY HAND and a seed
STATED BY HAND -- ``test_loan_plan_forward_oracle``,
``test_loan_payoff_date_oracle`` and ``test_loan_plan_assembly`` -- against
figures anyone can check.  Those figures are the grade, and they do not move:
this module keeps the retired signatures and answers them over the one
timeline, so every hand-computed assertion still fires against the SAME
producer (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.replay_loan_stream` over
:func:`~app.services.balance_at._loan_stream.merged_stream`, the production
path) with its inputs re-expressed rather than re-derived.

**How a ``(seed, plan)`` pair becomes a timeline, and why it is byte-identical.**
The seed becomes the loan's one assertion, a
:class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.LoanResetEvent` dated at the origination the
caller names (or a day before every plan date when it names none), and the
plan's payments are appended as projections through the seam's own mapping
(:func:`~app.services.balance_at._loan_stream.projection_events`).  With no
recorded payment, the projection boundary is the day after that assertion, so
every projection keeps its own date and the hypothetical extra accrues at
every charge after the assertion -- which is precisely what ``_split_plan`` did
from its seed.  ``fold_forward``'s origination gate (``0.00`` before
``owed_from``) is the empty prefix before the assertion.

**Two kinds of plan, one timeline** (plan step recurrence:R16-c-2, ruling
**R-R100**).  A production :class:`~app.services.balance_at._plan_records.LoanForwardPlan`
carries the loan's contract terms and no charge list; the seam composes it
exactly as a read pass does (:func:`~app.services.balance_at._loan_stream.merged_stream`,
charged from origination through its last event).  A :class:`HandPlan`
states its CHARGES by hand -- the ruling's promise that the hand-computed
oracles keep their hand-stated charges and figures -- and its stream is
built here with those charges and nothing else, so the replay these suites
grade is never fed by the calendar derivation that production uses.

"""The recurrence engine's frozen behaviour baseline (plan step R1).

The gate every later step of ``docs/plans/implementation_plan_recurrence_redesign.md``
is measured against.  R3 built a new occurrence engine and R4a cut the
``match_periods`` adapter over to it; this module is what proved the cutover
moved nothing it did not mean to move, and what holds R4b onward to the same
standard.

**The snapshot was re-frozen at plan step R4a** (+122 / -4 lines over exactly
the 12 shapes ruling R-R6 and plan defect D3 predicted), so it now records the
FORWARD engine.  What it recorded before is in that commit's diff; a snapshot
is a record of what shipped, not of what was replaced.

**What it captures.**  For each rule SHAPE, the exact answer the engine gives
to the only two questions it is asked in production:

* :func:`app.services.recurrence.rule_occurrences` -- which pay periods does
  this rule fire in?  (Plan step R4b-2 replaced ``match_periods`` with it; the
  capture keeps taking the PERIOD half, and dropping an unplaced occurrence
  here is what the deleted adapter did for it, so the blob is unmoved.)
* :func:`app.services.recurrence_engine.compute_due_date` -- what date does the
  generated row carry?

Both are their module's public surface (their docstrings say so) and both are
pure functions of a rule's columns plus a period list, so the baseline needs no
database rows -- only an app context, for ``ref_cache`` to resolve each cadence
axis to its integer id.

**Why the keys are ``period_index`` and a shape LABEL, never a row id.**  A
snapshot keyed on ``pay_periods.id`` or a ``ref`` table's id would churn every
time the test template was rebuilt, and a baseline that changes for reasons
unrelated to the code under test is a baseline nobody trusts.  Both keys here
are stable facts: ``period_index`` is the schedule's own ordinal, and a shape's
label is written beside the cadence it names.

**Why real model instances rather than stubs.**  ``build_shape_rule`` returns an
unsaved :class:`~app.models.recurrence_rule.RecurrenceRule` and
:func:`build_schedule` unsaved :class:`~app.models.pay_period.PayPeriod` rows,
for the reason finding B-17 records and
``tests/test_services/test_recurrence_engine.py::build_rule`` documents at
length: a hand-rolled double that mirrors the model drifts from it silently.
When ``start_date`` was added to the rule, the stub of the day kept satisfying
every assertion.  An unsaved instance costs no session and no flush, and a
column the model does not have raises ``TypeError`` here instead of passing.

It does NOT carry SQLAlchemy's ``default=`` values (those apply at INSERT), so
``interval_n`` is always passed explicitly -- the same trap that module
documents.  ``offset_periods`` was passed for the same reason until plan step
R7b-4, which made the phase a DERIVATION of the opening bound rather than a
value a caller states; no code reads that column now, so the shapes state a
``start_date`` instead and the frozen blob is unmoved (see
:func:`_add_period_space_shapes`).

**The clock.**  Every date in this module is a literal.  Nothing reads
``date.today()`` or ``display_today()``, so the blob is identical under
``TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`` and under the weekly ``SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY`` sweep
(``docs/test-suite-clocks.md``).  The schedule deliberately opens on a leap
year so February 29 clamping is inside the covered span rather than argued
about.

**Coverage, stated rather than implied** (the plan's "no silent caps" rule).
The shape set is exhaustive on every axis the matcher branches on, except that
the three calendar patterns that take BOTH a month and a day
(``QUARTERLY`` / ``SEMI_ANNUAL`` / ``ANNUAL``) sweep all twelve months against
the six days that matter -- ``1`` and ``15`` for the ordinary cases and
``28``-``31`` for every month-length clamp -- rather than all 372 combinations.
Days 2-14 and 16-27 differ from 15 in no branch of the walk: it clamps with
``min(day, monthrange(...))``, which is the identity for every day below 28.  ``MONTHLY`` sweeps all 31 days anyway,
because there the day IS the whole rule.

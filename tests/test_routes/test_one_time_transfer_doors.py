"""
Shekel Budget App -- the doors on a ONE-TIME transfer (a rule-less definition's)

Plan step ``balance:X-ci-1`` (rulings **R-BAL92** to **R-BAL94**, **R-BAL96**,
**R-BAL97**; findings **BAL-492** and **BAL-493**).  A transfer that does not
repeat is a rule-less ``TransferTemplate`` plus the one ``Transfer`` it PLACED
in the paycheck the owner chose (``routes/transfers/_instances``), the same
shape ``balance:X-bi-7b`` gave a one-off transaction -- and until this leaf
every door read the LINK as *generated*: a typed figure or a period move
flagged it ``is_override`` and made its figure its own, after which its
definition never spoke to it again (transfer 409 on the 2026-09-20 restore),
and the discardable count promised it back after a truncate that no rule would
write.  ``TransferTemplate.recurs`` / ``Transfer.recurs`` / ``Transfer.is_placed``
are the accessors every such site reads now (``PaycheckLine.recurs`` beside
them, R-BAL97), and the transaction twin of each door is pinned in
``tests/test_routes/test_one_off_row_doors.py``.

Pinned per door, each beside its recurring or ad-hoc control so the arms are
graded against each other and not against a shape the app never writes:

* BIRTH -- ``occurs_on = due_date`` on the transfer the create form places
  (R-BAL94);
* the DISCARDABLE COUNT -- a one-time transfer needs the owner's confirmation
  before a truncate takes it (BAL-492's transfer half);
* the OVERRIDE FLIP -- a period move and a typed figure flag only a
  RECURRING definition's transfer (R-BAL93; BAL-493's route writer);
* a PERIOD MOVE RE-PLACES the transfer inside the service door (R-BAL93 /
  R-BAL96): the target paycheck's start unless the owner had stated a day,
  ``occurs_on`` following; a date typed beside the move is the owner's;
* a TYPED FIGURE restates the definition's price in place and re-attaches the
  transfer (R-BAL92); the definition's next rename reaches it;
* the DUE-DATE gate's three arms -- a one-time transfer's date moves and
  never clears, a recurring one's is refused, an ad-hoc one's still clears;
  the form's input is ``required`` on the first, absent on the second;
* a day a SIBLING of the definition already answers is refused with a
  sentence (a cleared cadence's survivors);
* CARRY-FORWARD moves a one-time transfer without the flag and re-places it
  (BAL-493's third writer).

**Two shapes of rule-less transfer are graded**, and which each case uses is
deliberate: :func:`_one_time` is the app's own producer (the create form's
default selection, one transfer, one-version series), :func:`_survivors` is
a cleared cadence (several transfers of one definition, each answering the
occurrence the cadence named -- what the sibling refusal is graded on).

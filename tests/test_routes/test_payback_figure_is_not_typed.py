"""A CC payback's figure is not its own to type -- finding **N-252**.

A payback exists to repay the card spend of the row it names, so what it is
worth is a fact about THAT row.  Typing over it is a lie by one of two
mechanisms, and this suite grades both doors that used to let it happen:

* the full-edit popover, which rendered an Estimated box on a payback and took
  a figure;
* the PATCH handler behind it, which wrote one.

**The measured cost is production payback 2590**: edited to ``$123.18`` against
``$181.58`` of credit purchases on 2026-06-02 and settled at the edited figure,
so ``$58.40`` of card spend went unreported and no screen said anything.
``is_override`` cannot express the state -- ``mutations._apply_field_updates``
sets it only for a TEMPLATE-linked row, and a payback carries neither a
template nor a transfer link -- which is why a refusal is needed rather than
the flag.

"""The supported states (plan step salary:X-at-3; ruling salary:R-SAL78).

The tax law lists every state the app supports, a state with no income tax as
an explicit ``$0.00`` entry; the profile form offers only those, both profile
doors refuse any other, and the paycheck engine refuses a profile in any
other rather than pricing it.  Finding **salary:SAL-575**, re-measured on the
base tree before this step with the made-up law below: both doors saved
``ZZ`` and lower-case ``nc`` as typed, the formulas priced each at ``$0.00``
state tax against NC's ``$150.00``, a paycheck a stub priced carried the
stub's printed ``$145.00`` unmoved by a ``$100.00`` raise (NC: ``$150.00``),
and the Taxes tab priced ``$0.00`` state liability and read "ZZ · no state
income tax priced".  A profile written in such a state around the doors
now meets one page naming it and linking its edit page, wherever it is
priced (the developer, 2026-10-08, "One fix-it page").

**The made-up law** (every figure made up): one year, 2026, federal and FICA
at ``$0.00``; North Carolina at a flat 5% with no standard deduction, so the
formulas' state line on a ``$3,000.00`` paycheck is ``3,000.00 x 5% =
150.00`` exactly; and ``ZZ``, a made-up state with no income tax, the
explicit ``$0.00`` entry.  ``QQ`` is listed by no law, and ``nc`` is North
Carolina typed in lower case, which the law does not list either.

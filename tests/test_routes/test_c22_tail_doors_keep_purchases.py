"""Plan step ``pay_calendar:C22``: truncate and regenerate refuse a paycheck holding a purchase.

**Finding PC-524, re-measured first** (the step's own instruction).  It was
reproduced on dev ``c3fa6954`` (2026-09-25) in seven cases: "Remove the
tail" and "Regenerate the tail" deleted a purchase the owner had entered,
through the pay period's cascade -- UNASKED on an untouched template row,
which the discard count calls regenerable, and after Confirm & discard on
an override or a rule-less envelope, which it counts.  Plan step
``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4`` (rulings **R-CC54**, **R-CC65**), which reached dev
on 2026-09-29, closed the deletion before this step began: the lock
classifier calls a paycheck holding any payment or purchase
``HOLDS_MOVEMENT`` -- a hard lock, ahead of the discard count, so no
confirmation reaches it -- and ``fk_transaction_entries_transaction_id`` no
longer cascades.  Measured on dev ``5b6a18f1``, all seven were refused and
deleted nothing.  :class:`TestPC524AllSevenAreRefused` keeps them, through
the routes, posting what the forms emit.

**What C22 changed is the refusal's words** (ruling **R-PC116**, developer
2026-10-08, replacing ruling **R-CC66**'s period-only sentence, which
collided with **R-PC112**'s): each locked paycheck is named with every
payment and purchase it holds, its amount and its row --
"The 2026-11-16 paycheck holds 2 payments or purchases you entered (Kroger,
$87.43, in Groceries; Rent's payment, $1,200.00). Remove or move them
first." -- read through ``pay_period_locks.movements_held_in``, the named
reading of the queries the lock classified by.  Sentences are read off the
session's flashes or the exception, so no HTML escaping stands between a
test and the text.

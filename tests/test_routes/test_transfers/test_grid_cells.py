        **The control plan step balance:X-au-f-1 exists to make possible**, and
        the one that discriminates: it FAILS on the code this leaf replaces.
        Every transfer in production today owns its figure, so a test built on
        one grades nothing -- the column and the amount model return the same
        `Decimal`, and reverting the leaf leaves it green. This one declares the
        transfer DERIVED, which is the state plan step `X-au-f-3`'s migration
        creates for 169 production rows: `budget.transfers.amount` is NULL, and a
        template reading that column renders Jinja's `None` (finding **N-452**).

        **The series states TWO prices and the assertion picks the one governing
        the transfer's OWN due date**, so a fragment that resolved on the wrong
        date -- today, the pay period's start, the newest version -- fails here
        rather than agreeing by accident. `$450.00` is stated after the
        transfer's due date and `$400.00` before it, so the answer is `$400.00`.

        The money boxes are SCRAPED out of the response rather than compared
        against a hand-built payload: the box and its `amount_as_rendered`
        companion must read ONE expression, which is what ruling **R-JR**'s
        authorship comparison rests on -- a box and a companion that could
        resolve differently would report a re-price nobody made.

# ── One-Time Transfer Tests ────────────────────────────────────────────


class TestOneTimeTransfer:
    """Creating a transfer that does NOT repeat, via the template form.

    Its shape is ``recurrence_rule_id IS NULL`` -- the same one a
    non-repeating transaction template has always used -- since plan step
    R2e-3 retired the ``Once`` PATTERN that was the second spelling.  It is
    also the create form's DEFAULT selection, so this is the ordinary path,
    not an edge.  Unlike a rule-less TRANSACTION template, which generates
    nothing, this materialises exactly one Transfer in the chosen pay
    period.

    **Every case here 500'd before R2e-3** (defect **D13**): the route
    dereferenced ``rule.id`` with no null branch, on a comment claiming the
    schema made the recurrence field required.  It does not -- the field is
    ``allow_none`` -- so both the empty and the absent spelling raised
    ``AttributeError``.  ``test_absent_cadence_is_the_same_path`` covers the
    second spelling, which no form emits but a client may.

    The field is ``recurrence_unit`` since plan step R7b-2, which renamed what
    "does not repeat" is spelled as without changing what it MEANS: an empty
    unit, kept as a present ``None`` by ``_normalize_empty_inputs``.

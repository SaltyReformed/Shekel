        **Re-expressed at plan step balance:X-bi-6-1 (ruling R-BAL87).**  It
        was ``PATCH /transactions/<shadow>``, the transaction door that
        re-expressed a request on a SHADOW row as a transfer update; the grid
        draws a transfer's LEG off its parent now and the leg's popover posts
        to the TRANSFER's PATCH with ``leg_account_id``.  The claim stands: a
        figure submitted from the grid is a figure submitted for the transfer,
        both legs take it (ruling **R-IO**: the figure a human types always
        wins), and the response is the LEG's cell, not the transfers page's.

        **This case exists because the door BROKE and nothing noticed.**  Plan
        step X-au-f replaced ``update_transfer``'s ``amount`` +
        ``amount_authored`` pair with one ``AmountOwnership`` (ruling
        **R-BAL11**), and this door was not converted with the other two --
        unknown kwargs are silently ignored, so a user retyping a transfer's
        amount in the grid got a 200 and the figure they started with.  The only
        shadow-amount case in the suite was its FINALISED sibling below, which
        asserts a 400; the success path was graded by nothing, which is why a
        green suite said the door worked.  Found by an adversarial review of
        that step.

        The pair is AD-HOC so the retype is the only thing moving the figure: a
        generated transfer would resolve its definition's series and the case
        could not tell a working door from a silently ignored one.

        The leg is the from-side, where the expense twin this read sat until

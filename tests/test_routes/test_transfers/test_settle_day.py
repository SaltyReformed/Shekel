        with no day is the one that most needs a way to state the day its
        money really moved.  Keying the condition on the day instead would
        hide the boxes from precisely that row, and a neutral review found
        nothing grading the difference: ``{% if xfer.settled_on %}`` passed
        the whole suite.  ``Transfer`` has no ``settled_on`` since plan step
        ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``, so that spelling now hides the boxes on EVERY
        settled transfer and ``test_full_edit_offers_the_correction_only_on_a_settled_transfer``
        fails on it too; what only this case grades is a guard keyed on a

        settled transfer's twins and their records behind the seam (the
        legacy shape of finding **N-181**).  That state is unrepresentable
        since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``: a settled transfer holds a
        DATED record on each side or none, and the database refuses an
        un-dated one at commit (``budget.refuse_a_side_record_off_its_band``,

        The one settled-and-dayless state the database admits is a ``$0.00``
        close, which holds no record and no day (R-BAL141), so the transfer
        is settled and then closed at ``$0.00`` through the service.  The old

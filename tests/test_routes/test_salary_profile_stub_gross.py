"""
Shekel Budget App -- a salary job's "my stub's gross includes after-tax earnings".

Plan step **salary:S11-c-2b**: rulings **R-SAL102** ("A yes/no on each job",
finding SAL-592) and **R-SAL105** ("Profile card, new + edit"), driven through
the salary profile's own form:

* the new and the edit form both carry the answer as a two-option select in
  the Profile card, "no" first and chosen for a new job;
* what the CREATE form posts is stored, and what the EDIT form posts is too --
  "no" over a stored "yes" included, which is the case a checkbox could not
  carry: an unticked box posts nothing, and the update door reads an absent
  field as "leave it";
* an update that does not carry the field leaves the stored answer alone.

The values posted are the ones the rendered select offers, read off the page,
and the edit door is posted the WHOLE form as the page renders it, so a
template whose option values the schema cannot read fails here.

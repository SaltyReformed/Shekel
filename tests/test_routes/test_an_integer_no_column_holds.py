"""An integer no PostgreSQL ``integer`` column holds never reaches a query.

Plan step balance:X-dj.  psycopg 3's SQLAlchemy dialect binds an ``Integer``
with a server-side cast (``%(id_1)s::INTEGER``), so an integer outside the
column's range is refused by the CAST -- SQLSTATE 22003, a ``DataError`` and
an unhandled 500 -- where psycopg2 inlined the literal and matched no row.

**What this module grades: the query-string integers that REACH A QUERY.**
:func:`~app.utils.digit_strings.integer_arg` holds every one of them to the
column's range and reads an out-of-range value exactly as it reads an
unparseable one -- as the site's default.  :data:`QUERY_SITES` holds one
request per code site whose integer reaches a query, from a census MEASURED
on 2026-10-05 rather than read off the code: the ``integer_arg`` reads in
``app/routes`` were driven with a value one past the ceiling and
``integer_arg`` replaced by a bare ``int()``, and eight code sites raised
``DataError`` (the quick-create form's owner lookup reads two of its
arguments, so the eight take nine requests here; a site several endpoints
reach, such as the grid partials' shared resolver, is requested once).  A
ninth site is MASKED: ``analytics.py``'s ``_resolve_window_params`` reads the
income statement's ``period_id`` into a query too, but only after the same
request's ownership check has read it, so the census saw the first site
raise and the one income-statement request grades both.  Every other site
the census drove reads its integer in Python alone -- a window offset or
length, a year or month, a cadence count, an id looked up in a calendar
already loaded or compared in a template -- so it could not 500 this way and
grades nothing here.  One read was not driven: ``investment.py``'s growth
chart ``horizon_years``, which the service clamps to 1-40 in Python.  That
every such read goes through ``integer_arg`` at all is the architecture
guard's (``tests/test_arch/test_a_query_string_integer_is_bounded.py``).

One site is not ``request.args``: the cell fragment reads the PAGE's
``account_id`` off htmx's ``HX-Current-URL`` header, through the same
``type=integer_arg`` coercion.  And the other doors a request integer
arrives through are graded where their rule lives: a PATH id by the
``<int:>`` converter (``tests/test_routes/test_url_id_converter.py``), a form
or schema id by :func:`~app.utils.digit_strings.parse_row_id` and
:class:`~app.schemas.validation._helpers.RowId`
(``tests/test_utils/test_digit_strings.py``,
``tests/test_schemas/test_row_id_field.py``).

**Every case asserts the URL still ROUTES before it reads the response**,
because a 404 from the URL map and a 404 from the code look identical and are
opposite claims about the input.

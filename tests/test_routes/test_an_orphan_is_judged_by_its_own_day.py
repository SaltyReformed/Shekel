"""A row its rule no longer names is judged by its own day at every books door (ruling R-PC98).

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, the round-5 review's H2 (developer
2026-09-23, "Own-day check, all 4").  A rule EDIT -- its start moved later,
say -- leaves the still-Projected rows it no longer produces behind: ORPHANS,
answering no occurrence the walk names, so no dropped occurrence catches them.
The review measured each door letting one through inside the books, the
opening then counting the orphan a second time (``-$20.00``).  Each door now
compares an orphan on its own day (``definition_unarchive.own_books_day``),
as ruling R-PC96 compares a rule-less or undated row at the unarchive.

The orphans here are made the way an edit leaves them: the rule's
``starts_on`` moved onto the THIRD row's occurrence, after which the first two
rows -- in paychecks the maintain pass no longer reaches -- answer nothing.

Also here, the round-5 review's other gaps on the same doors: M2, the two
envelope arms no test graded (the revert's paycheck wording and the
unarchive's own-day envelope day), and H1's placement axis -- a monthly rule
placed into the paycheck starting ON OR AFTER its occurrence, the shape of
production row 788, which the revert refusal holds.

"""Route tests for ``POST /pay-periods/earlier`` ("Add earlier paychecks").

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-b`` (ruling **R-PC87**).  The door, the
refusals and the population it owes, through the HTTP layer: what the
settings card renders and posts, the flash each outcome carries, that a
refusal writes nothing, that the new paychecks are populated where an
account's books reach them and left empty where they do not (ruling R-R38;
the books bound, ``pay_calendar:C18-a``), and owner-only access.  The service
contract is graded in ``tests/test_services/test_pay_period_earlier.py``.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- the pay periods a row may be MOVED into (plan step C2-f1)

:func:`app.routes._period_options.period_move_options` replaced
``pay_period_service.get_current_and_future_periods``, whose three call sites
rendered the same ``<select>`` from the same query.  The first three tests here
are that reader's own cases, re-pointed at the rule that replaced it -- the
behaviour did not change, so neither did the assertions.

Two things did change and are pinned below rather than left to be
rediscovered:

* the CLOCK is the user's (``display_today``) where the query used the
  process's ``date.today()``.  All three call sites already computed
  ``display_today()`` two lines further down for the settle-day input's
  ``max``, so one render held two clocks that agree only because both compose
  files pin ``TZ: America/New_York``.  Nothing moves in the container; what
  changes is that the rule stops depending on that pin;
* the result is a plain LIST, not a
  :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PeriodWindow`.  Forcing an ended period
  back in leaves a hole, and a window refuses one -- so the type would refuse
  the very case the rule exists for.

``bare_periods`` is 10 biweekly periods from 2026-01-02: index 0 = Jan 2-15,
index 1 = Jan 16-29, index 2 = Jan 30 - Feb 12, and so on.

        it to be a different list.

        **The pinned process day is deliberately not named.** ``time_machine``
        reads a naive datetime as UTC, so the LOCAL civil day it produces
        depends on the run's zone -- 2026-01-15 under UTC, 2026-01-16 under

        both zones.

        **The split does not happen in the deployed container**, and this test

        setting: both compose files pin ``TZ: America/New_York`` (the

        of UTC flipped ``date.today()`` at 20:00 Eastern and did exactly this
        to this dropdown), so the two clocks agree there.  Splitting them here
        grades the rule where the pin does not reach -- CI, a script, a bare

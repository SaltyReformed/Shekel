"""The grid cell's due-date caption: one rule, two surfaces, no query.

``grid/_transaction_cell.html`` prints ``Due: m/d`` when a row's ``due_date``
is not the PAYDAY of the paycheck it is filed in.  Two surfaces draw that
cell -- the desktop grid's row macro on a page render, and
``routes/_render_helpers.render_transaction_cell`` on every HTMX swap -- and
until pay-calendar plan step **C4-a-1** both answered the question the same
wrong way: the template read ``t.pay_period.start_date``, a lazy relationship
load issued from inside the render.

**Nothing graded any of it**, which is why this file exists.  ``grep -rn "Due:"
tests/`` came back empty the day C4-a-1 changed the line, so the whole
11,250-test suite was green either way.

**And the first fix was a bare context variable, which an adversarial review
measured as no fix at all**: Jinja's default ``Undefined`` compares unequal to
a date WITHOUT raising, so a surface that forgot to publish the payday
captioned every dated row silently.  The decision is a per-transaction MAP the
partial INDEXES for exactly that reason, which is this template's standing rule
for ``budgets``, and
:meth:`TestTheCaptionMapIsREQUIRED.test_a_render_without_the_map_FAILS` is what
holds it -- the property, rather than a paragraph claiming it.

Four properties:

* a row due AWAY from its payday is captioned, on BOTH surfaces;
* a row due ON its payday is NOT, on both -- the assertion that fails when a
  surface stops publishing the map;
* a render that publishes no map RAISES rather than captioning everything;
* and the page's ``budget.pay_periods`` query count does not grow when the same
  rows are spread across more paychecks, which is what keeps the template off
  the database.

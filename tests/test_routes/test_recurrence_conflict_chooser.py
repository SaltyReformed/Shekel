"""
Unit tests for ``app.routes._recurrence_conflict_chooser`` (Loop B, P3).

The chooser's own contracts -- parsing the per-instance keep/use decisions a
submit carries, and dispatching them without ever touching a row outside the
raised conflict set.  Split out of ``test_recurrence_form_helpers`` alongside
the module they cover (plan step R2e-1).

The route-level behaviour of the regeneration these helpers sit under lives in
``test_recurrence_clear.py`` (a cleared recurrence) and in the template /
transfer CRUD suites (an amount change).

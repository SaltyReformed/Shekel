        arrives on the investment account as transfers whose to-side it is:
        one in each period, each from the savings account the case posts
        from, at the $269.23 it posts.  The source is a second account the
        case creates, never the seeded checking: the seed's owner and its
        checking account are both id 1, so a from-side written as the owner's
        id would read as checking and pass.

        **Re-expressed onto the TRANSFER at plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3**
        (ruling **R-BAL167** class 1).  It counted the live income SHADOW
        rows on the investment account -- a ``budget.transactions`` row of
        income type carrying a ``transfer_id`` -- and a transfer is one row

        The name is the twin era's, kept so the node id is the baseline's.

        ruling that it is right.**  The route starts its every-period cadence
        at the opening of the owner's schedule (``PayCalendar.opening_bound``,
        the first payday), so it writes into EVERY period the owner has,
        closed ones included: all ten here, because ``seed_periods_today``
        resets the owner's schedule to exactly those.  Whether it should
        start at the current paycheck instead is open ledger row
        **recurrence:D34**, and a change here MOVES MONEY: started at today
        it wrote six of the ten (measured 2026-10-19), so the four earlier
        periods' 4 x $269.23 = $1,076.92 of planned contributions went.  That
        is the developer's decision, not a test edit (CLAUDE.md rule 5).  The
        read is the sorted LIST of periods, not their number or their set: a

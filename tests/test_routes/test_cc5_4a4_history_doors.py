"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``: a row holding a movement is history every door keeps.

Rulings **R-CC54** part (2), **R-CC63**, **R-CC65** and **R-CC66**
(developer 2026-09-22).  Finding **CC-363** is what each class here refuses:
the template, account and pay-period doors destroyed a payment or purchase as
a SIDE EFFECT of deleting something else, judging "history" by a row's STATUS
rather than by what it held -- and the archive hid it, which took its money
off the books just the same (measured on the 2026-09-22 production dump:
archiving 'Clothes' moved Checking's 09-10-period projection from $187.12 to
$787.12, exactly what its permanent delete did).

Every class grades the door the owner presses, through its route or its
service, and asserts the MONEY as well as the sentence: the purchase still
exists, still counts toward the account's settled cash, and its bank match
still stands.  The sentences are ruling **R-CC66**'s, verbatim where it gave
one ("'Clothes' holds a recorded purchase and cannot be permanently deleted.
It has been archived instead; the row holding it stays on your budget." --
"Pay period 9/10 holds a recorded payment or purchase; delete it from its
row first." -- the lock badge "Holds a recorded payment or purchase"), read
off the session's flashes so no HTML escaping stands between the test and
the text.

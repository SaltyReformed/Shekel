"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-3``: the popover says what taking a payment off frees.

Ruling **R-CC56** (developer 2026-09-22), verbatim: *"A caption under the
Actual box ('Recording $0.00 withdraws 1 accepted match, so 1 bank line is
unexplained again: 9/24 HOTEL -$120.00'). A second caption beside
Paid/Received on a reverted row whose purchases would replace its payment.
Both captions come from the one read the door acts on. The grid's one-click
Mark Paid withdraws and logs it without a caption, as the Paid-from change
does today."*  Ruling **R-CC54**'s one act is what the two presses reach
(``status_seam._covering._withdraw`` -> ``movement_removal.remove_movements``).

What is graded here is what the template EMITS and what its presses DO: each
caption over a matched payment and its absence where nothing would be freed;
the popover's own Save carrying ``$0.00`` (the form's controls, read off the
render, not a hand-picked payload); Paid on the reverted envelope; and the
delete dialog's sentence, whose clause this step moved into the macro the
three captions share, byte for byte.

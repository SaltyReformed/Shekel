        ``cash_ledger.reconciled_through`` -- ``MAX(observed_on)`` -- which a
        back-dated assertion does not move.  Before that step every cash true-up
        stamped today, so the submitted day and that maximum were the same value

        re-coupled them.

        What that cost: submit an OLD statement's balance and the modal opens
        against the LATEST assertion's day, offering purchases made after that
        statement.  Ticking one is a settlement the user cannot have observed,
        and it releases the envelope budget being held for it -- reproduced at
        ``$120.00`` of projected checking balance on money that never left the
        bank.

        The purchase here is dated AFTER the back-dated statement day precisely
        so it is one the statement could not show.

        BRANCHES on the surface token and a re-review proved the branch

        ``cash`` arm passed the whole 7,843-test suite.  ``cash`` is the cash

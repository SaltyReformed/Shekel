class _TestTheReconcileRouteMembers:
    """The reconcile step's two doors -- plan step S1-c, ruling R-DH (d) / 12.5.

    **This class covered a DELETED function.**  It graded
    ``entry_service.clear_entries_for_anchor_true_up``: a bulk ``UPDATE`` that
    flipped ``is_cleared = TRUE`` on every past-dated entry of a projected
    parent, fired as a side effect of every checking anchor true-up.  Whether a
    purchase counted as reconciled was therefore decided by the order two
    buttons were pressed -- record then true up and it cleared, true up then
    record and it never did -- which is 14 of the developer's 53 same-day
    entries.  The flag, the bulk update and its two log events are gone.

    What replaced it is an ASKED question rather than a guessed one: after a
    successful true-up the app lists the purchases it still thinks are
    outstanding and the user ticks the ones their statement shows
    (``GET`` / ``POST /accounts/<id>/reconcile``).  A tick stamps
    ``settled_on`` with the assertion's own ``observed_on`` -- an upper bound on
    the true posting day, and the only bound the reconciliation predicate
    consumes, so no answer changes by sharpening it.

    The per-account scoping case SURVIVES the re-ruling because the invariant
    it names is unchanged and still real: reconciling account A must not touch
    account B's purchases.  The exhaustive scoping matrix (another user, a
    credit purchase, a settled parent, an already-recorded entry) is graded at
    the service in ``test_services/test_reconcile_service.py``; what is graded here
    is the ROUTE -- that it resolves the assertion day itself, refuses a
    non-owner, and commits.

# Pre-Commit-7 the /accounts checking detail built its own transaction
# query without ``selectinload(Transaction.entries)`` (same shape as
# the savings tile pre-Commit-6) and forked on the NULL-anchor case
# differently from the grid.  The silent-degrade seam in
# ``cash_ledger._amounts._entry_aware_amount`` (closed at the math layer
# by Commit 5, structurally closed by the canonical producer in Commit
# 5) yielded $160.00 on the grid and $114.29 on /accounts for the
# audit's symptom #1 / #5 tuple.  Commit 7 routes the checking detail
# through the balance-at seam and resolves the anchor via
# the dated ``AccountAnchorHistory`` SoT, so both divergence axes
# (entries seam, NULL-anchor fork) close.  The NULL-anchor fork is
# dead post-Commit-3 and was deleted rather than left unreachable.

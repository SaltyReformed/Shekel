Shekel Budget App -- C-27 Route Input Validation Tests

Route-level coverage for commit C-27 of the 2026-04-15 security
remediation plan: every endpoint that previously hand-parsed form
input or trusted FK IDs without route-boundary ownership checks
now goes through a Marshmallow schema and/or a per-FK
``current_user.id`` probe.  The plan-cited tests live here:

  * ``transactions.mark_done`` -- parses the figure via
    :class:`MarkDoneSchema`; a malformed or negative value is
    rejected at the schema tier instead of the route's old
    ``InvalidOperation`` catch.  Its transfer-shadow branch is gone
    (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-1``), and the transfer PATCH a grid
    leg uses refuses the same figure.

  * ``transfers.create_ad_hoc`` -- route-boundary FK ownership for
    ``from_account_id``, ``to_account_id``, ``scenario_id``,
    ``category_id`` collapsed into a single loop that returns 404 on
    the first failure (``pay_period_id``'s is the service's since plan
    step ``pay_calendar:C13-b``).

  * ``transfers.update_transfer`` -- route-boundary ownership probe
    on ``category_id``, the one user-scoped FK of the two the schema
    accepts whose ownership the route checks (``pay_period_id``'s is
    the service's since plan step ``pay_calendar:C13-b``).

  * ``transfers.create_transfer_template`` /
    ``transfers.update_transfer_template`` -- ownership probes on
    every user-scoped FK accepted by the form.

The ad-hoc and update IDOR rejections return 404 (security response
rule: "404 for both not found and not yours"); the two template
routes are form posts and redirect (302) instead.  Each proves the
request wrote nothing: a create made no row, and an update left the
owner's row as it was.  On the
ad-hoc and update doors the service refuses the same references with
the same 404, so those cases grade the refusal whichever tier gives
it.

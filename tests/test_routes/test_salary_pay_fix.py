"""The salary's pay list doors: create by pay per paycheck, and Fix (plan step salary:X-av-3a).

Rulings **R-SAL59** (the stored fact is what one paycheck pays from a dated
payday on) and **R-SAL61** ("'Fix' edits one": an entry's amount, its payday,
or both).  Every POST here is what the page RENDERS, read off the page by
:class:`_FormReader` -- a hand-written payload is written by the same author
as the template and agrees with it about a mistake as readily as about the
truth.  Every figure is made up.

* create: the form's pay a paycheck and its payday become the first entry;
* Fix: the amount, the payday, both; a payday that is not one, or that another
  entry holds, is refused and nothing moves; an unchanged payday is not asked
  again (R-SAL53's shape); a stale form is refused;
* ownership: another owner's entry is a 404, paired with the owner's own POST
  to the same URL shape resolving, so the 404 is the gate's and not the URL
  map's;
* both doors take the stub door's payday rule (R-SAL48's bound, ruling
  **R-SAL90**, "Up to next payday"): a payday later than the owner's next
  one is refused, in the pay doors' own words (ruling **R-SAL93**, "Each
  door names its own"): "Pay can be recorded up to your next payday, ...",
  never the stub door's "A stub can be entered ...".

Today is pinned to 2026-03-20 (the stub tests' day): inside the seeded
schedule (biweekly from 2026-01-02), 03-13 the current payday and 03-27 the
next.

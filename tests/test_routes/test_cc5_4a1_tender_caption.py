"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1``: the "Paid from" picker says what a pick withdraws.

Ruling **R-CC46** (developer 2026-09-21): a payment re-pointed onto another
account leaves the acts naming it, withdrawn and DISCLOSED as a delete's are.
The delete discloses through its confirm dialog before the press; the "Paid
from" picker is a ``<select>`` inside the popover's Save form, so it discloses
beside the control, before the pick, in a caption the route derives through
the withdrawal's own read twin (``match_withdrawal.pending_for_moved_movement``,
the same derivation the seam's write uses at ``_re_point``).

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Dashboard Route Tests (Terminal Road rebuild, Loop B)

Tests the rebuilt dashboard page and its HTMX endpoints:

  * ``dashboard.page`` -- the pulse region (hero money, still-due totals,
    the projected-end-balance chart JSON, the STREET band's per-bill
    events + "anytime this period" shelf) plus the page-load-only position
    tracks; the degraded states (no account; no pay period covers today).
  * ``dashboard.pulse_section`` -- the ``balanceChanged`` swap target:
    the pulse partial for HTMX requests, a redirect otherwise.
  * ``dashboard.balance_section`` -- the anchor-edit revert fragment
    (``#balance-display``); the partial for HTMX, a redirect otherwise.

Route tests assert response CONTENT, not just status (testing rules).
The retired summary cards (alerts, payday, cash runway, the two-period
bills list, the savings-goal / debt cards) and their route tests were
removed in the same pass -- a sanctioned removal of developer-ruled
features (``docs/design/dashboard_card_audit.md`` "Retirements"), not
test-gaming.

The separate "Due Soon" list was likewise REMOVED by developer ruling
(``docs/design/dashboard_card_audit.md`` "Rebuild decisions" anatomy item
3, locked 2026-06-12: "it's all information that is better handled on the
grid").  The STREET band in ``_pulse.html`` is now the only per-bill
surface -- dated rows as events on the day-by-day axis, undated rows on
the "anytime this period" shelf -- and the still-due chip caption link
carries the next-period total ("next period $X . view in grid", or a
generate link when no next period exists).  The assertions below were
re-pointed at those surviving surfaces under that ruling (the sanctioned
rule-5 exception), not weakened.

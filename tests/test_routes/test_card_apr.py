"""Tests for the card's APR doors and the APR section of the Card terms card.

Plan step **credit_card:CC-3** (developer rulings **R-CC27**, the set-by-date
door plus a remove door, and **R-CC28**, the section inside R-CC25's card
once terms exist).  What is pinned:

* the set door creates the row for a date (the percent stored as a
  fraction), REWRITES the same date on a second submit, and refuses a bad
  payload writing nothing;
* the remove door deletes this card's row and 404s for any other row;
* every gate -- not yours, not a card, not found, and a card with NO terms
  (dormant: the section does not render, so the door does not serve) --
  each paired with the routing case a URL-map 404 would otherwise hide;
* the page: no APR section on a dormant card, the empty section on a
  configured card, and the series newest first with the rate in effect
  today as a percent and a remove form per row.

def _create_loan_account(seed_user, db_session, account_type, name, principal,

    """Helper to create a loan account with params for any amortizing type.

    Test contract: the ``principal`` argument is the value the test
    expects to see displayed as "Current Principal" on the loan
    card.  Pre-Commit-15 this worked because the dashboard rendered
    the unmaintained stored ``current_principal`` column verbatim;
    post-Commit-15 the dashboard reads the resolver's current_balance
    (E-18) which is derived from :class:`LoanAnchorEvent`, not the
    stored column.

    To preserve the test contract without rewriting every caller,
    this helper builds the loan with an ``original_principal`` of
    ``principal + 5000`` (simulating "$5,000 already paid down before
    the test starts") and states the lower ``principal`` as the balance
    "as of" :data:`_TRACKED_FROM` -- the day before the seeded calendar's
    first payday, i.e. "the balance when the owner began tracking this
    loan".  That is the setup door's own write (plan step R20, ruling
    R-R72 part 3): a ``tracking_start`` event, recorded by the shared
    factory exactly as ``loan.create_params`` records it.  The origination
    anchor is SYNTHESIZED from the params (no stored ``LoanAnchorEvent`` --
    matching production's ``create_params`` since the read switch retired
    that write), so the loan carries exactly ONE stored anchor event: the
    tracking-start.  *It was a ``user_trueup`` appended after the fact until
    R20*; the two sources differ in label alone, so no figure moved.

    **The assertion is dated when tracking began, not the day after
    origination** (plan step R16-b-2, rulings R-R71 / R-R72).  A loan's
    balance replays from its LATEST assertion over the CONTRACT's calendar,
    so every contractual month after the assertion that no payment record
    covers is charged.  Dated ``orig_date + 1 day``, as it was until
    R16-b-2, a 2023 mortgage read as unpaid for three years and never
    cleared -- which is what those records said, and not what any test here
    means.  Dated the day before the seeded calendar opens, every payment a
    test records (``seed_periods`` runs from 2026-01-02, so its earliest due
    date is 2026-02-01) falls AFTER the assertion, and only the months a
    test leaves unrecorded between it and the frozen 2026-03-20 today are
    charged.

    When ``principal == 0`` the gap is the full $5,000, so the
    assertion at $0 produces a paid-off loan state -- what
    ``test_refinance_paid_off_loan`` needs.  When ``principal > 0``
    the assertion at ``principal`` produces a partially-paid loan
    state -- what ``test_refinance_principal_auto_calculated`` and
    every other refinance / debt-card test needs.

    Routes through :func:`tests._test_helpers.create_loan_account` (the ONE
    shared loan builder), so the assertion is reconciled into the loan's
    genesis posting ledger in the same transaction that writes it -- exactly
    what ``loan.create_params`` does in production.  ``is_arm`` is set after:
    the flag alone moves no posting, since the rate-period engine's ARM
    branch fires only on a first-adjustment count this helper never sets
    (``rate_period_engine.py``, the ``terms.is_arm and first is not None``
    condition), and the origination rate row holds either way.  The
    hand-rolled block this replaced opened no ledger at all, so every loan
    here exercised the no-ledger fallback production never takes.

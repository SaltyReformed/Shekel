    Commit 5 of the amortization engine split
    (``docs/plans/2026-05-21-amortization-engine-split-implementation.md``)
    replaced the dashboard's three direct ``generate_schedule`` calls
    (planned, original, floor) with two composer calls; plan step R7d-g-3
    (ruling **R-R88**) then re-cut every projected figure -- the band
    chart's line, the schedule's planned rows, the breakdown's next payment
    -- onto the balance seam's plan fold (``balance_at.positions`` /
    ``loan_installments``), the walk the "Projected payoff" chip already
    read, so the composer keeps only the confirmed history and the
    contract's grid.  These tests lock the resulting behavior:

    * C5-1..C5-4 and C5-8 are "assert-unchanged" -- they pin the
      dashboard output against hand-computed expectations (one point per
      scheduled month, no ``generate_schedule`` 361-row residue artifact).
    * C5-5 is a static grep guard: the dashboard body MUST NOT call
      ``generate_schedule`` directly.
    * C5-6 / C5-7 lock the floor's "projections cancelled" semantic.

    Helper notes: ``_create_fresh_mortgage`` with
    ``origination_date=date(2026, 1, 1)`` produces a 30-year
    $250,000 / 6.5% mortgage whose first scheduled payment month is
    February 2026.  ``seed_periods[2]`` (2026-01-30 .. 2026-02-12) contains
    2/1 and ``seed_periods[3]`` (2026-02-13 .. 2026-02-26) contains no 1st,
    so a payment in the former is due Feb 1 and one in the latter Mar 1;
    both settle before the autouse-frozen today (2026-03-20) and land in the
    composer's replay window.  **Every installment due by today is paid in
    these fixtures**: an installment left unpaid past its due date is not in
    the plan (ruling D1 / finding B-9), and the fold then charges its accrued
    interest against the next payment and clears the loan in the
    post-contractual extension -- the honest shape
    ``TestAmortizationSchedule.test_schedule_lists_the_plan_when_an_installment_is_overdue``

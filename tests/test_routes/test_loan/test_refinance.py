    The refinance side is inherently forward-only (a brand-new loan from today),

    ahead and "Total Interest" the interest still to be paid.  And the current
    side is the pure CONTRACT -- ``scenarios.original_forward``, a like-for-like
    minimum-vs-minimum comparison -- never the owner's PLAN (the balance seam's
    fold, which carries a standing extra a borrower could pay on either loan;
    the builder is handed no fold at all, so that is structural).  Before these
    rules the builder used whole-schedule aggregates, counting sunk history

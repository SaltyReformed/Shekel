        Pre-Commit-5 the dashboard called ``generate_schedule``

        + term_months`` and emitted a 361st row absorbing the
        sub-penny rounding residue.  Post-Commit-5 the schedule routed
        through ``compute_payoff_scenarios`` -> ``project_forward``, which
        terminates cleanly at ``month_num == remaining_months``, absorbing
        the residue in the final scheduled month; since plan step R7d-g-3
        (ruling **R-R88**) it lists the balance seam's forward plan
        (``balance_at.loan_installments``) through the payoff, and a plan
        with no recurring payment folds the contract's own installments.
        The architecturally correct row count for a 30-year mortgage with
        nothing due yet is therefore ``term_months == 360`` -- one row per
        scheduled month, no residue artifact.  Hand-derivation:
        ``len(history_rows) == 0`` (no confirmed payments) + 360
        contractual installments, every one in the plan's future.

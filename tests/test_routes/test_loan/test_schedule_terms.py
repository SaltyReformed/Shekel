    loan due the 22nd pays Feb 22's, and its charge, cash price, balance and
    ledger entry already read Feb 22.  The page now names it the same way:
    the payment-history card lists it under ``Feb 2026`` (R-R108), and the
    schedule's row for it is ``#1 . Feb 22, 2026`` in every column -- its date,

    Feb 22's ``$100.00`` escrow.  Feb 22's charge is ``200000.00 * 0.06 / 12
    = 1000.00`` of interest and ``$100.00`` of escrow, so the payment splits
    interest ``1,000.00``, escrow ``100.00``, principal ``199.10``.  Before
    R-R109 the row read ``#2 . Mar 10, 2026`` with Mar 10's ``$300.00``
    escrow, a row total of ``$1,499.10`` -- ``$200.00`` more than moved.

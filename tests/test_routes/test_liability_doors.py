"""The LIABILITY balance doors ask for the amount owed (plan step credit_card:CC-5-5b).

Rulings, all the developer's:

* **R-CC52** -- every door that takes a balance for a LIABILITY account asks
  for the amount OWED (positive = you owe; a card's credit entered as a
  negative amount owed) and stores the held sign through the one ``owed()``
  flip, so R-CC47's premise ("every balance is what the account holds,
  negative when owed") is true by construction.
* **R-CC57** -- the anchor editor speaks owed on EVERY surface it opens from,
  and each surface keeps its own sign: a card's grid shows the held -$1,000
  its rows are summed in, and the editor it opens pre-fills 1,000.00.
* **R-CC58** -- the create form's box is labelled by the type picked (a
  script), and without the script it names both cases.
* **R-CC53** -- a loan's read-only anchor cell shows no figure and points to
  the loan's page.

Every figure is hand-computed from one rule: a liability holds MINUS what it
owes, and an asset's figure crosses unchanged.  A card owing ``$1,000.00``
holds ``-1,000.00``; one holding a ``$50.00`` credit holds ``+50.00``.  The
money is graded here at the route, where the crossing lives; the crossing's
own contract (both directions, every category) is
``tests/test_services/test_liability_sign.py``.

**Each stored-sign case reads the ROW back**, not the response, because a door
that stored the typed figure unchanged renders a plausible page too.

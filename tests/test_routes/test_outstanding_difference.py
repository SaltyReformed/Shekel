"""The Outstanding difference card, at its two mounts (plan step X-f3c-3).

What an account's own books cannot explain, beside whether an imported bank
statement has checked the days it accumulated over.  Money-neutral: nothing on
this card writes, and the act that ACCEPTS the figure is plan step X-f3c-4.

**What is graded here and what is graded one layer down.**  The service suites
own the money -- ``tests/test_services/test_outstanding_difference.py`` owns
the subtraction and its scope, and
``tests/test_services/test_bank_agreement.py`` owns the span verdict and its
four firing controls.  This file owns what a browser can reach: that the card
renders on the page AND through its refresh fragment, that both mounts publish
the same figures, that an account the question does not apply to gets no card
rather than an empty one, and that neither another owner's account nor a kind
this page does not serve can reach it.

**The kind gate is not ceremony.**  ``GET /accounts/<loan id>/balance-history``
once rendered a cash card for an amortizing account, captioned with copy that
is false for a loan, because a fragment added in a module the page imports
guarded on ownership alone (``app.routes.accounts._cash_page``).  This
fragment is that same shape, so the same case is asserted for it.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transaction Route Guard Tests

Tests for the guards on every transaction mutation route: a soft-deleted
row cannot be settled, a loan account admits no transaction, a transfer's
due date moves through its leg's door, and regular transactions are
unaffected.  The cases that pressed each door on a transfer SHADOW row were
deleted at plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3 (ruling R-BAL300), where no
shadow can be stored; the note where they stood says what grades the rest.

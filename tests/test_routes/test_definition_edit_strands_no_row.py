"""
Shekel Budget App -- A recurring definition's edit never strands a projected row below its books

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, rulings **R-PC90** (refuse an account move
that strands a still-projected row) and **R-PC91** (widened to ANY save:
the edit door checks the state the save would leave, whatever field
changed).  A recurring definition's occurrences start above its accounts'
books (ruling **R-PC85**), so a save that leaves a live, still-Projected row
of the definition on or before them leaves that row named by no occurrence,
and the regeneration in the same save retires it -- the forecast rises by
its amount without a word.  Both template edit doors refuse instead, roll
the edit back and say which row.

Every POST here carries what the edit form renders (a route test that posts
a hand-picked payload can pass against an arm a browser never reaches):
the envelope box is posted only when ticked, as a browser posts a checkbox.

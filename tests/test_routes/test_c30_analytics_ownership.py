Shekel Budget App -- C-30 Analytics Cross-User Ownership Tests

Route-level coverage for commit C-30 of the 2026-04-15 security
remediation plan: ``analytics.calendar_tab`` rejects a cross-user
or non-existent ``account_id`` with 404 (F-039), and the analytics
route that lifts a ``period_id`` off the query string rejects a
cross-user or non-existent one with 404 (F-098).

Threat model.  Both gaps shared the same shape: the route lifted a
foreign-key id straight off the query string and handed it to the
service layer, which itself either silently fell back to a user-
scoped default (calendar) or read victim metadata into the response
label (the period_id vector).  Neither service raised a security
exception, so the IDOR probe surfaced as a normal-looking 200
instead of a 404, masking the boundary breach behind plausible
response bodies.

  * F-039 (calendar): ``calendar_service._resolve_account`` checks
    ownership but on failure silently falls through to the user's
    own default checking account -- the requester sees their own
    data with no error.  An attacker probing for valid victim
    account ids cannot distinguish "owned" from "not owned" but
    also gets no security signal.  The route-level 404 closes the
    silent-fallback gap and emits the standard
    ``access_denied_cross_user`` audit event.

  * F-098 (period_id): a windowed report's txn filter joins
    ``account_id`` (user-owned) with ``pay_period_id`` and so
    returns no rows on a cross-user period_id, BUT the service
    reads ``PayPeriod.start_date`` for the window LABEL without an
    ownership re-check, leaking the victim's start_date into the
    response.  The variance tab that first carried this vector was
    retired at Slice 4 (its route now redirects); the income
    statement inherited the same period_id shape and carries the
    route-boundary guard, so the F-098 coverage lives there now.

The route-level guard delegates ownership to
:func:`app.utils.auth_helpers.get_or_404` (Pattern A in
``auth_helpers``) so the existing structured logging contract
(INFO ``resource_not_found`` for missing pk, WARNING
``access_denied_cross_user`` for cross-user pk) covers both the
analytics routes and every other route that uses the helper.

Test scope.  The calendar finding is exercised through the HTMX
partial path and the direct (non-HTMX) shell path.  The calendar CSV
export was removed with P-AN4, and D13 makes a direct tab GET render
the analytics shell instead of redirecting; the ownership guard runs
before the shell render on that path, so a cross-user account_id still
404s rather than being served a page.  The income statement period_id
guard is exercised through HTML and across window types that ignore
period_id downstream -- the boundary check must not depend on whether
the value happens to be consumed.

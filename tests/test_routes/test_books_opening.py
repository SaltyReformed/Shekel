"""The books-opening restatement door, at its two entrances (plan step X-f3c-2b-2a).

**One door, two entrances** (developer ruling, 2026-08-31).  The FORM lives on
the shared account edit page, which is the surface every account kind reaches
(the cockpit card's kebab -> Edit); the balance-history card on the cash detail
page LINKS to it.  The opening is DISPLAYED only on that card, and that page
serves three of the developer's nine accounts -- while four of the other six
carry a ``migration_derived`` opening the balance fold READS, so a door
reachable only from the card would leave the accounts most likely to hold a
wrong figure with no way to correct one.

**Both entrances existed and an ARCHIVED account could click NEITHER** (finding
**N-430**, closed by plan step X-f3c-2b-2d).  The cockpit replaces an archived
account's cell with a drawer card, and that card emitted no ``href`` naming its
account at all -- so the surface "every account kind reaches" was reachable only
by typing its URL, and the account-10 repair runbook had to unarchive the twin
and re-archive it to restate books the door would have accepted either way.  The
drawer card carries the same plain *Edit* link the live cell's kebab does now,
so the FORM entrance is reached from both states of an account.  The second
entrance is not, and deliberately is not chased here: it sits on a cash detail
page an archived account links to from nowhere, which is **N-453**'s question
and ``balance:X-f4``'s to answer.

**What is graded here and what is graded one layer down.**  The service suite
(``tests/test_services/test_opening_restatement.py``) owns the money: the
append, ruling **R-EQ**'s did-this-change decision, both day bounds, and the
posted ledger following.  This file owns what a browser can reach -- that both
entrances exist, that the form POSTS what the door reads, that an owner cannot
touch another owner's books, and that a refusal is rendered rather than
swallowed.

**The form-posts-what-the-door-reads case is not ceremony.**  A hand-picked
payload can green-light a route whose real form emits different field names --
this project has shipped a primary arm that was DEAD in a browser exactly that
way -- so the field names asserted below are read out of the RENDERED page.

    """Every HTTP door that creates a pay period fills it with its templates.

    **This class is what makes ruling R-R38 safe.**  Until plan step R7d-c-1
    the recurring rows were generated INSIDE ``extend_pay_periods`` /
    ``regenerate_pay_periods`` / ``reset_pay_periods``, so no caller could get
    them wrong.  They are now a second call the ROUTE makes -- the read pass
    the recurrence resolves in may only be opened at the HTTP boundary, and
    only after the paydays exist -- and a route that made the first call and
    not the second would ship paydays with no rent, no paycheck and no
    recurring transfer in them, with every period-count assertion in this file
    still green.

    So the coverage is stated where the composition now lives: one case per
    door, each asserting the ROWS rather than the count, each driven through
    the real HTTP request the browser makes.  ``test_pay_period_extend`` and
    its siblings grade the two halves separately; this grades that the doors
    call both.

    SIX doors create a pay period through HTTP: extend, regenerate, reset and
    generate directly, and the rolling top-up through ``GET /grid`` and
    ``GET /dashboard``. The sixth, ``POST /pay-periods/generate``, populated
    NOTHING until this step -- ledger row **D58**, pre-existing and found by
    censusing the writers R-R38 split. It reads as a first-time-only door and
    is not: ``record_paydays``' forward-only rule accepts any payday past the
    owner's last, so on an owner who already had a schedule it appended
    periods and skipped every template, measured through this same HTTP door
    at 3 appended periods holding 0 template rows.

    The seventh writer, ``registration_service.register_user``, has no HTTP door of
    its own here and is correct as it stands: no template can exist at
    registration, and the baseline scenario is created after that call, so a
    repopulation would return 0 on ``ctx.scenario is None``.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- C-21 Follow-up: Broad State Machine Rollout

Verifies that ``verify_transition`` is wired into every state-changing
endpoint that previously bypassed it: mark_done, cancel_transaction,
and unmark_credit.  Cancelled and Credit rows can no longer slip
into Paid/Received via these endpoints; identity transitions still
succeed so HTMX double-clicks remain idempotent.

Audit reference: F-046 / F-047 / F-161 -- broad rollout following the
2026-04-15 commit C-21.

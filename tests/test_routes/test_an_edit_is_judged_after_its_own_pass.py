"""
Shekel Budget App -- A definition's edit is judged on the rows its own regeneration leaves

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, the round-7 review's M1.  The edit doors
refuse a save that leaves a still-projected row of the definition inside the
books of the account it sits on (rulings **R-PC91** and **R-PC99**), and the
state a save leaves includes the regeneration it runs: a row that pass brings
into line takes the rewritten due day and accounts (in the paycheck it
keeps), a row it retires is gone, and every other row -- a paycheck ending
before the edit's effective date, a row the pass keeps as a conflict -- is
left as stored.  Asked of the STORED rows instead, one save that unticked an
envelope and moved its due day was refused over a day the save moves the row
off, where the same two edits as two saves passed (a regression against
``53d463ba``).

**That regression's lever went at plan step recurrence:R5-a**: the rule's
due day was dropped (ruling **R-R96**), and a row is now due on its
occurrence or its funding payday.  So the three cases that moved the due day
now MOVE THE ACCOUNT instead, the other half of what a rewrite carries, and
the rewritten DUE DAY is graded by the one save that still re-dates a row the
pass keeps: a switch of the paycheck that funds it (developer, 2026-09-24,
rule 5).

The refusal reads the pass's own decision
(``RecurrenceConflictKind.preview_fn``), never a second spelling of its
window, and each case below fails under one of the shortcuts that would
re-spell it: judging every row as stored (the regression), judging a
rewritten row on its stored due day, skipping every rewritten row, ignoring
the effective date, treating a row the pass keeps as a conflict as
rewritten, asking a retired row, or naming the books of the account a
rewritten row leaves.

Dates are the fixed ``seed_periods`` calendar (paychecks from 2026-01-02,
every 14 days), so the effective date each save states picks the window:
02-27..03-12 is the fifth paycheck, 03-13..03-26 the sixth.  Every POST
carries what the edit form renders, the envelope box only when ticked.

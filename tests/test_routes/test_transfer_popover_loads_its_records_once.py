"""Ledger row BAL-530: the transfer popover loads its legs' records ONCE.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``.  ``GET /transfers/<id>/full-edit`` reads the
legs' records -- each side's covering movement -- for three things: the
figures, both day boxes and the withdrawal caption.  Until that step the
figures and the caption each called
``transfer_legs.covering_movements_by_leg``, so one render ran the join twice;
the route now loads the records once and hands the same dict to every reader
(``routes/transfers/forms.get_full_edit``).

The loader is reached through three names -- the package attribute the route
calls, ``_render_helpers``' own import, and ``_records``' internal calls (the
grid's leg builders) -- so the spy stands in all three places, and a render
that reached the join by any of them is counted.

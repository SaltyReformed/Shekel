"""
Tests for the retired /obligations route.

The standalone obligations page was retired in the Recurring cluster
overhaul (Loop B): its monthly-equivalent committed totals moved into the
unified /templates (Recurring) surface's summary band and section
subtotals, and the dashboard / grid own the balance projection it used to
duplicate.  The /obligations URL is kept only as a redirect so old
bookmarks land on the surface that replaced it.

The monthly-equivalent arithmetic these tests used to assert now lives in
``tests/test_services/test_recurring_view.py`` (producer) and
``tests/test_routes/test_recurring_list.py`` (rendered surface).

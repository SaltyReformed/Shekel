"""The transfer EDIT form's lock affordance, computed for THIS edit.

Plan step **R7d-f-5**, rulings **R-R78** (the module split) and **R-R79** (the
affordance).  The create form has shipped two sets of destination ids since
plan steps R7c-b and R7d-f-3 -- every loan of the owner, and the payment-less
subset -- so ``recurrence_form.js`` can lock the "Starts on" and "Ends" rows the
moment such a loan is chosen.  The edit form shipped neither, on the premise
that it "already knows" whether its template is a loan payment; plan step
R7d-f-4 made that premise false, because the UPDATE door now derives the same
bounds for two edits the server cannot see at render -- a cadence added to a
one-time transfer into a loan, and a repeating transfer moved onto one -- so
the form invited a start the save replaces and a stop the save refuses.

**What the edit form emits is decided the way the door decides the same edit**
(:func:`~app.routes._loan_destination.loan_destination_locks_for_edit`): a
definition ruling **R-R76** pins to its loan may not move at all, so it ships
an EMPTY set and a DISABLED destination control carrying the refusal's
sentence; every other definition ships the owner's payment-less loans.

**Re-cut at plan step R7d-g-2**: ONE set (ruling **R-R81** -- the door derives
a second transfer's start no longer, so the wider "every loan" set that locked
the "Starts on" row alone is gone with the derivation, and with it the stored
destination carve-out); and the pin's standing arm has an ARCHIVED reading
(ruling **R-R86**, ``bounds_are_the_loans``): a transfer archived into a loan
that holds no active payment OLDER than it -- the seam's own oldest-active
reading -- renders as the standing payment does, both rows locked, the
destination pinned, and a crafted bound is refused.  The cases that moved say
so.

Rendered HTML can see the attributes, the ``disabled`` flag and the help text;
whether the script actually locks a row when a listed loan is chosen is
``tests/manual/verify_recurrence_form.py``'s, because a rendered page cannot
tell a control a script disabled from one it never touched.  Every negative
control named in a docstring below was executed as a mutation while this module
was written.

Two tests elsewhere had their premise reversed by this step's ruling
(CLAUDE.md rule 5's exception, developer 2026-09-12):
``test_transfers.py::TestTemplateList`` no longer asserts an edit form ships no
sets, and ``test_transfer_create_derived_stop.py``'s help-sentence case asserts
the edit form carries both sentences too.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- The RECONCILE page, through HTTP

Plan step **bank_import:X-gj-1b**; rulings **bank_import:R-HP** through
**R-HX**.  One page on four verbs, replacing the review queue, the register
and the hand-build workbench.

**The cases that matter most read the page and post its own bytes back.**  A
hand-picked payload is written by the same person as the template, so the two
agree about a mistake as readily as about the truth -- and this arc has paid
for that twice, once shipping a destination arm that was DEAD in a browser.
:func:`~tests.test_routes._statement_forms.reconcile_form_fields` scrapes what
a browser would submit, unticked checkboxes and all.

**The ownership 404s are PAIRED with a case asserting the URL still routes.**
A 404 from the URL MAP and a 404 from the ownership gate are indistinguishable
in a response, so moving or renaming a route leaves its IDOR control passing
and guarding nothing -- measured once on a door that DESTROYS budget rows.

    what it had scraped, and that value is one a browser could not produce for
    most cards: the ``ok-<line>`` checkbox is rendered only where a card
    suggests a verb whose door exists, so 31 of the developer's 248 cards
    carried a panel button pointing at an element that was not in the
    document -- a primary control, dead in a browser, with every server test
    green.  A helper that accepts whatever a caller appends turns a faithful
    scrape back into a hand-picked payload, and the next author in a hurry
    re-abuses it; this one cannot be.

    **It is asked as a PAIR for a checkbox or radio.**  ``ok`` is one name
    shared by every card and keyed by its value, so a check that only asked
    whether the page renders ``ok`` anywhere would pass exactly the payload
    that hid the defect.

    A case that genuinely needs to post an unrendered control -- a crafted
    body, a stale page -- posts through ``auth_client`` directly and says so,

            **The pane's controls are the page's once it has loaded**, and
            that is the document a browser submits: the fragment replaces the
            placeholder inside the card, so its rows, its attribution select
            and its consent box are all inside the cards form.  Without this
            the refusal above would reject the very payload a browser sends

    row lists -- a tier's PROPOSAL (``id="proposed-<line>-..."``) and the
    candidate list this caveat is rendered in (``id="row-<line>-..."``) -- and
    only the second carries the badge at all.  A first version of the
    discriminating case gave its row the line's own figure, so a tier proposed
    it and it rendered in the FIRST list: the case passed with the badge forced

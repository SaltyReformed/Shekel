"""
Shekel Budget App -- Tests for the tax-law notice on every owner page (plan step salary:X-at-4).

From November 1, every page the owner opens carries a banner until next year's
tax law is in the app (rulings salary:R-SAL74 and R-SAL87), naming what is
missing and the year whose rules price it meanwhile (R-SAL86).  It has no
close button, and a companion never sees it.

Every law is made up and installed through the ``tax_law`` fixture, and the
day is set by replacing :func:`app.utils.dates.display_today` -- the one clock
the notice reads -- so nothing here moves when a real year is published or
when the weekly calendar sweep fakes the date.

"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5`` leaf 5c-1: the reconcile panel names what a tick frees.

Three rulings, graded through the panel's own route as a browser drives it
(every number and hidden input the form renders, plus the ticked checkboxes):

* **R-CC125** (developer 2026-09-30, "Refuse it now"): *"The panel refuses a
  $0.00 payment today ... 'Hotel: a payment can't be $0.00. If it wasn't
  paid, leave it unticked or cancel it on the grid.' Nothing changes"* --
  the row box and the transfer box alike.
* **R-CC126** (developer 2026-09-30, "Only the card offers it"): *"Checking's
  list leaves it out ... so reconciling never moves a payment."*
* **R-CC76** with **R-CC127** (developer 2026-09-23 / 2026-09-30): the panel
  names what a tick would free before the press, from the same read it acts
  on, and posts back what it named; *"on the reconcile panel, one out-of-date
  row means nothing on it saves"*.  The one tick left that frees a line is an
  envelope settling FROM its purchases while holding the payment a revert
  kept, and its caption is the shared clause (the coordinator's application
  of R-CC56 / R-CC80, 2026-10-04): *"Closing it from its purchases withdraws
  1 accepted match, so 1 bank line is unexplained again on your statement
  screen: ..."*.

Every figure and bank line here is a made-up example.

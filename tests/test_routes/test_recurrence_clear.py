"""
Shekel Budget App -- Clearing a recurring definition (plan step R2e-1)

The TRANSFER edit form offers "Does not repeat" as a recurrence pattern.
Choosing it must mean what it says: the template stops naming a rule, the rule
row ceases to exist, and the instances that rule already generated stop
occupying future pay periods.

**The TRANSACTION form no longer offers it, and its schema REFUSES the empty
unit** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-7b``, ruling **R-BAL23**, developer
2026-09-13 for the edit form too): a transaction definition with no rule is a
ONE-OFF, made at the Budget grid through the one-off producer, so clearing a
cadence from the form would manufacture rule-less definitions holding
scattered rows listed nowhere.  The transaction class below grades the
REFUSAL -- the rule and every row stand -- and the sweep's own semantics
(what a cleared cadence retires and retains) stay graded on the transfer
twin here and on the engine in ``test_recurrence_engine``.

**It meant none of those things.**  Measured on a real edit of an
every-paycheck template before this step::

    rule_id before: 1   rows: 10
    rule_id after:  1   rows: 10
    (log) deleted_count=6  created_count=6

The builder returned ``None`` for an unselected pattern, the resolver assigned
nothing, and the route then regenerated from the rule the user had just asked
it to stop using -- so the option was not merely inert, it re-materialised the
recurrence it was supposed to end.

The properties pinned here, because getting one right at the cost of another is
the failure mode:

1. the rule is DETACHED and DELETED (a detached rule is finding **F-6**'s leak);
2. the future auto-generated rows are swept from the edit's effective date,
   while settled, soft-deleted and hand-edited rows inside that same window
   survive;
3. a template that NEVER recurred is untouched -- a RULE-LESS transfer
   template's single Transfer is an ordinary auto-generated row, so a sweep
   gated only on "has no rule now" would delete it on a rename;
4. the amount chooser is not offered, because it would ask an amount question
   about rows the request is deleting;
5. a LOAN PAYMENT refuses to be cleared at all -- its cadence is what the
   balance seam projects the loan against;
6. only the owner can reach the path (it DELETEs a row, so 404 is asserted
   directly rather than inferred from the shared ``get_or_404``).

The transfer half is covered too: the same helpers serve both kinds, and plan
step R2e-3 points the transfer form's null option at this exact path when it
retires the ``Once`` pattern.

        Plan step ``pay_calendar:C14-f``, ruling **R-PC63**.  P80 is
        *"no check anywhere sees an IRREGULAR payday set"*: this door accepted
        any payday at or after the owner's floor, so three posts naming
        unrelated days wrote ``[2026-01-02, 2026-01-16, 2026-07-31]`` at
        cadence 14 and derived a **196-day paycheck** -- six months of rows
        filing into one grid column, with ``scripts/integrity_check.py``
        reporting green.

        The step was originally specified as a CHECK for that state
        (**R-PC55**).  A check is a reconciler for a duplication and rule 14
        says delete a home instead, so the door stopped asking an owner who
        already holds a rhythm to restate it.  The bad state is unrepresentable
        **through this door**, which is why this asserts the SPACING rather
        than a warning.

        **IT DOES NOT CLOSE P80, and a first draft of this docstring said it
        did.**  This step's adversarial review found ``regenerate`` still
        renders a "Corrected first payday" with no ceiling, and the same
        irregular set was then MEASURED through that route: a **140-day gap**,
        HTTP 200.  P80's own predicate -- *no check anywhere sees an irregular
        payday set* -- is still true after this change.  The row stays OPEN and
        the remaining door is named in the route's own comment.

        **Posted as a client would, not as the form emits.**  The card is not
        rendered for an owner who holds paydays, so a browser cannot reach this
        at all -- and that is exactly why the test must not go through one.
        P80's write was a direct POST; the UI is an affordance and the route is
        the control.

        *What this case no longer covers, said out loud so its absence is not
        read as a gap*: it asserted **R-PC1**'s forward-only floor and the 422
        that renders it.  This door cannot reach that refusal any more, because
        it no longer forwards a payday.  The rule itself is unmoved and is
        covered at its own layer -- ``test_pay_period_write.py`` pins the
        message in seven places, and the doors that still state a payday
        (regenerate, reset) still meet it.

        **This case asserted the OPPOSITE until plan step
        ``pay_calendar:C4-c``**, and the inversion is that step in one
        property.  The horizon was the LAST ROW'S STORED ``end_date``, written
        at whatever cadence the batch that created it ran at; editing
        ``budget.pay_schedule.cadence_days`` afterwards -- finding **P28**'s
        legacy shape -- left the two disagreeing, and a later generate
        rewrote the stored end DOWN to the new cadence's projection.  A door
        could therefore take a settled row's cash day out of every paycheck.

        There is one value now.  The floor is ``latest payday + the stored
        cadence`` and the new horizon is ``new payday + the new cadence - 1``,
        so a batch that RECORDS a payday leaves the horizon at least
        ``old horizon + the new cadence`` -- strictly greater, for every
        cadence in 1..365.  A batch every one of whose requested paydays
        already exists records none, and ``_apply`` then skips
        ``upsert_schedule`` entirely, so the horizon is unchanged and the post
        is still accepted: **non-decreasing** is the property this door has,
        and strictly increasing is what it has when it writes.  *An adversarial
        review corrected that sentence, 2026-09-01.*  Either way the state the
        deleted case built is unreachable through this door, and this is the
        assertion that says so rather than the absence of a test.

        Driven at the SMALLEST cadence the schema admits, because that is where
        the margin is thinnest: one day.

        **Since plan step ``pay_calendar:C14-f`` the property holds for a
        STRONGER reason** (ruling **R-PC63**): this owner already has a rhythm,
        so the door no longer forwards the submitted payday or cadence at all
        -- it continues the stored one, and a tail-append cannot move an
        existing end. The margin argument above is what protected the case
        while the door could still state a cadence, and it is kept because the
        doors that still can (regenerate, reset) rest on it.

"""Plan step balance:X-bn -- where a request's owner lock is taken, and where it ends.

The owner's write lock is taken where each command transaction a signed-in
request opens begins (:mod:`app.db_transaction`).  Three rulings and one rule-5
approval decide the edges of that, and each is graded here with the arm that
proves it fires:

* **R-CC121** ("Lock, then check"): sign-in finds the account, takes the
  signing-in person's owner lock, and only then reads the codes or the
  failed-attempt count.  Graded by statement ORDER on the password step (a
  wrong password writes ``failed_login_count``) and the backup-code step (the
  code check reads ``auth.mfa_configs``), by the count being read AGAIN under
  the lock and a race proving it (another transaction raises the count while
  the sign-in waits, and the sign-in counts on top of it), and by a held key
  making each step WAIT, with the free-key control beside it.  A companion's
  sign-in takes its OWNER's key.
* **R-CC122** ("Refusals first"): a request the form-token check or the
  app-wide rate limit refuses never takes the lock.  The registration ORDER is
  pinned by the exact hook list in ``tests/test_routes/test_auth_required.py``,
  the only arm that sees the rate-limit half (``TestConfig`` switches the
  limiter off); this module grades the form-token half's behaviour, with the
  control that the same request takes the owner's key once the check lets it
  through.
* **R-CC123**: a request's transaction -- and the lock riding it -- ends where
  the request ends, as production's app-context teardown ends it.  Graded on a
  correct-password sign-in, which commits nothing, so its transaction would
  otherwise outlive the request under the test client's shared app context.
* **The rule-5 approval of 2026-09-25** (the lock sits BEFORE the sign-in
  gate): a companion deactivated while their save waits for the owner's lock
  is turned away, because taking the lock expires the signed-in user's row and
  the gate reads ``is_active`` again after the wait.  The control is the same
  wait with the companion left active, which saves.

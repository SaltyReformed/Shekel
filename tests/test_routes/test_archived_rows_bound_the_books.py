"""An archived definition's hidden rows bound its accounts' books (ruling R-PC93).

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, the round-2 adversarial review's H-B.
Archiving a recurring definition hides its still-Projected rows and
unarchiving brings them back, so a books move made while it was archived saw
nothing to strand: measured before the fix, the restatement COMMITTED, the
transaction template's unarchive restored a row below the new books, and the
transfer template's unarchive -- whose maintain pass retires a row the rule no
longer names -- HARD-DELETED the current paycheck's transfer.  Josh ruled
2026-09-23, "Refuse the books move": the rows an unarchive would restore count
as planned rows at every door that moves a definition's books, and the
refusal names such a row as the archived definition's with the remedy that
reaches it.

The archive and the unarchive run through their ROUTES here, so what they
hide and restore is theirs and not a fixture's imitation; the restatement runs
through its service door, whose refusal is what R-PC93 changes.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- the pay stub entry door's routes (plan step salary:S11-b).

The five routes of :mod:`app.routes.salary.stubs` and the paycheck-line delete
refusal, driven through the test client:

* the entry flow picks the payday first (ruling **R-SAL50**): a non-payday is
  refused at step 1, a held payday opens its stub, a free one renders the form
  with the lines the app takes that payday first;
* a record, an edit and the "Use for pricing" switch each write through the
  service and redirect; a refusal re-renders the form with every figure the
  owner typed (a 422), and writes nothing;
* every door is the owner's: another owner's profile or stub is a 404 -- each
  paired with the owner's own request to the SAME ROUTE succeeding, so a 404
  from the URL map cannot pass for the ownership gate.  The attacker is
  ``auth_client`` against the second owner's rows, the shape the suite's own
  IDOR cases use (``test_savings``' ``test_goal_idor_view_blocked``);
* the form POSTED here is the form the template EMITS: its field names are
  read off the rendered page and compared with the payload's;
* deleting a paycheck line a stub names is refused with **R-SAL51** (c)'s
  wording, and the line stays;
* the job's answer to "my stub's gross includes after-tax earnings"
  (**R-SAL102**) reaches the door, the line under the gross box says what
  this job's gross counts, a refusal naming the setting ends in a link to it
  (**R-SAL104**, **R-SAL106**), and both links open a new tab (**R-SAL107**)
  -- changing the setting there leaves the open stub form submittable.  The
  words are **R-SAL114** to **R-SAL117**'s (the approved list, **R-SAL115**).

The figures are the service suite's worked example
(``tests/test_services/test_pay_stub_service.py``): the 03-27 stub prints a
gross of ``$2,999.62`` and nets ``$2,102.62``.  Today is frozen at 2026-03-20,
so 03-27 is the next payday.

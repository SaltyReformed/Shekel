"""The conflict chooser's "use the template" restores only what un-archiving would.

Ruling R-BAL253.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``, the cp5 leaf review's M-1.  A recurring
definition's edit with an early "effective from" date offers every deleted
occurrence in its window, and "use the template" brought each one back without
asking the books -- the day an account's balance starts -- where un-archiving
the definition leaves a row its books hold deleted and names it (rulings
**R-PC95** and **R-PC99**).  Measured before the fix through the real routes:
a $50.00 every-paycheck Checking -> Savings transfer due on Savings' opening day,
marked Paid and then deleted (so returned to a plan and hidden, ruling
**R-BAL246**), came back from the chooser as a live plan INSIDE the books, its
$50.00 counted a second time.  Deleted bills had the same hole (ledger row
**REC-535**).  Josh ruled 2026-10-09, "Leave it deleted, both kinds": "'Use the
template' brings back only what un-archiving would: an item whose due day sits
inside its books stays deleted, and the page names it the way un-archiving
does".

Every act runs through its ROUTE -- the edit, the chooser it renders, and the
Apply that page posts, built from the controls the page renders -- and every
outcome is graded by re-reading the rows after the request ended.

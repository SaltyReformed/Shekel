"""
Shekel Budget App -- Grid Entry Progress Indicator Tests (Commit 7)

Tests the entry progress display ("X / Y" format) and enhanced tooltip
for tracked transactions in the grid cell and mobile grid views.

Covers:
  - build_entry_sums_dict computation correctness (unit tests).
  - Cell endpoint rendering with progress format (integration tests).
  - Tooltip enhancement with entry breakdown.
  - Non-tracked transaction regression (display unchanged).
  - Grid page flow: entry_sums passes through to template context.

    the companion view and the full-edit popover all render the same partial
    from :func:`build_entry_lists_dict`, which did not, and Jinja answers
    ``entry.id in Undefined`` as ``False`` silently.  So on every initial
    render an already-posted purchase read *"Still outstanding"* while the
    projection had already released its reservation -- 9 of 9 such purchases
    on the 2026-08-13 production clone.

    A missing key cannot fail loudly in Jinja, so it is graded here instead:
    the producer supplies the whole context, and the macro is asserted to
    unpack every key of it.

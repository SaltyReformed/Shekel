"""Tests for the owner-role MFA enrolment nag banner (F-095 / C-12).

Covers the ``inject_mfa_nag_visible`` context processor in
``app/__init__.py`` and the ``dashboard/_mfa_nag.html`` partial that
``base.html`` includes when the flag is truthy.

The banner must:

* Render for owner-role users who have no MFA enabled.
* Stay hidden for owners who DO have MFA enabled.
* Stay hidden for companion-role users (the audit scopes the nag to
  the de facto administrator role).
* Stay hidden for anonymous visitors (they cannot enrol from /login).
* Stay suppressed on the ``auth.mfa_*`` endpoints themselves so the
  banner does not stack on top of the page that fulfils the nag.
* Appear consistently across owner-role pages (the nag is global, not
  dashboard-specific) -- this is C-12's "more robust than the plan"
  expansion of "every owner-role landing page".

The marker the assertions check for is ``id="mfa-nag-banner"`` from the
partial.  Asserting on the DOM id rather than the copy text means the
copy can be tweaked without breaking the test, while still proving the
banner element rendered.

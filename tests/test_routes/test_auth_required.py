"""Every route the application serves refuses an anonymous request, or is named.

**The sweep's subject is the route table, not a list.**  Until plan step
``bank_import:X-gi-4`` this file was a hand-typed ``PROTECTED_ENDPOINTS`` of
124 ``(method, path)`` pairs whose docstring said a new route "must be added"
to it, and finding **N-402** measured what that sentence is worth: the
application served 222 pairs, 213 of them behind ``@login_required``, and the
list had drifted by 89 with every check green -- a gate whose coverage is a
list somebody remembers to update reports clean over exactly what it cannot
see.  The remedy the developer chose (ruling **bank_import:R-BI4**) removed
the thing being counted: ``app/login_gate.py`` refuses every request that is
not authenticated and not declared public, in ONE ``before_request`` hook,
and no view carries a decorator any more.  So this file grades the gate,
and its cases are ENUMERATED from ``url_map`` the way
``test_no_baseline_policy`` enumerates its own: a route added a year from now
is a case here without its author knowing this file exists.

What is graded, and how each arm is kept honest:

* **every ``(method, rule)`` outside :data:`~app.login_gate.PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS`
  bounces an anonymous request to the login page**, with ``next`` carrying
  the path.  One test per pair, so a failure names the route.
* **every public pair is NOT decided by the gate** -- asserted on the gate's
  DECISION rather than on the response shape, because ``/mfa/verify`` with no
  pending second factor redirects to the login page on its own, and a
  "not a login redirect" arm would read the view's redirect as the gate's.
  The decision is observed by counting calls to the one function the gate
  can end a request with, :meth:`~flask_login.LoginManager.unauthorized`.
  The allowlist is therefore a CLAIM with its own firing arm, not a skip.
* **the allowlist's exact contents are pinned**, so opening a route is a
  visible diff in two files; and every name in it resolves in the route
  table, so a renamed view cannot leave a stale entry exempting nothing.
* **the table the cases were derived from is the table the fixture app
  serves**, pair for pair, so the enumeration cannot silently shrink.
* **an unmatched URL is bounced too** (the one place the gate is stricter
  than the decorator it replaced, chosen by the developer 2026-09-11), and an
  authenticated user still gets Flask's 404 or 405 there.
* **the two exemptions the decorator had are the gate's** -- ``OPTIONS`` and
  ``LOGIN_DISABLED`` -- each with the arm that proves the switch is a switch.
* **the hook's place in the request** is pinned: after CSRF and the rate
  limiter, before the session-activity stamp.

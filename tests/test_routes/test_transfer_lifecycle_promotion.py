"""Every door where a definition BECOMES a loan's standing payment derives its start.

Plan step **R7d-g-2**, ruling **R-R85** (the ONE entry helper) with rulings
**R-R81** (the standing payment's start is the contract's, a second
transfer's its owner's) and **R-R82** (a stop the owner authored earlier is
honoured, never rewritten).  Under ruling **R-R29** the standing payment's
``starts_on`` is a stored derived value; R7d-g-1 left its maintenance
contract with holes -- healed at the next params edit -- and this leaf closes
them at the doors themselves.  Each door, once its write is flushed, calls
``_loan_destination.sync_loan_payment_start_or_refuse``, which asks the seam
who is standing NOW and brings that definition's start onto the contract:

* ARCHIVE and HARD-DELETE (both arms) take the standing payment out of the
  active set, so the next-oldest transfer into the loan is PROMOTED;
* UNARCHIVE puts a definition back -- standing again, or newly when it is
  older than the live payment, since the seam names the oldest active one;
* the transfer UPDATE door re-points the standing payment's cadence, and a
  unit change (every paycheck to monthly) would otherwise store a payday as
  the monthly day.

**A moved definition's ROWS follow its rule** (developer 2026-09-13, after
this leaf's adversarial review): where the sync moved a start, the transfer
maintain pass runs for that definition from today, so a promoted or restored
transfer's rows sit on the contract's dates and never beside them.

The one refusal is the window CHECK's: a promoted or restored definition
whose owner-authored stop the re-derived start would pass refuses the door
WHOLE, naming the transfer, and writes nothing.  Every case here reads the
stored rule back and, for the refusals, the door's every other effect too
(a refusal that flashed and archived anyway would pass a status check).

The same dates as the sibling modules: a mortgage originating 2026-04-15,
payment day 1, first installment 2026-05-01; today frozen ahead of both
inside the schedule ``seed_periods`` builds (2026-01-02 .. 2026-05-21).

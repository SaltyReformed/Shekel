"""A stop stated at CREATE for a loan whose payment this would be is refused.

Plan step **R7d-f-3**, ruling **R-R60**.  The generic transfer form offers
every active account as a destination, so a loan's recurring payment can be
created there -- and until this step the form accepted a closing bound for it
that the next loan edit silently overwrote with the payoff, while the composed
door read the stored date as the chokepoints' cache from the start (plan
ledger row **N-512**).  The edit form has refused such a bound since plan step
R7b-4 (``LOAN_PAYMENT_BOUND_IS_DERIVED``); this is the create door's half,
landed beside ``settle_first_occurrence`` (in ``_loan_destination`` since plan
step R7d-f-5) because the route module stands at pylint's line cap.

**What "stated" means at create is a REAL stop -- a date or a count -- and
not the key's presence** (developer ruling 2026-09-12).  The create form's
server render cannot lock the "Ends" control, so it emits the select enabled
with "Never" preselected and an ordinary browser posts ``never`` unless the
script's lock ran; refusing on presence would make the script the control,
which ruling **R-R60** demotes to an affordance.  Two cases here pin that
reading, and their docstrings say what a presence rule would do to them.

**Re-cut at plan step R7d-g-2 under ruling R-R81**: the door derives the
start ONLY where the loan holds no active payment; a SECOND transfer's start
is its owner's -- required, and refused at or before the loan's origination
-- and its stop its owner's.  The second-transfer case and the affordance's
cases moved with that ruling and say so.

Every refusal case asserts that NOTHING was persisted, and every acceptance
case reads the stored bound back: a door that flashed the right sentence and
saved anyway, or saved a bound other than the one posted, would pass a
status-code assertion.  The browser's half -- that the row actually locks --
is ``tests/manual/verify_recurrence_form.py``'s, because rendered HTML cannot
tell a control a script disabled from one it never touched.

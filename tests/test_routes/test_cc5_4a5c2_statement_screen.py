"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5`` leaf 5c-2a: the statement screen says what it withholds.

Ruling **R-CC137** (developer 2026-10-04, "Only Paid from, say why"), graded
through the statement screen's own routes: *"Checking's statement screen
does not offer Hotel while its payment is recorded on the Visa (the reconcile
panel's test, R-CC126), and says so on that screen ... Doing that marks Hotel
Paid on Checking dated today; Checking's screen then offers its payment ... A
bill's payment then changes account only through 'Paid from' ... and a match
from a page drawn before the payment moved is refused."*  What the screen
SAYS is ruling **R-CC140** (the same day, "Short", replacing R-CC137's
sentence), at the figure ruling **R-CC139** names (*"Don't display $120 if
the bill is $135."*).  The service-level half (the offer set, the refused
accept on Checking, the accept on the card) is
``test_cc5_3_settle_tender::TestTheRowsClearingLinkStaysOnTheRowsAccount
::test_the_matcher_never_moves_a_card_payment``.

Every figure here is a made-up example.

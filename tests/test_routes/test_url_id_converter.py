its ``to_python`` was a bare ``int()``, so before :mod:`app.url_converters`

finding N-136 closed for form bodies: one row id under many spellings, and an
unhandled ``ValueError`` on a long enough digit run.

place it is graded**, because it raised inside ``url_adapter.match()`` --

any session -- so no route test could reach it and no authentication was
needed to trigger it.  Werkzeug 3.1.9 closed that arm in its own converter

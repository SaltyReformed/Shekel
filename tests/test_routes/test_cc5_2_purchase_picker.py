"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-2``, the GRID half: the picker, the name, the chip.

The purchase door took an account of its own in the first half of this step
(``tests/test_services/test_cc5_2_purchase_account_door.py``).  This module
grades the SURFACE that writes it and the surfaces that read it:

* the add-purchase form's **account picker** renders from the door's own
  tuple (:func:`app.services.cash_flow_set.purchase_accounts`, ruling
  **R-CC37**) on every surface that draws an envelope's entry list -- the
  grid's inline mobile card, the HTMX refresh, the companion page and the
  mobile-card fragment -- and only when there is a choice (ruling
  **R-CC34**);
* the entry list **names the account** a purchase moved through when it is
  not the row's own (ruling **R-CC15**);
* the **account chip** on the desktop cell and the mobile card is ONE rule
  over the row and its movements, less the balance line's account
  (``account_chips`` in ``grid/_grid_row_macros.html``), so a card swipe in
  a checking envelope chips the card from checking's grid and nothing extra
  from the card's;
* the chip's account read costs **no query** for a movement on a member of
  the owner's set, measured, so the grid's row query gains no eager load.

Every surface test plants the same world: the owner's checking account, one
card, one checking envelope in today's paycheck.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- The grid draws a transfer as a LEG read off its parent.

Plan step **balance:X-bi-6-1**, rulings **R-BAL86** (the decomposition) and
**R-BAL87** (the leg's identity).  Until this leaf the grid loaded a
transfer's two SHADOW rows in ``budget.transactions`` and drew each as an
ordinary cell whose doors were the transaction routes; now it loads the set's
OWN rows plus one :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` per
transfer it shows, keyed ``(transfer id, account id)``, priced by the leg map
producers and drawn by the same cell partial, and the cell's doors are the
transfer's own routes carrying ``leg_account_id``.

**What each control here grades, and why it is a control rather than a
reading.**  The byte-identity harness (``tests/manual/verify_grid_cells.py``)
proved the leaf moved no cell's words on the production restore; it cannot
show WHICH relation a cell was drawn from, because on that data the shadow's
stored name and the endpoints' names agree.  So the first case below is the
one the design's own sentence names -- a leg's label follows an account
RENAME, where a shadow's stored ``name`` went stale -- and it fails on the
shadow-reading grid by construction.  The rest grade the states the restore
does not exercise in the default window (a settled leg's recorded figure, a
reverted leg's retained figure, the mobile-card arm of the transfer door) and
the refusals (a leg on neither endpoint).

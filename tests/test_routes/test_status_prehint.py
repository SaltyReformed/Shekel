"""
Shekel Budget App -- Action-card status-dropdown pre-hint tests.

Grid audit D2 (ruled 2026-07-11, both halves): besides the designed
error fragments, the action cards' status dropdowns disable options the
state machine would reject from the row's CURRENT status, so an illegal
transition cannot be picked instead of failing after Save.  These tests
pin the disabled-option rendering per card; the legality table itself is
covered by ``tests/test_services/test_state_machine.py``.

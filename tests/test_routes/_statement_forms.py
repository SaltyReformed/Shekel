"""What a BROWSER would submit from a statement form, read off the page itself.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-2`` moved this out of
``test_statement_matches.py`` so the merchant-rule control's two surfaces could
share one reader.

**A browser submits every control it renders, at the value it renders**, and
that is the fact a hand-written payload cannot check: it is written by the same
person as the template, so the two agree about a mistake as readily as about
the truth.  This arc has paid for that twice -- a hand-picked subset shipped a
destination arm that was DEAD in a browser at plan step X-f6a-3b, found by
three adversarial reviews.

**IT IS ALL READERS NOW.**  It carried payload BUILDERS too -- ``match_item``,
``hand_match``, ``record_line``, ``rule_item`` and ``one_pass`` -- which spelled
the field names the review queue's and the workbench's forms emitted.  Plan
step ``bank_import:X-gi-2`` deleted both pages and the three test modules that
called them, leaving every one of those five with no caller, so they went in
the same commit rather than being left as a shape a later author would copy.
The Reconcile page is scraped rather than spelled
(:class:`ReconcileFormReader`), which is the stronger form of the same rule.

    **It keeps REPEATED names**, unlike :class:`RuleFormReader`: ``ok`` is
    rendered once per OK'd card and ``rows-<line>`` once per member row, and a
    group is exactly where a multi-value defect hides.

    **An unticked checkbox and an unchecked radio contribute NOTHING**, which
    is the whole of what makes ruling **R-HS**'s *an untouched card is not
    submitted* structural rather than a default: a page rendered with no card
    OK'd posts no ``ok`` at all, so no act can be built from it.

    **A ``disabled`` control is dropped too**, which the consent box depends
    on: the MATCH pane renders it ``value=""`` and ``disabled`` in lockstep
    until the server has a figure, so a browser cannot send an empty consent.

    **It also records what a browser COULD submit, not only what it would.**

    :func:`~tests.test_routes.test_statement_reconcile._post` refuses a
    payload against, and it exists because of a defect a green suite hid:
    every acting case appended ``("ok", str(line.id))`` by hand, and the
    ``ok-<line>`` checkbox is rendered only for a card that suggests a working
    verb -- so 31 of the developer's 248 cards had a panel button pointing at
    an element not in the document, and no test could see it because the
    tests posted a value no browser could produce.

    **The pair and not the name**: ``ok`` is ONE name shared by every card,
    keyed by its VALUE, so a check that only asked whether the page renders
    ``ok`` anywhere would pass the very payload that hid the defect.

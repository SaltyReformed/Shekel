"""The bank feed panel's four doors, driven the way a browser drives them.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-2``, leaf (3c); rulings **R-BI12**, **R-BI26**,
**R-BI27**, **R-BI28**; ledger row **BI-499**.  Bridge is a fake at
``requests.post`` / ``requests.get`` (the service tests' spy, shared, behind
the same net: every fake URL names Bridge's real host because the pin admits
no other, so an unstubbed request fails at ``Session.send`` rather than
leaving), and every form is POSTED AS THE PANEL RENDERS IT: the controls are
scraped off the rendered panel with
:func:`tests.test_routes._statement_forms.form_fields`, because a
hand-written payload agrees with a template about a mistake as readily as
about the truth.

**The claims these tests grade that the code's own words cannot:**

* **the claim commits BEFORE the listing** (R-BI27): the failing-fetch
  control connects a feed whose listing then fails, and the feed row is
  COMMITTED, the mappings empty, and the panel offers the press again;
* **every refusal is logged with its class** (BI-499): each refused door
  leaves a ``statement_door_refused`` record naming the class;
* **the credential never reaches a record or a body**: with Bridge's
  ``HTTPError`` text carrying the access URL's password, every captured
  record and every response body is asserted free of it;
* **the doors are the OWNER's and answer on the page they were pressed
  on**: a companion is 404, another owner's page is 404, a loan's page is
  404 -- and each success case proves the URL still routes, so an
  ownership 404 cannot be a URL-map 404 in disguise.

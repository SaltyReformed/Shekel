"""The no-baseline policy, graded across EVERY route the app registers.

Plan step X-v1, rulings R-BW and R-CB.  Every balance the app produces is
scoped to a baseline scenario, so a user without one has no balance any surface
can answer.  The seam raises one named exception
(:class:`app.exceptions.BaselineMissingError`) and one application-level handler
answers it: the setup-recovery page for a full request, ``204 No Content`` for
an HTMX request, an ERROR log event either way.

**Why this suite enumerates ``url_map`` instead of listing routes.**  The
defect it exists to catch was found that way and could not have been found any
other way.  Finding N-112 counted the sites that STATE the no-baseline rule --
13 of them, in six modules.  The three surfaces that 500'd
(``routes/loan/_helpers._load_route_context``,
``home_equity_service.resolve_home_equity``,
``debt_strategy._load_debt_accounts``, reached by 8 endpoints between them)
state it nowhere at all, so no search for a predicate could reach them.  A
route added a year from now is graded here without its author knowing this rule
exists, which is the property the rejected ``@require_baseline`` decorator
could not have had.

**What it does NOT prove**, stated because a gate that reads as proving more
than it does is this arc's most expensive recurring lesson:

* it cannot see a route that answers with a **fabricated figure**.  A ``$0.00``
  hero over balances that are all ``None`` returns 200 and passes every arm
  here, and so did a balance sheet asserting ``in_balance`` over a ledger it
  could not read -- which is exactly how X-v1's first draft of this file
  graded that page green.  Both were deleted at plan step X-v2 rather than
  gated, because there is no mechanical predicate for "this number is
  invented";
* it grades **GET** routes.  Two of the eight endpoints the census measured are
  POSTs, and they stay outside the sweep (ruling R-CB); the mutating-request
  contract is pinned by :class:`TestTheHandlerItself` instead;
* it proves nothing about surfaces that resolve the baseline WITHOUT the
  balance seam.  Fifteen such sites remain in ``app/`` -- forms, template
  generation, posting sync -- and they are finding **N-117**, owned by plan
  step **X-y**.  One of them is inside the sweep and answers 400 with a bare
  text body rather than the policy's card (``carry_forward_preview``); the
  sweep is green on it because 400 is under 500, which is the limit of what it
  claims;
* it grades ONE row of each kind, in the state the world builds it.  Whether
  the STATE matters was measured rather than assumed (2026-08-30): the four
  transaction doors, the three transfer doors and the transaction-template
  door were re-run against a SETTLED transaction, a settled transfer and an
  envelope transaction carrying an entry, and all twelve answered 200 exactly
  as the projected rows do.  A door whose answer turns on a row's status is
  therefore not something this file has evidence of, and a future one would
  need its own axis the way ``_ACCOUNT_KINDS`` is one;
* it cannot see a fill that names the WRONG KIND of row, **for eight of the
  eleven pairs**.  Measured 2026-08-30: eight fill from the first row of their
  own table, id 1, so handing the ``/transfers`` edit door the transaction
  template's id emits the byte-identical ``/transfers/1/edit`` -- a valid URL
  for a real row, 200, indistinguishable from the right one, and two mutations
  of that shape survived as an unobservable change must.  The three
  ``period_id`` pairs are the exception and were nearly stated wrong:
  ``period`` is ``periods[4]``, **id 6**, because ``build_seed_user`` writes a
  bootstrap period first and ``build_periods_today`` drops it -- so a swap
  involving one of those WOULD 404 and would be caught.  What stands in the
  other eight is
  :data:`_CONVERTER_ROWS` being TOTAL over ``(blueprint, name)`` with no
  fallback, so the mistake has to be WRITTEN DOWN rather than defaulted into.

**Every GET route is graded, and that is CHECKED** (plan step balance:X-be-3,
finding **N-388**).  Until it shipped, a rule whose converter the fixture could
not fill was skipped and pinned in a hand-maintained ``_UNREACHED_RULES``
allowlist -- seventeen of the app's 97 GET rules, 17.5%, graded by nobody
since the sweep was written, and the coverage test asserted the list rather
than closing it.  The world now holds a row of every kind a GET rule takes an
id for, there is no skip branch, and the coverage claim is an equality against
``url_map`` that no list can satisfy.

**None of the seventeen 5xx'd, and that is a claim about FIFTEEN of them.**
Two are the retired ``/salary/<id>/breakdown`` stubs, which redirect into the
cockpit on both request shapes and so reach no producer to crash in; the other
fifteen render.  An adversarial review caught the first draft of this sentence
counting all seventeen (2026-08-30).  Nothing goes ungraded by it -- the arm on
each case now resolves a redirect one hop through ``url_map`` and refuses one
landing outside the swept set -- but the answer N-388 asked for is fifteen
routes wide, not seventeen.

#: plan step balance:X-be-3 (finding **N-388**).  Seventeen GET rules -- 17.5%
#: of the app's 97 -- were pinned in that list and graded by NOBODY: a rule
#: whose converter the fixture could not fill was skipped, and the sweep's own
#: coverage test asserted the skip list rather than closing it, so the gap was
#: pinned rather than measured away.
#:
#: **There is no skip branch now.**  A rule carrying a pair absent from this
#: map turns the coverage test red and its own case red, so the only repair
#: available is to build the row, never to widen a list of exclusions.
#:
#: **A URL variable's identity is ``(blueprint, name)``, and this key is that
#: pair with no fallback to the bare name.**  Flask scopes a variable to its
#: view and the app uses that scope: censused 2026-08-30 over all 218 rules,
#: FIVE names are bound under more than one blueprint, and two of the five name
#: more than one TABLE -- ``template_id`` is a transaction template under
#: ``templates`` and a transfer template under ``transfers``, and
#: ``version_id`` is an escrow component version under ``loan`` where it is a
#: template amount version under the other two.  ``version_id``'s four rules
#: are POST-only today, so it is invisible here; a bare-name key with a
#: fallback would have filled the first GET among them from whichever table
#: was written down first, and eight of the eleven rows this world hands out
#: carry id 1, so that fill would have produced a VALID URL for the wrong row
#: and passed.  A total map cannot express that mistake without an author
#: writing the wrong pair down.
#:
#: **What this map cannot check is that a VALUE is right**, for the eight
#: pairs whose row is the first of its table: with both ids at 1, filling
#: ``("transfers", "template_id")`` from the transaction template emits the
#: byte-identical ``/transfers/1/edit``.  The three ``period_id`` pairs are not
#: in that eight -- ``period`` is id 6 -- so a swap involving one is caught.
#: The two doors reading two different tables is graded on the doors, in each
#: blueprint's own ``TestTemplateUpdate::test_edit_template_form`` --
#: ``tests/test_routes/test_templates.py`` and ``test_transfers.py``.  **The
#: two are not equally strong and the difference was measured** (2026-08-30):
#: the transfers one asserts ``b"Monthly Savings"``, which only its own row
#: supplies, while the templates one asserts ``b"Rent"``, which its fixture
#: uses for BOTH the template's name and its category -- and the category
#: ``<option>`` renders that string whatever the template is called.  What the
#: templates side really pins is that the door resolves a row in
#: ``transaction_templates`` at all: repointing it at ``transfer_templates``
#: 404s there, since that test creates none.

    world still gets its own private clone of that snapshot, so per-test
    isolation is exactly what it was.  Once per WORKER, not once per run: the
    253 cases scatter across ``-n 12``, so the world is built up to twelve
    times a session rather than 253 times a worker.

    As a per-test fixture this cost 302 ms of setup for 22 ms of requests,
    236 times over; the file went 82.26 s -> 18.73 s serially.  The full split,

    the assignment in silence and the control exercised nothing.  The link here

    It returns IDS and no ORM objects, which the seam requires: the dict is

    **The claim is "this case reached a producer", not "this row exists".**
    404 is under 500, so a case naming a row that is not there passes every
    other arm while measuring nothing -- which is N-388's own defect, one layer
    down.  A 404 from the URL map and a 404 a handler chose are
    indistinguishable, so this cannot say WHICH; the failure message offers
    both branches and the reader picks.

    Proved by mutation 2026-08-30, and it is the only arm that catches either:
    dropping the transfer from the world reddened its three doors, and adding
    100000 to the transaction's id reddened its four, both still green with
    this arm alone removed.  **It does not catch a fill naming the WRONG row**,
    and for eight of the eleven pairs no arm here could: those rows are each
    the first of their own table, id 1, so a swap between two of them emits a
    byte-identical URL.  ``period`` is id 6 and is the exception.  That limit
    is :data:`_CONVERTER_ROWS`'s to state and it does.

    TWO exclusions, both measured rather than assumed (2026-08-30, over the
    whole sweep):

    * an ``account_id`` rule, because a 404 is its DESIGN -- the kind axis
      deliberately requests the loan doors with a checking id, and 67 of the
      182 account cases answer 404 on one shape or the other.  Deleting this
      clause reddens all 67, which is the mutation that keeps it from being
      decorative;
    * a rule carrying NO converter, because such a route is addressed by its
      QUERY STRING and this predicate cannot see one.  The three that 404 today
      are the empty-cell family (``/transactions/empty-cell``, ``/new/full``,
      ``/new/quick``), whose coordinate is four ``request.args`` ids
      (``forms._resolve_grid_cell``); with none supplied the 404 is the correct
      answer, not a missing row.  The 19 rules left are exactly the ones this
      world addresses by id, and none answers 404 on either shape.

    Args:
        rule: The rule string, converters and all.

def _route_table_app():
    """A Flask app carrying the route table and NOTHING else.

    **Why not ``create_app``.**  The table this sweep needs is settled by
    blueprint registration, but ``create_app`` under the testing config also
    ensures schemas, seeds ``ref.*`` and populates ``ref_cache``
    (`app/__init__.py:159-162` and the `ref_cache.init` at `:207`) -- 151 SQL
    statements over 3 connections including 5 ``CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS``,
    measured 2026-08-29.  That work is orthogonal to ``url_map`` and it would
    run at COLLECTION here, where a database failure is a collection ERROR:
    under xdist a collection that DIFFERS BETWEEN WORKERS aborts the whole run
    rather than failing one test.  The two are not the same event and the
    difference matters: a uniform outage errors this file and lets the rest of
    the suite finish, while an INTERMITTENT one -- the shape two concurrent
    runs produce here -- aborts everything.  Seen once, 2026-08-29, against a
    DRAFT of this design that did build through ``create_app``:
    ``Different tests were collected between gw8 and gw3``, no test run.  It
    also reconfigures logging process-wide.

    **What this design costs in exchange, stated because it is not free.**  At
    HEAD the parametrize list was a constant tuple, so collection COULD NOT
    differ between workers whatever happened.  It is now derived, once per
    worker, from an app built at import: nothing in `_register_blueprints` is
    non-deterministic today, but the failure mode is no longer structurally
    impossible, and its blast radius is the suite rather than this file.

    ``register_url_converters`` is called FIRST because `create_app` documents
    that order as required (`app/__init__.py:136`): a rule naming a converter
    this app has not registered raises ``LookupError`` at import, which is that
    same collection error arriving by another door.

    Measured 2026-08-29, this table and ``create_app("testing")``'s are
    IDENTICAL -- 218 rules, equal on endpoint, rule and methods.  `create_app`
    adds no route of its own (no ``add_url_rule``, no ``@app.route``).

    **The identity is asserted for the GET routes this sweep grades, not
    assumed**: the coverage test compares this table against the one the
    FIXTURE's app serves.  A non-GET route registered outside a blueprint would
    not be covered by that comparison.

    Registering the blueprints here also marks each one registered-once in this
    process before any test runs.  Nothing in `app/` uses ``record_once`` today,
    so this is inert; a blueprint that grew one would have it consumed here.

    Returns:
        A Flask app whose ``url_map`` is the application's.

#: **Every route is its OWN test.**  This is the whole of the wall-clock fix,
#: and it replaces a hand-cut partition rather than resizing one.
#:
#: As ONE test the sweep made 388 requests (194 concrete URLs, each in both
#: request shapes) inside pytest-timeout's 30 s, which covers setup, call and
#: teardown together.  On 2026-08-16 it crossed: `test_no_get_route_returns_5xx`
#: timed out on four of nine CI runs.  Removing the cluster cost that made CI
#: slow (PR #106) bought headroom and did not remove the shape -- the measured
#: call was still 24.68 s against 30 s.
#:
#: **Splitting it into arms did not remove the shape either, whatever the arms
#: were named.**  One test issuing every request is O(the route table) under a
#: budget that is O(1) per test, and an arm only divides the constant: by
#: account KIND (`910065a9`) the largest arm still grew, and re-measured
#: 2026-08-29, eleven days later, the account-less arm was still exactly 54 URLs
#: while every one of the 42 URLs the table had gained sat in the KIND arms,
#: which grew 20 -> 26 each.  A kind axis cannot bound that by construction: one
#: new account route adds a URL to ALL SEVEN kind arms at once.  Finding
#: **N-364** reads the growth the other way round.  (An earlier draft cited a
#: 35 -> 41 census of ``<int:account_id>`` decorators as corroboration.  That
#: was an ARTIFACT: the grep only counted occurrences sharing a line with
#: ``.route(``, and 22 of today's 63 sit on continuation lines -- the true
#: count is 48 -> 63.  The +6 that matters is the GET rules per kind, 20 -> 26,
#: measured directly off ``url_map``.)
#:
#: One case per test makes the per-test cost O(1) in the route table: two
#: requests, whatever the app grows into.  Nothing here has a size to keep in
#: step, and pytest-timeout's 30 s goes back to being the hang detector
#: `pytest.ini` calibrated it as.  Measured CI-shaped (4 cores, ``-n 12``,
#: 2026-08-29): the largest single arm read 2.16 s split by account kind, and
#: no case's CALL reaches a `--durations` report ahead of this file's own
#: setup entries -- a case's two requests are a 0.020 s median.
#:
#: **What it costs, and where that cost actually lives.**  Measured serially
#: 2026-08-29, 252 items in 81.16 s: per-item SETUP is **87%** of that (236
#: sweep items, 0.270 s median, 70.49 s) and the requests the sweep exists to
#: make are **7%** (0.020 s median, 5.39 s).  **The item count has since moved
#: to 253** -- `balance:X-be-3` widened the world and the 17 rules it could not
#: reach became cases -- so the ratios above are the ones to carry forward and
#: the absolute seconds are not.
#:
#: That 0.270 s splits, on matched serial probes of 30 items each the same day:
#: **0.160 s (59%) is this module's own seven-account fixture** and 0.110 s
#: (41%) is the per-test chain it inherits, whose floor is the autouse ``db``
#: fixture dropping and re-cloning the per-worker database.  Two earlier
#: readings of this file blamed the clone for the whole of it; both were
#: confounded -- one divided an xdist wall clock by an item count, charging the
#: fixed worker bootstrap to the items, and one compared against items that
#: turned out to use the same fixture.
#:
#: **The sweep is READ-ONLY -- every request here is a GET -- so it buys none
#: of that isolation.**  Paying once instead of 236 times is finding
#: **N-387**, owned by **X-be-2**, and the split above is what that step is
#: sized against: sharing a database alone recovers the 41%, so the shared
#: state has to carry the seven accounts too.  It is not done here, and the
#: obvious remedy is measured WRONG: a module-scoped clone is re-cloned out
#: from under this module by the next test from ANY other module landing on the
#: same worker, observed on three workers under ``-n 12`` (2026-08-29).
#:
#: Building an app at import is what a per-route test id costs -- ids are fixed
#: before any fixture runs -- but it costs no DATABASE: see
#: :func:`_route_table_app`, which registers the blueprints onto a bare Flask
#: app rather than calling ``create_app``.

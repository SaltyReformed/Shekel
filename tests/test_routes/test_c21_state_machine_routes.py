"""
Shekel Budget App -- C-21 Route-Level State Machine Tests

PATCH /transactions/<id> and the transfer service status path both
funnel through ``app.services.state_machine.verify_transition``.
These tests exercise the route layer's translation of an illegal
transition into a 400 -- and confirm that legal transitions still
produce the cell-render 200 the HTMX UI depends on.

The same PATCH route also enforces the finalised-row field-edit lock
(``finalised_edit_rejection``, #26): money / period / category /
due-date edits are refused on a finalised row unless the same request
reverts it to Projected.  ``TestPatchRejectsFinalisedFieldEdit`` /
``TestPatchAllowsEditableField`` cover that policy at the route layer.

Audit reference: F-046 / F-047 / F-161 / commit C-21 of the
2026-04-15 security remediation plan.

"""Ruling R-FO end to end: a true-up's counter leg says what the difference WAS.

Balance arc, plan step **X-f3d**.  A non-loan account's balance assertion posts
a balanced two-leg correction, and until this step BOTH legs' destinations were
fixed: the account's linked ledger, and its equity row.  For a Roth IRA or a
Property that second leg is wrong -- the difference is investment return -- and
booking it to equity is why ``$10,653.91`` of return earned over 4.5 months was
invisible on the income statement (measured on a production clone 2026-08-13).

What these cases pin, and each is a thing that could ship wrong on its own:

* the DISPATCH -- an ``INTEREST`` account's true-up books to Interest Income,
  an ``INVESTMENT`` / ``APPRECIATING`` account's to Change in Value, and
  a ``PLAIN`` account's stays on equity (unchanged, so the cutover X-f3c owns
  it);
* the OPENING -- which books to equity for EVERY kind, because capital brought
  onto the books is not something earned;
* BALANCE NEUTRALITY -- the linked leg, and therefore every balance the app
  reports for the account, is byte-identical either side of the ruling;
* the SELF-MIGRATION -- an account whose true-up is already posted against
  equity re-points on the next sync, with no backfill, as one balanced delta;
* the STATEMENTS -- the income statement reports the gain BELOW net income and
  the balance sheet still ties out, which are the two ways this change could
  have gone silently wrong (counted as earnings, or left out of equity).

The oracle is deliberately independent of the writer: every assertion reads
``budget.account_postings`` back through test-authored queries, and the
statement cases read the public report functions rather than the chart.

        have too -- the value-change row growing without bound, equity
        shrinking to match, and the linked ledger and the trial balance both
        perfectly correct the whole way, so nothing else would have said a word.

Integration test for the Section 5.1 loan payment pipeline.

Verifies the end-to-end flow: recurring transfer creation via the loan
dashboard route -> transfer generation -> payment history query ->
amortization engine projection -> balance calculator.

It also verified the transfer invariants over each transfer's two shadow
rows until plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` made a transfer one row
(ruling **R-BAL258**): what they kept equal has one home now, and the
generated transfers are read directly.

            # version passed only because the producer was wrong in the

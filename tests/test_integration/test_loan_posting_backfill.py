"""Tests for the Build-Order Step 4 historical loan-payment split backfill (Commit 6).

Commit 6 posts one balanced CORRECTION per confirmed post-anchor settled loan
payment that predates the Commit-5 go-forward wiring, so the ledger is complete
on real historical data.  Because the loan split is a running-balance walk over
rate periods and effective-dated escrow -- not a one-line SQL formula -- the
backfill cannot be raw SQL like the Step-2 / Step-3 cash backfills; it reuses the
go-forward per-loan sync (:func:`loan_posting_service.sync_loan_payment_postings_all_scenarios`)
so a backfilled correction is IDENTICAL to a go-forward one by construction.  It
therefore does not run inside the Alembic migration (the migration host has no
``ref_cache``); it runs in the post-migration deploy hook
(``scripts/init_database.py``) and is exercised here through the app-layer entry
point :func:`loan_posting_service.backfill_all_loan_payment_postings`.

Manufacturing the "historical" state: post-Commit-5, settling a loan payment
through ``transfer_service`` auto-posts its correction.  To reproduce a payment
settled BEFORE the wiring existed (which carries no correction), each test
settles the payment, then clears the corrections with the migration's own raw-SQL
teardown (:func:`_MIGRATION._remove_loan_payment_postings`) -- exactly the
pre-Commit-5 state -- and asserts the backfill restores them.

The split fixtures are SYNTHETIC with HAND-COMPUTED literals: a $100,000 balance
at 6% gives a clean $500.00 first-month interest (``100000 * 0.06 / 12``).  The
trueup anchor ($100,000) is deliberately distinct from origination ($250,000), so
a correct interest figure also proves the walk seeds from the latest anchor, not
origination.  All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

The migration's executable downgrade/upgrade round-trip through Alembic runs
cleanly (verified on the freshly-built template); the downgrade's data removal is
checked behaviorally here (``_remove_loan_payment_postings`` is DELETE-based, so it
runs on the shared test session) plus a source-level guard, and the with-data
prod-clone round-trip is the Commit-7 manual step.  The deploy hook that runs the
backfill in production (``scripts/init_database.py``) is covered by a
commit-contract test that observes the persisted correction from a separate
database connection (a mere flush would be invisible to it).

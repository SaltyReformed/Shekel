"""Tests for the Build-Order Step 5 historical account anchor-posting backfill (C7).

Commit C7 posts every NON-loan account's opening / true-up anchor corrections
that predate the C6 go-forward wiring, so the ledger is complete on real
historical data and the trial balance closes app-wide.  Because an anchor
correction is a DAY-granular walk of the account's assertions against its
linked ledger -- not a one-line SQL formula -- the backfill cannot be raw SQL
like the Step-2 / Step-3 cash backfills; it reuses the go-forward per-account
sync (:func:`account_posting_service.sync_account_anchor_postings_all_scenarios`)
so a backfilled correction is IDENTICAL to a go-forward one by construction.  It
therefore does not run inside the Alembic migration (the migration host has no
``ref_cache``); it runs in the post-migration deploy hook
(``scripts/init_database.py``) and is exercised here through the app-layer entry
point :func:`account_posting_service.backfill_all_account_anchor_postings`.

Manufacturing the "historical" state: post-C6, creating an account (or truing up
its anchor) auto-posts its correction.  To reproduce an account whose opening was
asserted BEFORE the wiring existed (which carries no correction), each test
creates the account, then clears its corrections with the boundary migration's
own raw-SQL teardown (:func:`_MIGRATION._remove_account_anchor_postings`) --
exactly the pre-C6 state -- and asserts the backfill restores them.

The migration's executable downgrade/upgrade round-trip through Alembic runs
cleanly (verified on the freshly-built template); the downgrade's data removal is
checked behaviorally here (``_remove_account_anchor_postings`` is DELETE-based, so
it runs on the shared test session) plus a source-level guard.  The deploy hook
that runs the backfill in production
(``scripts/init_database.py``) is covered by a commit-contract test that observes
the persisted correction from a separate database connection (a mere flush would
be invisible to it).

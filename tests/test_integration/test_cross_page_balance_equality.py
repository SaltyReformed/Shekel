Shekel Budget App -- Cross-Page Balance Equality Lock (HIGH-01, Commit 11)

The single regression test the developer's two worst reported symptoms
lacked.  Symptom #1 ($160 on the grid vs $114.29 on /savings for the
same Projected envelope expense with cleared entries) and symptom #5
(/accounts matches nowhere) had zero falsifying coverage before this
commit: the three audit-plan-mandated cross-page-equality greps over
the pre-commit ``tests/`` tree returned exit-1 (zero matches), and the
near-miss ``test_checking_detail_matches_grid_balance`` recomputes its
own entries-absent balance instead of rendering a second page (it
passes against the divergent code).

This module's contract: for one Account / Scenario / pay-period
configuration with a Projected envelope expense carrying any
combination of cleared / uncleared / credit entries, every balance-
rendering surface MUST return the identical Decimal:

  1. Grid                    -- ``GET /grid`` + the seam's cash-flow entry
                                ``balance_at.cash_balance_map`` (the FOLD since
                                plan step X-c2b2).
  2. /savings                 -- ``savings_dashboard_service`` +
                                ``GET /savings``.
  3. /accounts cash detail    -- the balance ``GET /accounts/<id>/details``
                                renders, read off its ``data-current-balance``
                                hook (the L6 route-render lock: the ONE surface
                                verified against real route output, not a
                                re-call of the seam beneath it).
  4. Dashboard               -- ``dashboard_service.compute_balance_section``
                                (the pulse hero) + ``GET /dashboard``.
  5. Calendar month-end      -- ``calendar_service.get_month_detail``'s
                                ``projected_end_balance`` at the
                                calendar month-end of the anchor
                                period (the C9-3 boundary invariant
                                guarantees equality with the
                                resolver's anchor-period balance).

Five parameter cases lock the formula, not one number: the F-009
worked example (PT-01 base), zero anchor (E-12 "zero is a value"),
negative overdraft balance, credit-only entries (reservation zeroed
by a same-period credit), and uncleared-floor (the
``max(estimated - cleared_debit - sum_credit, uncleared_debit)``
floor that no cleared/credit drift can squeeze below).

The subtotal-reconciliation assertion
(:class:`TestSubtotalReconciliation`) closes Q-10 / E-25's same-formula
invariant on ruling R-K's basis: for one ``GridColumn`` per period,
``balance[p] - balance[p-1] == net[p] + reconciliation[p]`` to the penny, with
the remainder pinned per case as the fixture's own true-up.  When this fails the
grid's subtotal rows and balance row have re-grown the F-002 Pair C / F-004
same-page divergence (the inline ``sum(... effective_amount ...)`` loop the
pre-Commit-10 grid had).

The seam-injection negative-control test
``test_invariant_fails_if_seam_reintroduced`` proves the lock is
load-bearing, not a coincidence: monkey-patching one consumer to
bypass the balance-at seam and report ``effective_amount`` directly
makes the cross-page equality assertion fail, which is the failure
mode the developer needs to see in CI before a regression ships.

Test IDs are C11-1..C11-6 mapping to the remediation plan's
Commit 11 specification.

# ── C11-5: subtotal reconciles to balance delta on every page ──────


class TestSubtotalReconciliation:
    """The grid column's rows reconcile to its balance on every parameter case.

    E-25 / Q-10 / F-002 Pair C: ONE valued row set drives both the per-period
    subtotal rows and the balance row, so the period-to-period balance delta
    must equal the column's net plus ruling R-K's remainder plus the accrual, to
    the penny.  Before Commit 10 the grid's inline ``sum(...
    effective_amount ...)`` subtotal loop violated this whenever a
    Projected envelope expense carried cleared entries -- the subtotal
    row reported $500 while the balance row reflected the entries-aware
    $454.29 reduction.  This test fires the moment a future edit
    re-grows that divergence.

    **Read off ONE ``GridBalanceView`` since plan step X-c2b3.**  It differenced
    ``_cash_engine.balances_for`` against ``cash_ledger.period_subtotal``, and
    both deleted -- the balance replaced by the fold at X-c2b2, the subtotal by
    ``cash_period_view``, which is R-K's basis and carries the remainder term the
    old two-producer form had no name for.  The identity's SHAPE therefore
    changed with it: what a subtotal counts is no longer "the unpaid rows" but
    "every row attributed here", and what the balance counts is money that
    MOVED, so the two reconcile through a named remainder rather than exactly.

        reconcile the anchor period's column against its predecessor's, then the
        post-anchor period's against the anchor's.

        The post-anchor period carries NO transactions of its own, so its net is
        exactly zero and its balance equals the anchor period's -- the
        no-transaction reconciliation step, and the case that would catch a
        remainder quietly absorbing a mis-grouped row.

        **The anchor period's remainder is the fixture's own TRUE-UP, and

        untestable.**  ``seed_cross_page_account`` leaves the ``seed_user``
        factory's ``$1,000.00`` origination assertion in place and appends a
        SECOND one at the case's ``anchor_balance`` (latest-wins, E-19), both

        period, so the re-assertion's correction --
        ``anchor_balance - $1,000.00`` -- is money that moved through the column
        with no row to explain it: exactly what ruling R-K's Reconciliation row
        exists to show, here on five different anchor balances.  Asserting it as
        a computed figure rather than letting it fall out of the identity is
        Section 7.2's rule: a remainder read as a residual makes the identity
        arithmetically true, and would silently absorb a mis-grouped row.

        The POST-anchor period carries neither an assertion nor a row, so its
        remainder and its net are both exactly zero -- the case that would catch
        a remainder leaking forward.  A PLAIN account accrues nothing, asserted

    The boundary assertions additionally lock the balance rule at the three
    points a loan's per-period map is answered from, since each has a DIFFERENT
    producer and only one of them can see any given defect:

    * **A begun period at/after the true-up** (the anchor period) -- the confirmed
      LEDGER.  Returns C, never the original principal P.
    * **A begun period that ended BEFORE the true-up** -- the confirmed ledger
      again, which reports what it knew then: the $240,000 opening, since this loan
      has no recorded payment.  A re-anchored schedule must never back-project
      today's balance over a past it has no evidence for.
    * **The first FUTURE period** -- the forward PROJECTION, which amortizes DOWN
      from C, so it sits below C.  A map reporting the original principal here
      (one that fell back to the whole-schedule walk) would sit far above C.

    A note on what this test can NO LONGER catch, so nobody trusts it for more
    than it does.  Before the ledger read switch, EVERY period came from the
    schedule walk seeded with ``current_balance``, so a pre-payment period was a
    live probe of that seed -- which is what made it the PR #44 / aba0242 lock
    (that bug passed ``original_principal`` where the seed belongs).  Now the
    ledger owns every BEGUN period, and the seed is read only for a target
    preceding the first scheduled payment, so the seed is invisible to all three
    assertions above.  Confirmed by reintroducing the defect: seeding the forward
    projection with ``original_principal`` changes no value this test sees.  The
    fence on that argument is now STRUCTURAL, not this test: the forward seed is
    single-sourced from the opening anchor (never ``original_principal``) in
    ``net_worth_kernel._projection_seed``, so no call site passes the seed at all

    finding **N-83**, recorded and scheduled for its own commit alongside plan
    step X-e rather than fixed inside a money-moving cutover.

    naming the patched surface and the wrong value.  Without this a per-kind
    equality test that happened to read the same producer twice would still
    report green.  Parametrised over the three single-value kinds to stay
    DRY.

    **It fired whether or not the injection landed, and that is finding N-94**
    (repaired at plan step X-h).  It compared every surface against the
    fixture's ASSERTED value -- ``ctx["V"]`` / ``ctx["C"]`` -- and since plan
    step X-g2b gave the anchor period its own accrual (ruling R-Y) no modelled
    surface returns that number.  Measured on the fixtures at the repair:

    ======================  ==============  ==============  ================
    kind                    asserted        modelled        blind?

    name/value assertions then matched against the "All surface values: {...}"
    dump rather than against the lock actually biting -- the shape Section 7.3
    of the balance plan exists to prevent.

    Two things repair it.  The comparand is now the seam's own modelled
    current balance, read through :func:`_modelled_current_balance`, which is
    the identical oracle the sibling positive tests use -- so this control can
    never again drift from the figure those tests assert.  And each case
    carries the surfaces its positive test EXCLUDES: the property kind's
    ``property_detail`` still reads the cache column (finding N-83), so
    including it would leave the unpatched set non-uniform for a reason that
    has nothing to do with the injection.

    The control for the control is asserted in the test itself: the UNPATCHED
    set must pass before the patch is applied.  Without that premise a lock
    that fires for any reason reads exactly like a lock that fires for the

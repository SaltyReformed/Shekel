"""The R-SAL5 backfill picks the RIGHT salary profile, and refuses the wrong ones.

Plan step **salary:R14-a**, migration ``e7c4b9a2f350``.  The migration gives
``budget.investment_params`` a ``salary_profile_id`` -- which job's paycheck
funds this account's payroll feed -- and backfills it in two steps: the single
active same-owner profile whose active deduction names the account, else the
owner's single active profile, else NULL.

**Why these tests exist rather than the migration's hand measurement alone.**
Two defects in the first draft of that backfill were found by an adversarial
review and proven by running the pre-fix predicate against constructed data.
Both are the class a green suite is silent about BY CONSTRUCTION: the rows are
written, every constraint holds, and nothing raises until somebody reads a
figure that belongs to a job they left or to another person entirely.  The full
suite was green at 12,849 tests while both defects were live, so for these two
the suite was not an instrument -- it is one now.  A peer session working the
same shape put the standard well: the question is not "does the suite pass" but
"does a case exist that would have FAILED before the fix".  Each test below is
that case, and :class:`TestTheBackfillIsGraded` proves each one fires.

**The SQL is executed, not re-implemented.**  The tests import the migration
module and run its own ``_BACKFILL`` statement, so a test cannot pass against a
correct re-statement of a broken migration -- the tautology this repository's
lessons file records.

"""Structural gate: an out-of-band MOUNT is not inside a self-refreshing region.

Plan step X-f1e3, finding **N-199**.

**The defect this exists to make unrepeatable.**  The anchor true-up's
back-dated acknowledgement was swapped out-of-band into ``#anchor-as-of``, a
per-surface caption.  On the dashboard that caption lives inside
``#pulse-section``, which carries ``hx-trigger="balanceChanged from:body"`` --
and the true-up's own response fires ``HX-Trigger: balanceChanged``.  So the
message swapped in and was then destroyed by the region re-fetch its own
response had triggered, within one round-trip.  Three further surfaces carried
no such element at all and were skipped outright.  One of five worked.

**Why the existing test could not see it.**  It asserted the acknowledgement's
text was in the RESPONSE BODY.  It was -- on the dashboard it was in the body
and gone from the DOM a moment later.  A response-body assertion cannot observe
what a second request does to the page; only the MOUNT's position can be
checked without a browser, and that is what this file checks.  (Section 7's
"ask of every harness: can it SEE the code under test?", paid for again.)

**What is asserted.**  For a fragment that must SURVIVE the ``balanceChanged``
its own response fires, the mount must have no ancestor that re-fetches itself
on that event.  ``#anchor-ack-mount`` lives in ``base.html``, so this is a
property of the shared layout and is graded on every page that extends it.

**The negative control is REAL, not planted** (Section 7.3).  The dashboard's
``#anchor-as-of`` genuinely IS inside ``#pulse-section``, and correctly so:
it is a durable caption that the pulse re-render redraws from its own loader.
That makes it a permanent positive subject for the detector -- if the probe
stops reporting it, the probe has stopped working, and no mutation has to be
planted to find that out.

The probe walks the rendered HTML rather than reading templates, because the
ancestry that matters is composed across ``base.html``, the page template and
its includes -- no one file contains it.

**What this gate does NOT cover, stated so it is not over-trusted:**

* **Three of the five anchor-editor surfaces.** The investment detail and cash
  detail pages need an account fixture and are ungraded here.  Both extend
  ``base.html``, so the mount is present by construction, but the two pages
  most recently restructured are the two nobody checks.
* **Only an ANCESTOR's own ``hx-trigger``.** A SIBLING element whose
  ``hx-target`` points at an ancestor of the mount would destroy the toast just
  as effectively and is invisible to this probe.
* **Whether the toast is ever SHOWN.** The mount surviving is half the
  contract; ``.toast:not(.show){display:none}``, so the other half is
  ``data-toast-auto-show`` reaching ``app.js``'s handler.  That half is graded
  in ``tests/test_routes/test_accounts.py`` -- an adversarial review deleted
  the attribute and measured the ENTIRE suite still passing, which is how that
  assertion came to exist.

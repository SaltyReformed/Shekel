"""The posting-ledger reconciliation oracle (Build-Order Step 2, Commit 6).

This is the correctness gate for the double-entry posting ledger.  Reads stay
on the ``balance_at`` seam over ``budget.transactions`` (Step 2 changes no read
path), so the ledger is validated against the **settled-transfer subset** of
transactions rather than against full projected balances.  The invariants
below are exactly plan Section 6:

  1. **Per-account reconciliation** (asset AND liability legs): for each real
     account A, the net of A's posting legs equals the net effect of A's
     settled, non-deleted transfer shadows -- ``+effective`` for an income
     shadow (money in -> a debit), ``-effective`` for an expense shadow (money
     out -> a credit), where ``effective = COALESCE(actual, estimated)``.
  2. **Per-entry balance**: every journal entry's legs ``SUM(amount) = 0`` and
     ``COUNT(*) >= 2`` (also DB-enforced by ``ck_account_postings_balanced``).
  3. **Trial balance**: ``SUM(account_postings.amount) = 0`` across the whole
     ledger (follows from 2, asserted directly as a cheap self-check).
  4. **Multi-scenario isolation**: postings in scenario X never reconcile
     against transactions in scenario Y (the ``scenario_id`` denorm is honored).
  5. **Owner isolation via ``journal_entry.user_id``**: a posting carries no
     ``user_id`` of its own; its owner is reached only through its journal
     entry, and one owner's reconciliation never picks up another owner's
     postings.  (Plan Section 6 calls this the "companion-owner case".  A
     companion user cannot in fact OWN a transfer -- ``transfer_service``
     refuses any actor that does not own the from/to accounts, and a companion
     owns none -- so the property the plan actually names, ownership inherited
     via ``journal_entry.user_id``, is proven here with a second independent
     owner, which exercises the identical join.)

The oracle also holds over BOTH historical-backfilled postings (the raw-SQL
migration builder) and go-forward postings (the ``posting_service`` Python
builder): a dedicated case posts one transfer each way and asserts the two
producers agree leg-for-leg and reconcile identically.

**Non-tautological by construction.**  Each invariant is checked three
independent ways that must all agree:

  * **hand-computed literals** -- the expected ledger sums are the test
    author's arithmetic over the seeded transfer amounts (e.g. Checking sends
    $100 + $250, so its ledger MUST be exactly ``-350.00``), owing nothing to
    either producer or either service helper;
  * **independent cross-table reconciliation** -- the ledger side
    (``_independent_ledger_sum``) reads the ``account_postings`` table through a
    different join shape than ``account_posting_total``, and the transaction
    side (``_independent_txn_effect``) reads the ``transactions`` table;
    asserting the two equal reconciles what the producers WROTE against the
    transaction source of truth.  (The transaction side necessarily restates the
    one correct definition of the settled-shadow effect, so it mirrors
    ``settled_transfer_effect``'s semantics; the hand-computed literals, not this
    query, are what make the oracle non-tautological -- this layer adds the
    cross-table, whole-DB sweep the literals cannot.)
  * **the production service helpers** -- ``account_posting_total`` and
    ``settled_transfer_effect`` (the readers Steps 4-5 will switch balances
    onto) must match the hand-computed literals too.

Two adversarial cases prove the oracle is not vacuous: tampering a settled
shadow makes the per-account reconciliation FAIL -- driven through the real
``_assert_full_reconciliation`` sweep helper under ``pytest.raises``, so a
regression in the helper itself is caught, not only in an inline re-derivation
(so a real ledger drift would be caught) -- and injecting one extra leg makes the
trial balance go non-zero (so the ``= 0`` assertion is a real check, not one the
per-entry trigger makes unconditionally true).

All money is ``Decimal`` from strings, with the arithmetic shown per the
testing standard.  Transfers are built through ``transfer_service`` (the sole
writer), so every shadow obeys the transfer invariants exactly as production
produces them; Commit 5 wiring auto-posts each settle.

    Capture-on-settle (escrow redesign, Option A): the transfer's stored
    default is a deliberately stale $1.00, and the operator settles via the
    ``mark_done`` route WITHOUT typing an actual.  The frozen ``actual_amount``
    must be the live PITI (P&I 1,199.10 + escrow 300.00 = 1,499.10), NOT the
    $1.00 estimate -- so the settled cash carries exactly the escrow the genesis
    split subtracts (cash == split).  The split then divides 1,499.10 into
    interest 1,000.00 (200,000 * 0.06 / 12), escrow 300.00, and principal
    199.10 (= P&I 1,199.10 - interest 1,000.00).

    **The shadow's own ``estimated_amount`` was NULL, and that was the point
    of the cutover** (plan step X-au-g-2c-2).  It had held the generated
    ``$1.00`` and was deliberately left alone, because it was the base the
    deleted ``_manual_shadow_amount`` derived from -- so a settle that wrote
    it would have made the next settle derive from its own output (finding
    N-259's shape).  The column was empty on a derived row, so that hazard had
    no state to occur in, and what a PROJECTED shadow was worth was asked of
    the amount model rather than of the column; no shadow is born since plan
    step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3, and the paragraph below says what is asked now.

    After the settle, the transfer's status is the one status and each side's
    record holds the captured figure, where both were read off the twin rows
    (ruling R-BAL167 class 1, plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-2).

    **The payment is the first TRANSFER into the loan since plan step
    balance:X-bi-6-4d-3** (ruling R-BAL167 class 1), where it was the first
    loan-side shadow; it is priced through its leg on the loan.  The two "the
    PLAN column is empty" reads were the shadow's ``estimated_amount`` and the
    transfer's ``amount`` before the settle, and the shadow's after it: the
    one row left is the transfer, so both are its ``amount`` -- the same
    claim with nothing left to violate it.

    """Once a loan payment is paid, nothing that happens later moves what it paid.

    Designed from scratch by ruling **R-BAL284** (Josh, 2026-10-14), after
    rulings R-BAL276 and R-BAL283 each rested on a premise measured false.
    Its one question: once a mortgage payment is paid, can anything that
    happens LATER change what it paid?  Two later events are realistic: the
    plan changes, and "paid" is clicked again from an old tab.

    Checking holds 1,000.00.  The Feb 1 payment is paid through its leg's
    Mark Paid at P&I 1,199.10 + escrow 300.00 = **1,499.10**, so checking
    reads 1,000.00 - 1,499.10 = **-499.10**.  The owner then sets a standing
    extra principal of $100.00 a month through the payment-settings door.
    The extra has no date, so the unpaid payments now plan
    1,199.10 + 300.00 + 100.00 = **1,599.10**, and so does the paid one's
    own plan.  Then the Feb 1 leg's Mark Paid is posted again, as an old tab
    would post it.

    **Each check fails FIRST under its own one-point mutation of the app
    (measured at commit 1e778deea, whose body names each first-fail line
    at that commit):**

    * checking reads -499.10 after the pay, the starting point: it fails
      when the derive-mode price drops its escrow term
      (``_loan_installment``'s sum), so the pay books 1,199.10 and checking
      reads -199.10;
    * the UNPAID Mar 1 payment plans 1,599.10, so the change took: it fails
      when the derive-mode price drops the extra (``_loan_installment``'s
      P&I + escrow + extra sum) and when the settings door redirects
      without saving it;
    * the valuation the calendar's day cells index for a transfer leg
      (``cash_ledger.leg_contributions_by_key``), asked of the PAID Feb 1
      payment's leg on the loan, still reads 1,499.10: it fails when
      ``leg_contribution_of`` stops asking the record first
      (``leg_fixed_contribution`` skipped) and reads the plan's 1,599.10;
    * the repeat click is answered 200: it fails when the transfer
      workflow loses its ``done -> done`` identity edge and refuses the
      click;
    * checking still reads -499.10 after it: it fails when the repeat
      click is taken as a $0.00 close (``status_seam._side``'s
      ``withdraws`` without its ``settlement is not None`` term), which
      takes the paid 1,499.10 off the books and leaves checking at
      1,000.00.

    The other two acts' acceptance reads are graded the same way: the
    first click's 200 fails first when the transfer workflow loses its
    ``projected -> done`` edge and refuses the click (400), and the
    settings door's 302 when its definition gate never matches (404).

    The third check grades that shared valuation, not the calendar's use
    of it: the calendar draws the checking side's leg, and a swap at its
    call site (``calendar_service._contributions`` asking
    ``leg_amounts_by_key``) shows the paid payment there at 1,599.10 with
    this case green.  ``test_calendar_service``'s
    ``test_a_settled_leg_is_a_paid_cell_worth_its_record`` catches that
    swap.  The dashboard's bills load only transfers still projected, so a
    payment marked paid is not among them.

    **Left out, each measured:** checking, the loan's split and the record
    figure the grid's paid cell reads (``leg_settled_amounts_by_key``)
    right after the plan change, which none of the one-point mutations
    measured moves (each reads only the money that moved); the PAID
    payment's own planned figure (``leg_amounts_by_key``, the grid's budget
    map), which reads 1,599.10 beside its 1,499.10 record and is an open
    question of its own, not settled here; and the first guard itself
    (``enters_settled_band`` skipped, so a repeat click runs the settle act
    again), which alone changes nothing this case reads and is graded by
    ``test_transfer_settle_freeze``'s
    ``test_settling_an_ALREADY_settled_transfer_writes_nothing``.

    The payments are the TRANSFERS due 2026-02-01 and 2026-03-01, each read
    through its leg on the loan (plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3, ruling

        installment on/after it       -> 1,500.00 + 300.00 = 1,800.00

    Both figures must appear, and the split must fall on the recast date.  A
    fixture whose payments all landed on one side of the boundary would assert
    the same thing about a producer that read one clock, which is why the
    boundary itself is asserted rather than the figures alone.

    It prices the payments' legs, keyed by each leg's installment date, where
    it priced the shadow rows until plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3 (ruling
    R-BAL167 class 1).

    """What a SCREEN shows for *legs* -- the figure the amount model resolves.

    Plan step X-au-c2b split ``live_loan_transfer_amounts`` into an owner-scoped
    DERIVATION and a per-row lookup, and collapsed the settle-time twin
    ``live_loan_payment_amount`` into the same rule; plan step X-au-g-2c-2 then
    deleted that rule outright, because a transfer shadow stores no figure for a
    read-time override to supersede.  So the map this file grades is the
    amount model's own, and the assertions below keep their original figures.
    It was ``cash_ledger.amounts_by_id`` over the shadow rows, keyed by
    transaction id, until plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3 stopped the shadows
    being born; it is ``cash_ledger.leg_amounts_by_key`` over the legs now,
    keyed by ``leg.cell_key`` -- what the grid publishes for a leg since plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-6-1`` (ruling **R-BAL167** class 4).

    **It covers EVERY leg it is given, where the override map covered only the
    rows that had one.**  That is the substantive difference, and two cases turn
    on it: a manual payment and a non-derive transfer used to be ABSENT from the
    map (``assert overrides == {}``) and are now PRESENT with their definition's
    own price, which is a sharper claim -- absence could not distinguish "no
    override" from "not priced at all".

    A FRESH basis per call, deliberately: the cases that mutate an escrow line
    and re-read must see the new figure, and a basis memoizes each loan for the
    length of the read pass it was built for.

    Args:
        seed_user: The owner fixture; its user and scenario pin the basis.
        legs: The :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` values to
            price.

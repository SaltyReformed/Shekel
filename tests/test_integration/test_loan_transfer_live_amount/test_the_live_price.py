    Reverting EITHER end alone re-opens the gap this test exists to close: the
    cash would carry one escrow figure while the split backed out the other, and
    the $200.00 difference would land silently in PRINCIPAL, moving the recorded

    holds only when both ends read the same date.

    The loan originates 2026-02-01, the month before the one installment this
    case settles: every contractual installment from origination is charged

    The off-day case's loan (due the 22nd, originated 2026-01-22, first
    installment 02-22, escrow $100.00 a month).  Its row due **2026-02-10**
    falls after the origination and before the first installment, so no
    installment's interval holds it
    (:func:`~app.services.installment_calendar.installment_of` answers
    ``None``) and it is priced on its own date: P&I 1,199.10 + 02-10's
    escrow 100.00 = **1,299.10**.  Settled, the posted walk hands it NO
    charge -- nothing has fallen due yet -- so its whole cash is principal:
    interest 0.00, escrow 0.00, principal 1,299.10, and the loan's posted
    interest ledger books nothing.  Until plan step recurrence:R16-c-2 the
    settled walk charged a month at the payment's own date; only a hand-built
    stream pinned the new rule before this case.

    where it was read off the loan-side twin row (ruling R-BAL167 class 1,
    plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-2).  The payment is the TRANSFER due
    2026-02-10, settled through its leg on the loan, where it was the
    loan-side shadow due that day until plan step balance:X-bi-6-4d-3

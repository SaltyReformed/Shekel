        **This is the case that decided the scope** (ruling **R-IN**).  The loan
        dashboard's one-click "track the contract" creates or flips the
        ``loan_payment_settings`` row on a definition whose transfers are
        already generated.  Under the narrower design -- only loan-payment
        shadows declared -- those legs would still have been OWNING a stale
        figure at that moment, so the route would have needed a writer to
        declare them, and the button's own docstring promise ("no shadow
        regeneration is needed") would have become false.

        Every transfer shadow is derived from birth, so the flip writes no row
        at all: what changes is which RULE prices them, read live off the
        template (ruling **R-FK**).

        **The ``updated_at`` assertion below is NOT the measurement a draft of
        this docstring claimed it was**, and saying so beats leaving a stronger
        claim standing.  It named the mutation "a writer added to
        ``track_payment`` to declare the legs" -- but that writer is
        ``declare_derived``, which would set ``estimated_amount`` to the ``None``
        it already holds and the source to the id it already holds.  SQLAlchemy
        emits no UPDATE for a net-zero attribute history, so ``updated_at``'s
        ``onupdate`` never fires and the assertion passes.  It can only catch a
        writer that changes a VALUE, which is a weaker and different thing.

        What the case does hold: the legs' declaration is unchanged across the
        flip, and what they are WORTH moves from the parent's stale ``$1.00`` to
        the loan's ``$1,499.10`` -- so the route reprices without a writer, which
        is the scope argument (**R-IN**) itself.

        **R-BAL167** class 1): no shadow row is born, both legs are read off
        the transfer (**R-BAL13**), so what they are worth is
        :func:`~tests._test_helpers.transfer_amount` and the row the flip must
        not write is the transfer -- its declaration (``TEMPLATE``) and its
        ``updated_at``, stamped where each shadow's were, with the caveat
        above unchanged.  The figures are the same two.

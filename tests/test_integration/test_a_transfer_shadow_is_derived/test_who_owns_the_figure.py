        ``test_an_AD_HOC_retype_now_TAKES_both_legs``; ruling **R-BAL167**
        class 1).  What it was written to state -- an ad-hoc retype TAKES both
        legs, where it once left them derived, the arm that changed at plan
        step X-au-h -- was a change in the legs' ROWS, and no leg row is born
        since that step.  An ad-hoc transfer owns its figure from birth and
        both legs are read off it (**R-BAL13**), so there is no derived leg
        left to take and nothing for the X-au-h arm to change.  What stands is
        the rest of the case: the retype lands on the one row as `$400.00` and
        the route raises no ``is_override`` for a row with no template.  The
        paragraphs below describe the three-row shape this case was written
        against.

        **"The row still owns it" is a REFUSAL, not an ``owns_its_amount``
        read** (ruling **R-BAL167** class 1 with a refusal ADDED, the cp2c
        review's L-4: the case planted nothing, so the refusal is a shape it
        adds, not one it planted; labelled class 2 until checkpoint 2d-a).
        ``ck_transfers_adhoc_owns_amount`` refuses an ad-hoc transfer that
        declares a derived figure, so ``owns_its_amount`` is ``True`` for every
        ad-hoc row the database holds and the two reads it took could not
        fail.  The case asserts the database refuses the other state instead,
        on the retyped row.  Where the legs were rows the precondition
        discriminated -- they were born derived beside a parent that owned
        its figure -- and that difference is what the transfer cannot have.

        The old discriminator was ``is_override``, and
        ``routes/transfers/mutations.py`` raises that flag only for a
        template-linked row -- so an AD-HOC transfer's retype fell to the
        definition arm and left both legs DERIVED.  Authorship is now stated by
        the door for every row, so an ad-hoc retype takes them.

        **It moves no money and cannot**: an ad-hoc transfer has no template,
        ``loan_payment_settings`` is keyed by ``transfer_template_id``, so it
        can never be a derive-mode loan payment -- the arm where a leg's
        derivation differs from its parent's figure.  Both arms answer the
        typed figure.  What changes is that three rows now STORE it where one
        did, which is the shape X-au-m finishes.

        Graded because an adversarial review found the paragraph documenting the
        old arm had been deleted along with the comparison it described, leaving
        the change undocumented AND untested in either direction.

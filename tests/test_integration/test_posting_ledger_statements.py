"""The confirmed-ledger statements oracle (Build-Order Step 5, Commit 13).

The correctness gate for the READ side of Step 5: the two confirmed-ledger
statements (:mod:`app.services.ledger_report_service`) -- an income statement
(pay-period AND calendar windows) and a balance sheet (as-of a date, with a
trial-balance tie-out) -- read against an independent second opinion re-derived
from the posting ledger and the source tables, never against the readers that
produced the numbers.  This is the FOURTH reconciliation oracle, the read-side
sibling of the account-anchor write oracle
(``test_posting_ledger_account_anchor_reconciliation.py``); together they pin the
Step-5 promise that the trial balance closes app-wide and ``A = L + E`` is
checkable end to end.

**Non-tautological by construction**, in the same three independent ways the
other posting-ledger oracles are:

  * **hand-computed literals** -- every expected statement line, section total,
    net income, and tie-out figure is the test author's arithmetic over the
    seeded anchors and settled amounts, owing nothing to the reader under test
    (e.g. a $1000 opening + $3000 salary - $400 groceries - $50 uncategorized -
    $150 transfer out => Checking asset 3400.00);
  * **an independent balance-sheet re-derivation** (:func:`_independent_bs`) --
    a genuine second opinion that groups ``account_postings`` by ledger-account
    CLASS directly (a different path than the reader's source-bucket
    attribution), signs each class from a test-local debit-normal set (NOT the
    ref-cache flag the reader signs by), and derives retained earnings from the
    Income + Expense debit nets, so a classification / signing / retained-earnings
    bug in the reader cannot hide;
  * **structural invariants** the readers must satisfy regardless of any single
    figure -- the accounting identity ``A = L + E`` at multiple as-of dates,
    ARTICULATION (income net over a window + that window's equity corrections
    equals the equity delta between the bounding balance sheets), and
    period-vs-calendar agreement on an aligned fixture.

Every account and settle is produced through the REAL go-forward primitives --
``create_account`` (the C6 opening sync), ``create_settled_cash_transaction`` /
``create_settled_transfer`` (the status seam + posting builder),
``create_loan_with_trueup`` + a settled payment (the Step-4 loan split),
``_true_up_at`` (the anchor-true-up chokepoint's two steps) -- so every
reconciled statement was posted exactly as production posts it.  The one
non-production affordance is pinning an anchor row's ``created_at`` (via
:func:`_true_up_at`, the C8 technique) so a true-up's civil-day partition is
deterministic regardless of the test clock.  Sources are pinned to noon-UTC
paid dates so their storage (UTC) civil date and their display-timezone
attribution date coincide -- except the dedicated display-timezone case, which
pins an 8:05pm-Eastern Dec-31 settle precisely to prove the two diverge as L9
requires.

An adversarial case proves the oracle is not vacuous: injecting one unbalanced
leg pushes ``tie_out.ledger_net`` off zero and flips ``in_balance`` to False.
Every other (balanced) fixture asserts the whole-DB trial balance is zero and no
entry is malformed (:func:`_assert_ledger_self_consistent`), so a lone-leg bug
cannot slip past.  All money is ``Decimal`` from strings, with the arithmetic
shown per the testing standard.

          - expense "Family: Groceries" $300.00  paid 2099-05-02

            1000 + 800 - 300 = 1500, so the equity correction delta is +100.00)

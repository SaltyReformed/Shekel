"""Commit 15: loan-resolver single-source-of-truth integration locks.

Symptom #5 (loan facet) and F-008 / F-015 / F-016 family: pre-E-18,
three sources rendered "this loan's current balance" -- the loan
card read the STORED ``LoanParams.current_principal`` column, the
/savings debt card read the same stored column, and the year-end
net-worth liability read the schedule rendered by
``amortization_engine.generate_schedule`` with payments=ALL.  The
three values silently diverged whenever the stored column was not
re-typed after a settle (the symptom-#3 frozen-principal bug).

Commit 15 routes every display surface through
``loan_resolver.resolve_loan`` so the same dollar appears on every
card.  These tests lock that invariant: render the loan dashboard
card, the /savings debt card row, and the resolver-derived
net-worth liability against the same fixture and assert they all
report the same Decimal.  Plus C15-6 (settled-transfer-reduces-
card, deferred from Commit 14) and C15-2 (ARM fixed-window payment
stability across surfaces).

Hand-computed expectations follow the same arithmetic conventions
as ``tests/test_integration/test_loan_principal_settles.py`` so the
two files reinforce each other.  Schema-tier locks for the migration
demotion (C15-4 column nullability, C15-5 downgrade round-trip) live
in ``tests/test_models/test_loan_params_demoted.py``; the grep
sweep gate (C15-3) lives in ``tests/test_audit_fixes.py``.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Every Test Request Reads Its Own Signed-In User

The guard for ledger row ``balance:BAL-521`` (plan step ``balance:X-cr``):
**a test client never sees another client's identity.**

The defect it guards.  The ``db`` fixture runs every test inside ONE
application context, and Flask 3.1's ``RequestContext.push`` REUSES an
already-pushed application context of the same app instead of pushing a
fresh one.  ``flask.g`` lives on the application context, so before the fix
every request a test issued shared one ``g`` -- with each other and with the
test body.  Flask-Login caches the request's user in ``g._login_user`` the
first time ``current_user`` is read -- ``login_user`` and ``logout_user``
overwrite it -- and never re-reads the cookie while that attribute exists, so
once any request had cached a user, every later request was answered as that
user, whichever client sent it.  ``second_auth_client``'s own login POST was
answered "already signed in" and never signed the second user in at all.
Production never had this: each request there gets an application context,
and so a ``g``, of its own.

The fix is in the harness, not the application:
``tests/_per_request_globals.py`` gives every test-client request a ``g`` of
its own for exactly the length of the request, and puts the test's own ``g``
back afterwards.  ``tests/conftest.py`` installs it on the ``Flask`` class, so
an app a test builds for itself gets it too.

How these cases read identity.  ``base.html`` renders the signed-in user's
full display name in the user menu's one ``dropdown-header``, from the
``current_user`` that request resolved -- so the header IS whom the request
ran as.  A page that names nobody is an anonymous answer.

Shekel Budget App -- Flask-Limiter Integration Tests

Asserts that the rate-limit posture introduced by audit Commit C-06
(F-034) survives end-to-end:

- The per-IP default ceiling (200/hour, 30/minute) applies to routes
  with NO explicit ``@limiter.limit`` decorator, closing the gap that
  4 of ~93 mutating routes were rate-limited pre-remediation.
- The ``/health`` endpoint is exempt so the Docker / Nginx healthcheck
  loops do not burn through the per-IP budget every 30 seconds.
- The configured key_func is ``get_remote_address`` so per-IP
  separation actually works.
- A storage backend outage (Redis unreachable in production)
  fail-closed surfaces as a server error, NOT a silent degradation
  to per-worker memory or to allowing the request through (which
  would let an attacker brute-force auth during a Redis outage).
- 429 responses include the ``Retry-After`` header so a well-behaved
  client knows when to retry.
- ``X-RateLimit-*`` headers are emitted when the limiter is active.

The tests use the same "fresh app + flip RATELIMIT_ENABLED" pattern
already in tests/test_routes/test_errors.py and tests/test_routes/
test_auth.py, so a single change to the toggle pattern would surface
in all rate-limit suites at once.

Storage backend: TestConfig forces ``memory://`` regardless of the
operator's environment, so these tests run on any laptop without a
Redis instance.  The behavior under Redis unreachability is verified
by patching the storage's ``incr`` method to raise -- this exercises
the same code path Flask-Limiter takes when redis-py raises a real
ConnectionError (see flask_limiter._extension.py:1142-1169).

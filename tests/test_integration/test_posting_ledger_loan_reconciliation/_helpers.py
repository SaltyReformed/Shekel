    IMPORTANT -- this is a STRUCTURAL / reader-consistency sweep, NOT a split-VALUE
    check.  (a)/(b)/(c)/(e) are accounting IDENTITIES: given Step 2 is correct and
    every correction balances (both DB-enforced by ``ck_account_postings_balanced``),
    they hold no matter WHAT interest/principal the split posted -- if the split
    booked interest 700 instead of 500, ``per_loan`` and the loan leg both shift and
    the identities still pass (this is why, in the injected-``+$10`` experiment, only
    the two invariant-only tests survived).  So every caller MUST pair this with a
    value assertion -- a parallel-run ``ledger == resolver`` or a hand-computed
    literal -- which is what actually pins the split; the sweep's job is to catch a
    reader / scenario-scope / routing / balance defect the value checks do not.
    (b)/(c) also assume the loan has NO OUTBOUND transfer:
    ``_independent_settled_income_cash`` sums transfers INTO the loan only, which
    restates ``settled_transfer_effect`` faithfully only while every loan side is a
    to-side (income) -- true for a payment, false for a hypothetical disbursement.
    That assumption is now ENFORCED, not merely relied on: a transfer OUT of a
    loan is rejected at creation
    (``transfer_service`` / ``_reject_transfer_out_of_loan``, review R6), so every
    transfer touching a loan is a payment IN by construction.

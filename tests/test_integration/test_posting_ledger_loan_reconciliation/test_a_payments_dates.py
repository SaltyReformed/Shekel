    """A payment settled LATE is credited to the installment it actually paid.

    The real-world case the suite was blind to, and the root defect it hid.  A
    monthly loan payment is due on the loan's ``payment_day``, but the operator
    marks it paid whenever they actually pay it -- and over a weekend or a
    holiday that is routinely a few days late, which lands the transaction in the
    NEXT biweekly pay period.  Its pay period then no longer contains its due
    date.

    The engine used to RE-DERIVE each payment's due date from its pay period
    (``monthly_due_date`` of the period start).  For a late payment that returns
    the FOLLOWING month's installment: a February payment recorded as a March
    one.  Two consequences, both pinned here:

    * the payment history / amortization table shows an installment the operator
      never paid (the reported symptom); and
    * the CONFIRMED schedule row is stamped with a date that can be in the
      FUTURE, so every date-basis balance walk that reads the schedule silently
      disagrees with the ledger, which books by pay period.

    The engine now reads the payment's OWN stored ``due_date``
    (``loan_loaders.loan_payment_due_date``), so the pay period governs only the
    CASH (which period booked it) and the due date governs only the INSTALLMENT.

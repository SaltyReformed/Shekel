"""Static gate: the net-worth band vocabulary is ONE set in four languages.

Plan step X-t3, finding N-108.  A composition band is a cockpit CATEGORY, and
the same five keys are spelled out in places that no compiler, linter or
import can hold together:

* **Python** -- ``_display._CATEGORY_ORDER``, from which
  ``_net_worth._COMPOSITION_BANDS`` is now derived (that half is a real
  deletion, not a gate), plus ``_horizon``'s ``_ENGINE_BANDS`` and its derived
  ``_PARAM_GROWTH_BANDS``;
* **JavaScript** -- ``net_worth_cockpit.js``: ``ASSET_BANDS`` +
  ``LIABILITY_BAND`` (which datasets get stacked), ``BAND_LABELS`` (the tooltip
  and dataset names), ``BAND_FILL_ALPHA`` (each band's fill opacity);
* **Jinja** -- ``savings/_cockpit.html``: ``category_labels`` and
  ``category_icons``, the microcopy for the legend and the group headers, and
  the two bare ``category_name == '<key>'`` comparisons that give the
  Liabilities group its danger subtotal and decide whether the debt-summary
  footer renders at all (plan step X-z3, ruling R-CR -- the liability rule's
  third spelling, which this file read the same template for and did not see);
* **CSS** -- ``accounts.css``: the ``--nw-band-*`` color tokens the chart reads
  off ``:root`` and the ``.nw-legend__swatch--*`` classes the legend paints.

(This opened "in FIVE languages" and lists four; corrected at X-z3 while adding
a home to one of them, on Section 7.6's rule to re-verify what you touch.  A
count in a docstring is a claim -- Section 8, paid for four times by X-v's
reviews alone.)

**Why a gate and not a refactor.**  The Python half was two lists and is now
one.  The other four cannot import it: the chart script is served to a browser,
the CSS token has to exist before a stylesheet is parsed, and the microcopy is
display text.  Nothing in the toolchain fails when they drift, and the drift is
NOT cosmetic -- the server sums ``net`` over EVERY band while the client stacks
only the bands it knows, so a band added to the Python vocabulary and nowhere
else ships a per-period float series the browser drops on the floor AND makes
the drawn stack stop reconciling to the drawn net line.  That is money missing
from a chart with nothing failing, which is finding N-100's class one language
over.

Reading a repository file by path and asserting on its text is an established
shape here (``test_template_no_money_arithmetic.py``,
``test_posting_ref_seed_parity.py``).  Each arm below is matched against a
DECLARATION -- an array literal, an object literal's keys, a custom-property
definition, a class selector -- never a bare mention, and every source is
COMMENT-STRIPPED before it is scanned, so a band named in a comment cannot
satisfy any arm (finding N-63's lesson: a static guard that greps for a name
cannot tell code from prose).

**Both of those properties were checked by exercising the helpers, not by
reading them** (plan step X-t5, out of X-t's adversarial review).  The first
draft matched the declaration but scanned its body RAW, so

.. code-block:: javascript

    var ASSET_BANDS = [
      "asset", "retirement", "investment"  // "other" dropped
    ];

satisfied the arm that exists to catch exactly that -- the client stacking three
bands' worth of a four-band sum, which is the "drawn stack stops reconciling to
the drawn net line" this file was written for.  Two of the five arms had the
hole; the comment strip below closes it for all five and
:class:`TestTheGateItself` plants that source and requires a failure.

**What these arms do NOT prove**, stated so it is not mistaken for more: they
check that each DECLARATION carries the right keys, never that the client
USES the declaration.  Rewiring ``readBandColors`` to iterate some other list
would leave every arm green.  That is N-63's lesson one level up, and the honest
answer to it is the behavioural render assertions in ``test_savings.py``, not a
static scan.

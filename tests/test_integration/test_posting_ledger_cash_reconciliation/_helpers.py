# These deliberately re-derive each side from scratch so the oracle is a genuine
# second opinion: a bug shared by the two service readers cannot hide, because
# the ledger side here reads ``account_postings`` and the source side reads
# ``transactions``, ``transfers`` and ``transaction_entries`` with
# independently-written SQL/Python, and both are also
# pinned to hand-computed literals.  (The source side necessarily restates the
# one correct definition of a family's cash effect -- its dated non-card
# movements, plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a`` -- so it mirrors
# ``posted_purchase_effect``'s semantics; the hand-computed literals, not these
# queries, are what make the oracle non-tautological -- this layer adds the
# cross-table, whole-DB sweep the literals cannot.)
#
# Some of these (``_independent_ledger_sum``, ``_trial_balance``,
# ``_entries_violating_balance``, ``_independent_transfer_shadow_effect``) mirror
# the Step-2 oracle (``test_posting_ledger_reconciliation.py``).  The duplication
# is DELIBERATE, not an oversight: each oracle keeps its OWN independent
# reconciliation queries so it remains a self-contained second opinion (the
# Step-2 module docstring states the same "re-derive from scratch" intent).
# Genuinely shared *utilities* with no independence role (the migration loader,
# the raw-SQL posting clear, the account-pairing lookup) live in
# ``tests/_test_helpers.py`` instead.

    A ``transaction_id IS NULL`` group is a hard-deleted transaction's

    a transfer SIDE's record books its cash leg against it, so a side's net

    every category row obeys -- the from-side record lands ``+figure`` on
    transit, the to-side record's ``-figure`` -- and the routing check for a
    side is that the counter IS the transit row, never a category.  Across a
    settled pair the two nets cancel, which the trial-balance and per-linked
    sweeps read as transit at zero.  **Each side's legs are grouped by its
    RECORD** since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``: the record hangs off

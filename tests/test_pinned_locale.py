Shekel Budget App -- The Pinned Process Locale

Tests that the application factory refuses to start under any ``LC_ALL`` but
the pinned one, and that the production image sets that one (plan step
``recurrence:R12``, ruling ``R-R92``).  A module of its own because the refusal
is the factory's, not a configuration class's, and ``tests/test_config.py``
sits at pylint's module-length ceiling.

"""The test clock reaches the DATABASE clock (finding N-65).

``tests/test_services`` freezes ``date.today()`` to 2026-03-20, inside the
``seed_periods`` window.  PostgreSQL's clock was untouched, and it answers in
FOUR places: 61 columns take their INSERT value from a ``NOW()`` server
default, one (``transaction_entries.entry_date``) from a raw-text
``CURRENT_DATE`` default, 23 of them re-stamp on UPDATE, and ``status_seam``
assigns ``db.func.now()`` to ``Transaction.settled_on`` outright.  So a fixture that
settled a row "now" stamped it at the real wall clock -- months outside the
periods the test seeded -- and the balance fold, which dates every event,
replayed it outside the window entirely.  Nothing noticed while the shipping
producers read the LATEST anchor row and ignored its date; the fold made the
instant load-bearing.

The per-fixture mitigations (``override_anchor``'s period-start default,
``conftest._pin_opening_to``, an explicit settle day) stay and are unaffected
-- this pins the STRUCTURAL half that stops a fourth instance:
``_test_helpers._freeze_db_clock``.  Read its docstring for the design and its
one stated boundary.

Every assertion below is against a stored value read back from PostgreSQL,
never against the helper's own bookkeeping.

        **A soft-deleted transfer is in NEITHER half, by design**, whatever
        its status: each half filters ``Transfer.is_deleted``.  It is no
        member here, because "neither" is a different claim than "exactly
        one".  A soft delete through the door takes a Paid payment's records
        off and returns it as a plan (ruling **R-BAL246**), so the PLAN
        half's filter is what drops a deleted Projected or Paid payment,
        graded by ``test_loan_payment_service/test_the_payment_history.py``'s
        ``test_excludes_deleted_transactions`` (both its cases); a ``$0.00``
        close held nothing and stays Paid (measured 2026-10-15), so the
        SETTLED half's filter is what drops that one, graded by
        :meth:`test_a_soft_deleted_zero_dollar_close_is_in_neither_half`.

        The old partition keyed the settled half on the TWIN's status, so a
        twin Paid under a Projected parent was in BOTH halves and a parent
        Paid over a still-Projected twin in neither.  Each transfer carries
        its own figure because ``uq_transfers_adhoc_dedupe`` refuses two
        identical ad-hoc transfers in one period.

        **The reverted member is the boundary of "its money moved"** (ruling
        **R-BAL140**): the revert KEEPS its records and releases their days
        (ruling **R-BAL61**), so records EXIST and none is DATED; the plan
        emits a leg for a side with no dated movement (ruling **R-BAL79**),
        and the settled half, the plan half's complement, does not hold it.
        It is a NEW member at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``: no member
        stood in that state before.

        **Since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``** each side's record hangs
        off the transfer (ruling **R-BAL88**) and no reader reads a twin
        (ruling **R-BAL167**).  Two plants are REFUSED at commit (class 2)
        and asserted so: Cancelling the Cancelled-over-records member over
        its two DATED records (the status-band rule; it was "Cancelled over a
        dated movement", and its storable neighbour -- Paid, reverted and
        Cancelled through the door, its records kept un-dated -- is what
        stands, excluded as before); and un-dating the last member's loan
        side under its Paid parent (the band again; rolled back, Paid and
        dated, settled as it was -- its walk's refusal is
        :class:`TestASettledPaymentWithAnUndatedRecordFailsLoud`'s).

        **Four members left at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``**, where a
        transfer became one row (ruling **R-BAL258**).  Three planted the
        loan-side twin first: Paid with nothing moved, Paid with a dated
        movement under it, and that one with its twin hidden.  The twin is
        refused at the write by ``ck_transactions_names_no_transfer``
        whatever it carries -- measured bare, dated, Paid and dated, and Paid,
        dated and hidden -- so the movement and the hide planted after it can
        never be written: ONE refused shape, pinned on the income side by
        ``test_a_transfer_shadow_is_derived/test_the_declaration.py``'s
        ``TestAShadowIsBornDerived`` case
        ``test_the_transfer_owns_its_figure_and_neither_twin_can_be_stored``
        and, for a loan payment, by ``test_loan_plan_assembly.py``'s
        ``test_a_projected_loan_payment_is_priced_and_its_derived_twin_refused``.
        The fourth, "parent Paid, twin still Projected" (its status written
        past the seam), is without its twin the SAME stored state as the
        ``$0.00`` close: measured, every ``budget.transfers`` column is equal
        bar the literal figure and name (the close stores its PLAN figure:
        ``$0.00`` is the absence of a record, ruling **R-BAL141**), both are
        Paid over no side record, and this partition reads nothing else --
        the posting ledger included.  R-BAL140's "settled parent with no
        movement" drift is therefore no longer a state distinct from the
        close, which holds it.

        Not a member of the partition above: "neither half" is its own claim.
        The door's soft delete takes a Paid payment's records off and returns
        it as a plan (ruling **R-BAL246**), so a deleted payment that held
        records is the PLAN half's filter's to drop
        (``test_loan_payment_service/test_the_payment_history.py``'s
        ``test_excludes_deleted_transactions``).  A ``$0.00`` close holds no
        record (ruling **R-BAL141**: ``$0.00`` is the absence of one), so the
        delete takes nothing off and keeps it Paid
        (:func:`~app.utils.balance_predicates.delete_returns_to_plan`), and
        only the SETTLED half's own ``Transfer.is_deleted`` filter drops it.
        That half is the view the loan walk, the posting reader and the
        escrow guard read (:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.income_legs`
        names them), so a deleted close it kept would still book the 03-01
        installment's whole charge as unpaid -- the split
        :class:`TestAZeroDollarCloseIsDatedByTheInstallmentItSkips` reads on
        a live close -- for a payment its owner deleted.

        The close is read before the delete too: in the settled half, with
        one split on the installment, so the delete is what moves it.  The
        guards: before the delete the close holds no side record (why the
        door keeps it Paid); after it, it is hidden and still settled.  A
        side record is not read AFTER the delete, because that read could not
        fail: the door takes every side record off before it hides the
        transfer (``movement_removal.remove_movements``, then ``is_deleted``,
        in ``transfer_service._delete``), so no transfer it deletes holds
        one, and the database makes that unbreakable -- it refuses to hide a
        transfer still holding one
        (``budget.refuse_hiding_a_transfer_holding_money`` in
        ``app/deleted_row_infrastructure.py``, ruling **R-CC92**).  Measured
        2026-10-15 on this case with the close settled at its plan and a
        delete that took nothing off: the commit was refused, "transfer 1
        was deleted while it still holds a recorded payment: take it off the
        books first".

        **The plan-half read is DOMINATED** (``after.projected == []``).  The
        deleted close is hidden AND Paid, so either of the plan half's two
        clauses drops it alone: it survived each dropped by itself, and
        failed first with both dropped at once (measured 2026-10-15).  Each
        clause is graded where it fails first -- ``Transfer.is_deleted`` by
        ``test_loan_payment_service/test_the_payment_history.py``'s
        ``test_excludes_deleted_transactions``, the Projected test by
        :meth:`test_every_transfer_state_lands_in_exactly_one_half` and by the
        two ``$0.00``-close dating cases in ``test_the_zero_dollar_close.py``,
        ``test_the_close_is_visible_from_its_installment_not_its_settle_day``
        and ``test_a_close_due_mar_10_is_dated_by_the_feb_22_installment`` --
        and the status guard here holds the Paid that keeps the second true.
        It stays as the claim's other half.

        Added at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``, because no PASSING test
        failed with the settled half's filter dropped (measured 2026-10-15:

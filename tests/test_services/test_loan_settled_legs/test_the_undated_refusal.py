        """Drift B over a kept movement: the walk refuses, naming the TRANSFER.

        The transfer says Paid, and the record its leg carries -- the kept
        covering movement -- carries no day.  Read off the transfer, that is
        the broken settled-without-a-day state the refusal exists for: a day
        guessed here would put money on a day nothing recorded, and the
        R-BAL139 installment day is for a payment that moved NOTHING, not
        for one whose movement lost its day.  The refusal names the payment as
        its owner finds it in the app -- the transfer's own name (its
        popover's title) and its two accounts, the figure, the paycheck and
        the due date -- with the
        transfer's and the movement's ids, because ruling R-BAL147's "you fix
        the row through the app" is the TRANSFER once the movement re-parents.
        It named the row the movement hangs off, the twin, whose own status is
        Projected, until leaf balance:X-bi-6-4d-1 (a re-expression under
        R-BAL167 class 1).  Until plan step balance:X-bi-6-4b the twin's
        status kept this payment out of the loan entirely.

        Two unrelated transfers are built FIRST so the transfer's and the
        movement's ids differ: in a fresh database each counts from 1, and a
        message naming the twin's id where the movement's belongs passed the
        leaf's first version of this case.  The twin's id joined the check
        until plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` made a transfer one row
        (ruling **R-BAL258**; ruling **R-BAL167** class 4, through the
        helper :func:`_stage_an_undated_loan_side`).

        **Staged inside the save since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``**
        (ruling **R-BAL167** class 2): the movement is the loan side's record
        on the transfer (ruling **R-BAL88**), and the status-band rule
        refuses a settled transfer holding an un-dated one at COMMIT, so the
        state exists only inside the save that writes it -- where the walk is
        asked, and refuses, as before -- and the commit is then asserted

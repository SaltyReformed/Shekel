"""Lifecycle tests for the transfer -> posting-ledger wiring (Step 2, Commit 5).

Commit 5 wires :func:`~app.services.posting_service.sync_transfer_postings`
into the transfer service's mutation chokepoints (``update_transfer`` /
``delete_transfer`` / ``restore_transfer``), so settling, reverting,
cancelling, deleting, and restoring a transfer keep the append-only
double-entry ledger in step WITHOUT any caller touching ``posting_service``
directly.  These tests drive transfers END TO END through ``transfer_service``
only (the way the mark-done / cancel / delete routes do) and assert the
resulting ledger state.  **A settled transfer is TWO entries since plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-3``** (rulings **R-BAL45** and **R-BAL101**): one per side's
covering movement, each against the owner's Transfers-in-transit account, so
every act below writes a PAIR of entries and every figure a real account
carries is what the one-entry shape gave it; the cases were re-expressed for
the pair when the shape moved (each docstring says how).  The truth table:

  * ``projected -> done``       posts two balanced entries (+effect);
  * ``done -> settled``         is an idempotent no-op (already at target);
  * ``done -> projected``       reverses them to net zero (append-only);
  * ``projected -> cancelled``  posts nothing (never settled);
  * soft-delete of a settled transfer reverses, and restore re-posts;
  * hard-delete of a settled transfer reverses, then the immutable pairs
    survive with their movement links SET NULL;
  * a double mark-done never double-posts;
  * settling and setting the figure in ONE call posts the RECORDED figure
    (the reconcile runs after every kwarg is applied, NOT inside the
    status-change helper -- the placement that makes the grid shadow-edit
    path correct).

After each mutation the per-account reconciliation invariant is asserted in
its Build-Order Step 5 ABSOLUTE form: ``account_posting_total == opening
anchor + settled_transfer_effect``.  ``create_account`` posts each fixture
account's opening correction at create time (Checking $1000.00, the Savings
$100.00 sentinel), and every settle here is stamped at server-now -- AFTER the
origination assertion -- so the settled-shadow effect is exactly the
post-assertion effect riding on top of the opening.  All money is ``Decimal``
from strings, with the arithmetic shown per the testing standard.

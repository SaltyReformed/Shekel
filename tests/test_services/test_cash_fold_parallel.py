"""X-b / X-c2b2: the three cash seam entries ARE the fold, on every day.

Plan steps X-b and X-c2b2 (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).
Runs ``balance_at._cash_fold``'s own reading against the three seam entries
-- ``cash_balance_map``, ``cash_balance_at`` and ``cash_daily_balance_series`` --
on **EVERY DAY** of each shape's domain.

**This file changed sides at the cutover, and the fixtures did not.**  At plan
step X-b the three entries were separate producers carrying the live findings
this phase exists to close, so equality was NOT the pass condition: on a shape
that triggered a finding the fold had to DIFFER, in hand-computed dollars, and
:class:`TestEveryFindingIsClosedAtTheSeam` asserted the size of each gap.  Plan
step X-c2b2 pointed all three at the fold, so those same shapes and those same
figures now assert the CLOSED state -- the seam answering what only the fold used
to.  Each test names the figure the retired producer returned beside the one the
seam returns now, which is the moved-figure record in executable form: revert
the cutover and the old number comes back, and the test says so.

* :class:`TestACleanShapeAgreesOnEveryDay` -- on a shape that triggers no
  finding, all three entries and the fold agree on every day of the domain.
  Since the cutover this is structural rather than a coincidence, and it is
  still worth pinning: it is what proves a scalar, a period map and a daily
  series are ONE running total read at three grains rather than three producers
  that happen to line up.
* :class:`TestEveryFindingIsClosedAtTheSeam` -- on a shape that triggers a
  finding, the seam answers the fold's figure, on named days and to the cent.

**Sampling is forbidden.**  A 14-day sample once scored perfect while wrong by
$178,103.41 on 22% of days (plan Section 7.2), so each comparison walks every
day of its range and guards the loop so a vacuous domain cannot pass.

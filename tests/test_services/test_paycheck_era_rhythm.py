"""
Shekel Budget App -- a paycheck is priced at the rhythm IN FORCE on its payday.

Plan step **salary:X-av-2** (ruling **R-SAL66**; ledger row **SAL-569**).  An
owner's pay history is a list of ERAS -- "paid monthly from January, then
biweekly from July" -- and until this step the paycheck engine read the LATEST
era's paychecks-a-year for every payday: a paycheck paid under the monthly era
was divided by 26, and its withholding annualised by 26, as though it had been
a biweekly one.  The count is now read per payday through
:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.cadence_on`, and the engine reads base pay
through ONE door, :meth:`~app.services.payroll_basis.PayrollBasis.base_pay_on`,
for the paycheck and for both year-to-date replays.

Every figure here is MADE UP (ruling **balance:R-BAL132**): a $60,000 salary,
no raises, and the engine suite's own two-bracket tax fakes, so each expected
value is hand-computed in the case that asserts it.

Two schedules, both stated in full so the paydays are read rather than
derived by the code under test:

* **Monthly then biweekly** -- the 1st of each month January-June 2026, then
  every 14 days from Thursday 2026-07-02.  The biweekly era's first payday
  replaces the monthly era's 2026-07-01 (ruling **R-PC75**).
* **The displaced first payday** -- monthly January-August 2026; biweekly under
  the ``prior`` convention from Monday 2026-09-07, which is Labor Day, so that
  era's first paycheck is paid on Friday 2026-09-04, BEFORE its own
  ``effective_from``; then weekly from 2027-01-11.  Three eras so that the old
  reader (the latest era, weekly), the nominal-day reader
  (:func:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.era_covering`, monthly) and the cash-day
  reader this step uses (biweekly) give three different answers.
* **A record paid early before a seam** -- 14 days from 2026-01-02, then 7 days
  from 2026-02-02, the record's last payday 2026-02-01: the 02-02 paycheck
  paid a day early, which the calendar closes at the WEEKLY rhythm.

**The paycheck also CARRIES the rhythm it was priced at** (ruling
**R-SAL70**): the savings page's debt-to-income denominator and months-of-income
goals, the retirement gap's current-pay fallback and the salary cockpit's
third-paycheck chip all turned today's paycheck into a month at the LATEST
era's count, which agreed with the engine only while it divided every payday
by that count.  :class:`TestTodaysPaycheckBecomesAMonthAtItsOwnRhythm` and
:class:`TestTheRecurringSalaryRow` grade each surface for an owner paid
biweekly today with a weekly rhythm recorded to start later (rulings
**R-SAL71** and **R-SAL73** for the Recurring page's salary row, which reads
today's priced paycheck rather than the template's stored copy).

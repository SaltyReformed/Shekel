"""Service tests for the confirmed-ledger reporting statements (Step 5, C9).

Hand-computed income statements and balance sheets over controlled fixtures,
each produced through the REAL go-forward primitives (``create_account`` fires
the opening sync; ``create_settled_cash_transaction`` /
``create_settled_transfer`` settle through the status seam + posting builder),
so every reconciled figure was posted exactly as production posts it.  The
expected numbers are the test author's arithmetic over the seeded anchors and
amounts, owing nothing to the reader under test.

Scope is the reporting SERVICE (``ledger_report_service``): the reader-contract
attribution rule (whole-source, display-timezone paid date; pay-period windows
by ``pay_period_id``), the natural-balance presentation and derived retained
earnings, the two-part balance-sheet tie-out, the kind-branched display labels,
and the residue drop.  The exhaustive cross-year / loan / articulation oracle is
Commit 13's ``test_posting_ledger_statements.py``.

Balance-sheet "full position" cases use a far-future ``as_of`` so every posted
source (including the seed Checking's opening, whose ``entry_date`` is its
origination ``created_at``'s civil date) is folded regardless of the test clock
or timezone; a dedicated case pins the as-of cutoff itself.

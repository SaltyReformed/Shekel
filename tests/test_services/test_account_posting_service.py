"""Tests for the account posting service (Build-Order Step 5, C5 + the C6 wiring).

:mod:`app.services.account_posting_service` posts a NON-loan account's anchor
assertions into the double-entry ledger: the once-per-account OPENING (its
earliest ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row) and a TRUE-UP per later row, each a
balanced correction driving the linked ledger's total to the asserted balance
as of the day it is the closing balance for.  The walk partitions source facts
by their settled CIVIL DAY (the stored ``settled_on``; transfers by the
income shadow's, period-start fallback) against each anchor's stored
``observed_on`` -- never by pay period (the plan review's CRITICAL-1) and never
by instant, which decided the question by click order and cost production
$4,001.42 (ruling R-DH).  These tests drive the walk and the sync entry points directly;
since C6 the lifecycle chokepoints are ALSO live underneath them --
``create_account`` posts each opening at fixture time and the effect-time
self-heal reconciles at every settle / revert -- so the explicit sync calls
double as idempotency proofs, and the step-count assertions reflect the eager
per-mutation reconcile (each intermediate state lands exactly on the anchor).

Fixtures are SYNTHETIC with HAND-COMPUTED literals, each docstring showing the
arithmetic.  Events are placed RELATIVE to the origination assertion's own
``observed_on`` (:func:`_origin_day`) in whole DAYS, through
``settle_instant_on`` so each lands at noon UTC on the intended civil day; a
case needing two events on ONE day uses a PINNED opening instead.  Both
conventions exist because a fixture that offsets from a RECORDING instant grades
a different case than it names -- twice now, from two different causes
(finding N-133 / F2, and the review of the F1 revert).  All money is ``Decimal``
from strings.

    and the period the entry was FILED under was copied from the history row's

    derivation and can be split from its own day by a clock.  Measured on a

    together afterwards, which is how the ledger and the grid came to disagree

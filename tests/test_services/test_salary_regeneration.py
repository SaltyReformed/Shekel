"""The salary regeneration is a service that takes the pass and returns what it kept.

Plan step **salary:S3-f-3**, ruling **R-SAL24**: the walk every salary write is
followed by moved below the route layer so the ``/retirement`` rail's end-year
Save could reach it.  What these cases grade is the CONTRACT the move changed
-- the two things the route-tier original did with Flask that the service now
does with plain data:

* it takes the request's :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`
  rather than building one from ``current_user`` (a producer below the route
  takes the pass; only a route builds one), so the owner it prices for is the
  pass's;
* it RETURNS the ids of the rows the regeneration declined to touch rather
  than flashing them, so each route reports them in its own voice -- and a
  retained row that was dropped on the way out would be a silent no-op
  (plan step R10-a).

What it does with a template-backed profile end to end -- the re-priced
template amount, the regenerated rows -- is graded where the doors are:
``tests/test_routes/test_salary.py`` for the salary page and
``tests/test_routes/test_retirement.py::TestTheRailSavesARaisesEndYear`` for
the rail, both of which observe the template's amount move.

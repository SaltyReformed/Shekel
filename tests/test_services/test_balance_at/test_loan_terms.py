    Since step C6b the seam's forward projection is a FOLD from the loan's
    confirmed-present seed over its :func:`~app.services.balance_at._plan.loan_plan`
    (payment records + contractual synthesis), not a walk of the resolver's
    schedule rows.  A trued-up loan's confirmed present is the TRUE-UP balance, and
    the fold seeds from exactly that -- never from a CONFIRMED schedule row's
    ``remaining_balance``, which is what the loan owed BEFORE the true-up and is
    arbitrarily stale (here by $48,496.25).

    This is the seam-level guard for that seeding.  The retired schedule walk had a
    ``_forward_rows`` ``is_confirmed`` filter to drop confirmed rows before walking
    (finding B-4); the fold has no such filter to get wrong -- it seeds from the
    ledger-confirmed balance and folds only PLANNED/ESTIMATED records forward, so a
    confirmed row's stale balance has no path into a future answer by construction.
    The unit-level proof that a settled payment is not re-folded as a future record
    is C6a's ``test_an_early_settled_payment_is_not_re_synthesized_as_estimated``;
    this pins the property at the seam, on a trued-up loan whose stale confirmed row

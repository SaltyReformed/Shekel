    fold that reads a row's own column contributes ``None`` for this row, and
    one that asks the amount model contributes *amount* -- so "the balance is
    built on the derivation" is a property of the DATA here rather than of a
    patched producer.

    The definition is priced through ``template_amount_service.set_amount``,
    the ONE write door for a price series, effective on the period's own
    start -- which is the due date the engine derives for an every-paycheck
    definition (``compute_due_date``), so ``amount_as_of`` resolves on it.
    The row itself is the engine's (:func:`generate_row_of`, plan step
    balance:X-cf), written into the owner's baseline scenario, which is
    what both callers price against.

    **``default_amount`` is deliberately NOT the graded figure.**  An
    adversarial review of plan step X-au-d found a first version setting both
    to *amount*, which makes the series and the scalar the same number -- and
    ``_stated_amount``'s empty-series refusal is then invisible: replacing that
    refusal with ``return template.default_amount``, the exact fallback its own
    message forbids, survives every case built on this helper.  A distinct
    scalar is what makes the series load-bearing.

    **Passing ``_NOT_THE_SERIES`` to the constructor did not achieve that, and
    plan step balance:X-cf-3 measured it.**  ``set_amount`` re-syncs
    ``default_amount`` onto the NEWEST version it states
    (``template_amount_service._resync_scalar``), so the constructor's
    ``7.77`` was overwritten with *amount* on the next line and the resolver
    mutated to read the scalar passed both cases.  The scalar holds
    ``_NOT_THE_SERIES`` the only way it can: as a SECOND version, effective
    the day after this row's due date, which the re-sync copies into the
    column while ``amount_as_of`` on the row's own day still answers

    paycheck budgets on the other members -- their expense less their income
    -- is the term between them.  ``TestTheRemainderOracleSeesEveryTerm``
    carries the control that a delta short its elsewhere term must not
    reconcile, beside the two it already carried for the modelled tiers.

    The CONTRIBUTION term is not decoration: dropping it breaks the identity on
    53 of 59 period pairs on the real Empower 401(k), worst $181.59 a column (a
    flat-percentage employer match), while including it holds on all 59.  It was
    written here at plan step X-g3a, where the grid's kind gate still admitted
    only INTEREST accounts and the term was therefore identically $0.00, so that
    the oracle was already in its final form when X-g3b's cutover put a figure
    in it.  X-g3b supplies the producer-side control that can distinguish the
    two forms.

    **The remainder became two terms at plan step S1-c** (ruling R-DH (f)).
    They are summed here rather than through a combined accessor because no
    combined accessor survives on :class:`~app.services.balance_at.GridColumn`:
    leaving one would invite a surface to render the sum again, which is the
    figure the ruling exists to delete.  Splitting them cannot change whether
    the identity holds -- both remainders are cent-quantized, so
    ``round(a) + round(b) == round(a + b)`` -- which is why this oracle's
    figures are unchanged by the split and its per-row discrimination lives in
    the tests that assert each row's own value.

    It reads ONE GridColumn per period rather than re-running the subtotal
    producer beside the balance producer, which is the point of plan steps
    X-c2b1 / X-c2b2: the identity is a property of the row set, so an oracle

    """An upcoming loan owes NOTHING until it originates.

    ``origination_date`` carries no not-future validator (unlike a true-up's
    ``anchor_date``), so configuring a mortgage that closes next month is a
    legitimate, reachable state -- and the developer ruled (2026-07-13) that the
    app must SUPPORT it.

    Before the origination-event fix the app reported the loan's FULL PRINCIPAL as
    owed at every pay period, for months before it closed.  The cause was not in
    the seam: ``select_latest_anchor`` picks the latest anchor BY DATE with no
    ``as_of`` filter, so the resolver seeded ``current_balance`` from an anchor
    dated in the FUTURE.  Six surfaces outside the seam read that field.

    The loan here originates 2026-04-15 -- AFTER the suite's frozen today
    (2026-03-20) and INSIDE the seeded period range -- so all four regions of its
    trajectory are assertable:

      1. before origination                 -> $0.00 (it does not exist)
      2. originated, before first payment   -> $200,000.00 (the opening balance)

        guard is left standing between an unclosed mortgage and RETIRED**: badged
        paid off, dropped from the debt card's total, gone from the Horizon, and
        erased from the property equity chart.

        This is the ONE shape in which that guard is the guard doing the work --

        (2026-03-01, from the period-start fallback) precedes the 2026-04-15
        origination.  Ruling R-C now REFUSES that write at the transfer boundary,
        because the fold erases such a payment: it splits against a zero balance,
        books $0.00 principal, routes the whole amount to a Refund Receivable, and
        the origination anchor then resets over it -- while the cash still leaves
        checking (finding FU-5).  A test may not rest on a write production
        forbids.

        So the payment is now one production CAN produce: its installment
        (2026-05-01, from ``periods[8]``) falls AFTER origination, so the boundary
        allows it, and it is SETTLED EARLY -- settled 2026-03-10, before the
        loan closes.  Paying an installment ahead of closing is legitimate and
        the fold splits it correctly.  The state under test is unchanged: one
        confirmed payment, a ``0.00`` balance, and a loan that has not

        ``_compute_principal_paid_fraction`` is an ALL-LOANS-EVER basis: every loan
        contributes its ``original_principal`` to the denominator, and a loan owing
        $0.00 therefore counts as fully repaid.  An unclosed $200,000 mortgage owes
        $0.00, so it landed in the denominator with its whole principal in the
        "paid" portion: beside a never-paid $100,000 auto loan the marker read
        200000/300000 = **66.67% of principal repaid** for a borrower who had
        repaid nothing.

        It also broke the marker's one design invariant -- monotonicity.  On
        closing day the mortgage's balance steps $0 -> $200,000 and the fraction
        would COLLAPSE from 66.67% to 0%.

        **It asserts through the PRODUCTION producer, which is finding B-17's
        repair** (plan step X-h).  It used to hand-build the per-account dict
        ``_compute_principal_paid_fraction`` reads and assert on that, so the
        builder that publishes the dict in production
        (``_projections._project_one_account``) never ran: change what IT
        publishes and the test stayed green, proving where the value comes FROM
        while never proving production puts it there.  ``compute_debt_summary``
        is the entry the budget dashboard's tracks section actually calls, and
        it runs the whole chain --
        load core data, load params, project every account through the real
        builder, then reduce.  The firing control this repair was shown against:
        forcing ``is_originated=True`` into the builder's published figures makes
        this read ``0.666...`` and fail, where the hand-built version could not
        see the change at all.

        The entry it names changed at plan step X-u (finding N-109), which
        deleted the ``compute_debt_principal_progress`` producer this read
        through and made the fraction a ``DebtSummary`` field; the chain it
        exercises is the same one, and the repair's whole point -- that the
        production builder RUNS -- is unaffected.

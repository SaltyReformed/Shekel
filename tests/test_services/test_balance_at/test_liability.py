        flat hold; the developer ruled the behaviour changed (R-CC14,
        2026-09-18), the one exception CLAUDE.md rule 5 allows.

        The card is asserted at ``-500.00``.  A ``$120.00`` purchase is planned
        in period 6 and a ``$200.00`` payment (an income row on the card) in
        period 8; the samples are today, the START of period 7 (after the
        purchase, before the payment) and the year end after next (after
        both).  Hand-computed, what the card owes is ``liability_sign.owed``
        of the held fold -- minus it (ruling R-CC47, plan step
        credit_card:CC-5-5c; it read ``abs(fold)`` until then, which agrees on
        a card that owes and parts on one holding a credit)::

        The second future point differs from the first, so a band that read
        ONE forward figure and repeated it, or that still held flat, fails
        here.  Every future point also equals the kind-correct scalar's own
        answer at that date: the band and ``balance_at`` are readings of ONE
        producer (``_kind_correct.balance_at_dates``), so the horizon cannot
        drift from the account page.

    """The scalar and the per-period map agree on every day of seven loan shapes.

    Defect 2a was a $3,455.79 divergence between ``balance_at`` and ``balance_map``
    for the same loan on the same day -- two producers the code's own docstrings
    called siblings, with nothing comparing them.  Since the cutover BOTH read the
    one loan producer :func:`~app.services.balance_at.positions` (the scalar at
    step C3b1, the per-period map at C3b3), so a divergence from two DIFFERENT
    readers is now structurally impossible -- which is the cutover's whole point.

    **What this now pins, stated plainly so the next reader does not over-trust
    it.**  Both sides call ``positions``, so this is no longer a two-reader
    comparison; it is a SAMPLING-consistency check.  It pins that the map's
    per-period sampler (:func:`~app.services.balance_at.positions_period_map`)
    asks ``positions`` at the SAME date the scalar is asked at for each period --
    ``min(period.end, as_of)`` for a begun period (the current-period clamp) and
    ``period.end`` for a future one.  A regression in that sampling -- most
    dangerously dropping the current-period clamp, which would hand the current
    period to the forward projection -- would surface here across all seven shapes,
    including the origination-inside-the-current-period keying trap (shape 6).  The
    balance VALUES themselves are pinned elsewhere: B2's fold-vs-reader oracle and
    the C6a hand-computed fold oracles (``test_loan_plan_forward_oracle.py`` and
    ``test_loan_plan_assembly.py``) -- plan Section 7.2: never two producers that
    share code proving each other.

    "Every loan shape the app can produce" is what this docstring used to claim.
    It is a fixture matrix, not a proof of exhaustiveness, and the shapes are
    enumerated rather than generated.

    **The probe date follows each period's OWN keying, and that is not a detail.**
    The map is period-END keyed since step C2 (a posting counts from its own
    ``entry_date``, which can fall mid period, so a payment settled during a period
    must count in it): a BEGUN period's confirmed value is the ledger at its END,
    and a FUTURE period's is the projection at its END.  The scalar reader,
    though, RAISES / PROJECTS for a future date, so the current period (begun, but
    its end is future) is probed at TODAY -- where the confirmed map, carrying every
    posting flat, equals the confirmed scalar.  Probing the current period at its
    END instead would compare the confirmed map to ``balance_at(period.end_date)``,
    which projects FORWARD (reducing by an overdue-but-unpaid installment -- FU-7)
    and is a different, smaller number.  Hence ``min(period.end_date, today)`` for a
    begun period, ``period.end_date`` for a future one.

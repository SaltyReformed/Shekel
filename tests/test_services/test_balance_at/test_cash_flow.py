    """Plan step credit_card:CC-4-1's PRODUCER-side control for the fifth term.

    Developer ruling ``credit_card:R-CC16``: the grid reads the owner's
    cash-flow set -- checking and its cards -- as ONE paycheck, so its
    subtotals sum every member's rows while the Projected End Balance stays one
    account's, and the identity gains ``elsewhere[p]``.  Ruling
    ``credit_card:R-CC23``: a transfer between two members counts ONCE, from
    the balance line's side.  ``TestTheRemainderOracleSeesEveryTerm`` grades
    the term on hand-built columns; this class puts a figure in it through
    :func:`~app.services.balance_at.grid_balance_view` itself.

    **The fixture is the ruling's own worked example**, on the paycheck
    ``seed_periods_today[6]``: the phone bill ``$45.00`` expected on the card,
    the grocery envelope ``$500.00`` on checking, and the ``$165.00`` card
    payment (checking -> card) in the same paycheck.  Hand-computed, with
    checking as the balance line::

        Total Income      0.00
        Total Expenses  710.00   (500 grocery + 45 phone + 165 payment leg)
        Net Cash Flow  -710.00
        On other accts   45.00   (the card's expense less its income;
                                  its payment leg is the FAR leg, excluded)
        checking moves -665.00 = -710.00 + 45.00

    and with the CARD as the balance line, the same paycheck seen from the
    card::

        Total Income    165.00   (the payment, now the near leg)
        Total Expenses  545.00   (500 grocery + 45 phone)
        Net Cash Flow  -380.00
        On other accts  500.00   (checking's expense less its income; ITS
                                  payment leg is now the far leg)
        the card moves  120.00 = -380.00 + 500.00

    Every row is placed PROJECTED in a paycheck that opens after the pass's
    ``as_of`` (asserted, not assumed: the fixture's periods 0-3 are PAST, and
    ruling R-G's clamp lands a past-period plan row on ``as_of + 1``, in
    today's column, which the identity absorbs through ``period_timing`` and
    a hand delta on the row's own column would not see), so each row lands on
    its own day and the column's balance delta is exactly the rows'.

    **What grades what.**  The identity oracle cannot grade the composition:
    ``net`` and ``elsewhere`` are built from the same other-member legs, so
    ``net + elsewhere`` is the balance account's own net ALGEBRAICALLY,
    whatever those legs hold -- the leaf's adversarial review named this.  The
    composition is graded two ways instead: the hand figures on the fixture
    column, and
    ``test_the_composition_is_each_members_own_cash_column_over_the_window``,
    which reads every member's OWN column off :func:`period_view_of` (the
    pre-CC-4-1 producer, an independent path) and checks every column of the
    window against it.

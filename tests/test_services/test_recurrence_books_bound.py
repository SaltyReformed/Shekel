"""A recurring definition names no occurrence below its accounts' books.

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``.

**The rule, in one sentence** (rulings **R-PC85** and **R-PC86**, developer
2026-09-22): a recurring definition's occurrences run from the LATER of its
own first occurrence and the day after the books open on every account it
moves money in, and the day compared is the ROW's cash day -- its due day --
with a day ON the opening inside it (ruling **R-HG**).

**Why it needed stating at all** -- measured on a production clone before the
step: nothing said "no books before an account opens".  An occurrence with no
paycheck to land in is skipped, so the owner's first payday (2026-03-26) stood
in for the books, and a paycheck recorded at 2026-03-12 let the rules fill it:
a ``$531.94`` Van Payment on 03-22 and a ``$100.00`` birthday on 03-24, both
before Checking's books, moving 112 of 4,745 figures by exactly ``-$631.94``.

What each class covers:

* :class:`TestTheWalkStopsAtTheBooks` -- the pure walk.  One composition
  (``recurrence._placement._placements``) serves both public walks, and these
  pin both, at the boundary from both sides.
* :class:`TestWhatTheBooksDrop` -- ``placements_below_the_books``, the walk's
  answer to what the floor removed, which the doors refusing to strand a row
  ask (rulings R-PC88 / R-PC90 / R-PC91).
* :class:`TestTheCashDayIsCompared` -- ruling R-PC86: a bill scheduled before
  the books but due after them is kept; one due ON the opening is not.
* :class:`TestTheRowDateIsOneDerivation` -- the day the walk bounds by and the
  day ``compute_due_date`` stamps on the row are one body
  (``recurrence._row_day.date_row``); graded against the rule-row reading.
* :class:`TestTheFloorIsTheAccounts` -- the read pass composes the floor from
  every account the definition moves money in, and the pure resolver leaves
  it empty.
* :class:`TestGenerationStopsAtTheBooks` -- the regression PC-500 named: a
  pay period below an account's books is filled with nothing for it.
* :class:`TestTheBooksNeverEndTheRule` -- ruling **R-PC94**: an occurrence the
  books drop still spends a count bound, so an "after N times" rule ends
  where it did before the books bound (the round-2 review's H-A).

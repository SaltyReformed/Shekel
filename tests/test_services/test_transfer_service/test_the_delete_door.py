# ── Delete Tests ───────────────────────────────────────────────────


class TestDeleteTransfer:
    """``transfer_service.delete_transfer``, one case per state and kind of delete.

    A delete case is set by two things: the transfer's state before the
    delete (planned, paid, or already hidden) and which delete runs (a soft
    delete HIDES it, a hard delete removes it for good).  Each case checks
    what that delete must leave behind (ruling R-BAL290 part 2, the
    developer, 2026-10-14).  The group has been laid out this way since plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``'s checkpoint 2e-2b-2a, which merged two groups
    into it: ``TestSoftDeleteHandling`` (the already-hidden cases) and
    ``TestADeleteReturnsAPaidTransferToAPlan`` (the paid cases).

    - PLANNED: hidden (:meth:`test_soft_hides_the_transfer`), or removed
      (:meth:`test_hard_removes_the_transfer`).
    - PAID: hidden.  The delete that takes a Paid transfer's payment records
      off (ruling credit_card:R-CC75) also sets it back to Projected, so a
      restore brings back a plan, never a ``$0.00`` close, which a loan reads
      as a missed installment (ruling R-BAL246, the developer 2026-10-09,
      "Back as a plan, now";
      :meth:`test_a_paid_transfer_comes_off_as_a_hidden_plan_and_restores_as_one`).
      The set-back has two edges: a ``$0.00`` close held nothing and keeps
      Paid (:meth:`test_a_zero_close_held_nothing_and_keeps_paid`), and a
      Cancelled transfer whose kept records came off stays Cancelled
      (:meth:`test_a_cancelled_transfer_whose_kept_records_came_off_stays_cancelled`).
      A paid transfer REMOVED for good is graded in two other files and is
      not written again here: ``test_transfer_posting_lifecycle.py``'s
      ``TestDeleteAndRestore::test_hard_delete_settled_reverses_and_pairs_survive_null_links``
      (the row is gone, its posted legs reversed) and
      ``test_cc5_4a3_movement_removal.py``'s
      ``TestEveryDoorWithdrawsTheActItself`` case
      ``test_a_hard_transfer_delete_withdraws_the_act_naming_its_leg`` (the
      statement match its payment was in is withdrawn).  That the row
      is gone is the first one's alone: a hard delete that kept a transfer
      whose sides held a payment failed it and no case in this file
      (measured at checkpoint 2e-2b-2a).
    - ALREADY HIDDEN: hidden again
      (:meth:`test_delete_soft_deleted_transfer_is_idempotent`), or removed
      (:meth:`test_hard_delete_soft_deleted_transfer_succeeds`, a planned
      transfer hidden first; a PAID one hidden and then removed is
      ``test_transfer_posting_lifecycle.py``'s ``TestDeleteAndRestore`` case
      ``test_hard_delete_of_a_soft_deleted_pair_finds_the_ledger_at_zero``).
    - Someone else's transfer, live or already hidden: not found, on either
      delete, and re-read after a COMMIT still there and still live or
      still hidden (:meth:`test_wrong_user_rejected`,
      :meth:`test_someone_elses_hidden_transfer_is_not_found`).  No transfer
      at all: not found, on the hard delete
      (:meth:`test_nonexistent_rejected`).

    Every case here holds an AD-HOC transfer.  The shape production hides
    is a transfer of a definition (the instance delete hides a linked
    transfer and removes an ad-hoc one; the template archive hides only
    linked ones), and a hide that skipped a linked transfer passes this
    group: it is graded at the route tier, by ``test_routes/test_transfers/``
    ``test_instance.py``'s ``test_delete_template_transfer_soft_deletes``
    among others (measured at checkpoint 2e-2b-2a's review).

    Editing a hidden transfer answers not found too, which is an EDIT
    refusal: :class:`TestUpdateTransfer`'s
    ``test_update_soft_deleted_transfer_raises_not_found``.  The paid cases
    read each side's record by its own SQL
    (:func:`tests._test_helpers.transfer_side_record`), never the producer.

        create refuses either member of the settled band (Paid and Received)

        **Asked of both ways a transfer is priced**: an ad-hoc transfer owning
        its figure, and one priced by its template, which states no figure.
        The second is the state the deleted figure-less refusal stood guard
        over: a refusal asked only of a spec owning a figure lets it through
        to commit Paid with neither side holding a record, the ``$0.00`` close
        ruling **R-BAL82** names, and every other case in this package passes
        (measured by 4d-4a's review, its mutant D).  The template-priced spec
        carries the template link, due date and occurrence the engine's own
        spec does (``transfer_recurrence``), so nothing but the status stands

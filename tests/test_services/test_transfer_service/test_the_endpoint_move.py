    """``update_transfer``'s ENDPOINT arm (plan step R10-b).

    A transfer's source and destination are two of the six columns a recurring
    definition states, and this door could write only four of them -- so a
    definition's account change reached its generated rows by DESTROYING and
    re-creating every one of them, and a NON-repeating transfer refused the same
    edit outright because nothing could carry it.  The arm moves the transfer
    and reconciles the ledger on both sides of the move.  Until plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` its two legs were two shadow rows, which the arm
    re-pointed and re-named (that upkeep is deleted at the step's leaf 3b);
    each is derived from the transfer's endpoints now.  So a case that grades
    where the move LEFT the transfer reads the endpoint columns of the row
    re-read from the database since that step's checkpoint 2e-2b-1b-3, where
    it read the session's columns and, in five of the six, legs' accounts or
    labels (ruling R-BAL290 part 1).  Which endpoint each side is on is
    ``test_transfer_legs/test_what_a_side_shows.py``'s ``TestLegOf`` and its
    ``TestBothSidesShowTheTransfer``, and each side's label, composed from
    the endpoints' current names, its ``TestALegsDisplayProjections``.  A
    ledger case that reads the transfer reads the session's row after the
    update's own flush, as the reconcile inside the update does, and
    :meth:`test_moving_a_settled_payment_ONTO_a_loan_reconciles_that_loan`'s
    relationship read is the firing control for a move that assigns the
    foreign key and not the relationship, which a re-read row cannot be: it
    loads the relationship by that column.

        It renamed the destination account and then asserted the edit left

        re-write of stored names gated on a real move, which goes with that
        arm at the step's leaf 3b.

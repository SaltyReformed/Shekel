class TestRestoreTransfer:
    """``transfer_service.restore_transfer``: a hidden transfer comes back unhidden, unchanged.

    A restore brings a hidden transfer back unhidden, its amount, status and
    pay period unchanged and back in both accounts' plans; refuses while
    either account is archived, leaving the transfer hidden; and answers not
    found for someone else's transfer or none (ruling R-BAL290 part 3, the
    developer, 2026-10-14, "Delete the seven").  Each case that reads the
    transfer reads the row re-read from the database since plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``'s checkpoint 2e-2b-2b, where they read the
    object in the session and the transfer's two shadow rows (ruling
    R-BAL290 part 1).  The nonexistent-transfer case and the both-archived
    refusal read no row; the wrong-owner case reads it after the refusal
    and after the owner's restore since that step's vacuous-residue
    checkpoint.  "Unchanged" is the ruling's three fields: no case here
    reads a restored transfer's due date, category, override flag or notes,
    and a restore that moved its due date or cleared its category fails
    none (measured by the review of that checkpoint).

    Every case holds an AD-HOC transfer.  The shape production restores is
    a transfer of a definition (un-archiving a template restores its
    transfers), and a restore that un-hid ad-hoc transfers only fails six
    route cases (two in the templates' route tests, two in
    ``test_archived_rows_bound_the_books.py``, one each in
    ``test_archived_definition_edit.py`` and
    ``test_a_revert_below_the_books.py``; measured by that review).  A PAID transfer
    hidden and restored comes back a plan, and a ``$0.00`` close comes back
    Paid: :class:`TestDeleteTransfer`'s
    ``test_a_paid_transfer_comes_off_as_a_hidden_plan_and_restores_as_one``
    and ``test_a_zero_close_held_nothing_and_keeps_paid`` (ruling R-BAL246).

    Eight cases were deleted at that checkpoint.  Seven planted a WRONG
    value on a hidden transfer's stored side row and checked that the
    restore repaired it or that nothing read it:
    ``test_repairable_status_drift_is_still_repaired``,
    ``test_a_repair_into_a_projected_status_clears_the_instant`` and
    ``test_corrects_drifted_shadow_status`` (its status),
    ``test_corrects_drifted_shadow_due_date``,
    ``test_corrects_drifted_shadow_category``,
    ``test_corrects_drifted_shadow_is_override`` and
    ``test_a_shadow_amount_CANNOT_drift_from_its_transfer`` (its amount).
    No side row can be stored since that step's create door
    (``ck_transactions_names_no_transfer``, ruling R-BAL258), so there is
    nothing to plant; the refusal is ``test_a_transfer_is_one_row.py``'s
    ``test_the_database_refuses_a_twin`` (the expense side) and
    ``test_a_transfer_shadow_is_derived.py``'s
    ``test_the_transfer_owns_its_figure_and_neither_twin_can_be_stored``
    (both sides) until plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-5`` deletes the column
    it guards.  The eighth,
    ``test_raises_on_missing_shadows``, asked the restore to refuse a
    transfer with no side rows, which every transfer is now (ruling
    R-BAL273, "Delete it").

    Three of the seven also read a side of the restored transfer as the grid
    draws it, and the amount case priced both shadow rows (none of those
    reads ran after that step's create door: each case failed at its
    plant).  The restored transfer's amount is
    :meth:`test_restores_transfer_and_shadows`'s, and what a side shows of
    it ``test_transfer_legs/test_what_a_side_shows.py``'s ``TestBothSidesShowTheTransfer``.  Each
    state the side reads asked is asked elsewhere, failing under a mutant
    gated on that state and side (measured at that checkpoint), with one
    exception.  A restored ``$0.00`` close's side reads Paid: on the expense
    side, ``test_transfer_legs/test_the_grids_legs.py``'s ``TestTheLegMapProducers`` and
    ``TestTheLegContributionTwins`` cases
    ``test_a_settled_leg_with_no_movement_is_the_zero_record`` and
    ``test_routes/test_a_zero_close_has_no_day.py``.  On the INCOME side no
    case reads it: the mutant fails only ``test_loan_settled_legs.py``'s
    loan payments, each while building its data rather than at a read of
    the side, and limited to a destination that is not a loan it fails
    none (measured by the review of that checkpoint).  The close's own
    Paid is :class:`TestDeleteTransfer`'s
    ``test_a_zero_close_held_nothing_and_keeps_paid``.  A restored planned
    transfer's sides read Projected:
    ``test_transfer_legs/test_what_a_side_shows.py``'s
    ``TestBothSidesShowTheTransfer``, each side.  They hold no settle day:
    ``test_transfer_legs/test_the_grids_legs.py``'s
    ``test_a_planned_and_an_undated_leg_answer_none`` on the expense side,
    and ``test_statement_match/test_leg_candidates.py``'s
    ``test_each_side_is_offered_on_its_own_account_keyed_by_the_transfer``
    on the income side.

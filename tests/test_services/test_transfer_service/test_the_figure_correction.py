    DAY was correctable in place (ruling **R-ED**) while its FIGURE was refused

    and a revert RETAINS the recorded figure, so the re-settle re-booked the old
    number over the re-planned one (developer ruling, 2026-08-17).

    The route DROPS a figure that arrives with an unsettling status (ruling

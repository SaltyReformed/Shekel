"""C9b (ruling R-C): a loan cannot receive a payment before it originates.

A payment whose INSTALLMENT falls at or before a loan's origination is erased by
the fold -- it splits against a running balance of zero, so it books $0.00
principal and the whole cash routes to a Refund Receivable, after which the
origination anchor resets the balance over the top of it.  The cash still leaves
the funding account.  Net: the money is gone, the loan is untouched, and the app
models the lender as owing it back (finding FU-5, measured at $1,200.00).

The developer ruled this REJECTED at the transfer write boundary rather than
modeled as a prepayment or left to fail loud on read.  These tests pin the
boundary (which is ``<=``, not ``<``), both write paths (create AND the edit that
could move an existing payment backwards), and the cases that must stay allowed.

All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

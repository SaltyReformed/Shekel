"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-3``: a payment leaves the books through ONE act.

Ruling **R-CC54** (developer 2026-09-22), its first part: *"ONE act takes a
payment or purchase off the books: it reverses its ledger, takes it out of any
match (withdrawing a match left with nothing and saying which bank line that
freed), then deletes it.  Every door calls it, including the popover's two
paths."*  Finding **CC-358** is the door that did not: the status seam deleted
a matched payment on a ``$0.00`` or ``purchases`` record and asked no match,
so the act kept its bank line alone -- the review screen called the line
unexplained, the day drill-down called it matched, and matching it again raised
``IntegrityError`` on ``uq_statement_match_members_line``.

The two seam classes are FIRING controls against that tree -- each asserts a
state the old seam could not produce (the act gone, the line re-matchable, the
withdrawal logged), through the production doors:
``transaction_service.apply_requested_status`` for the popover's ``$0.00``,
``settle_transaction`` for Paid on a row whose purchases replace its payment.
The group case beside them is a REGRESSION pin, and says so; the last class
grades the act itself -- its return is its read's, and a surviving act's
loaded members agree with the table.

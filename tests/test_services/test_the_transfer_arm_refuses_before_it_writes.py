"""Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` checkpoint 2b: the Transfer arm's refusals, and the moves it carries.

The fixes the neutral review of checkpoint 2a asked for, and the developer's
four answers to it (2026-10-08), each graded through a public door of
:mod:`app.services.transfer_service` (or, where only a writer around the doors
can reach the state, through the status seam itself) and read back as STORED:

* a day typed on a pair closed at ``$0.00`` is refused with the developer's
  sentence, where it was accepted and dropped (ruling **R-BAL230**, review M1);
* a corrected ``$0.00`` close is dated by its due date but never after today
  (ruling **R-BAL231**, amending R-BAL169; review M3);
* the arm grades BOTH sides' days against their books before it writes
  either, so a refused settle stages no record (review L1);
* a hidden transfer is refused by its name, or "Transfer" when it has none,
  and "was archived" when its definition is (finding **BAL-547**);
* a transfer whose twin row was deleted behind the app's back settles like
  any other (ruling **R-BAL235**, retiring R-BAL148 / R-BAL158);
* a page that NAMES a matched record's bank line frees it for an endpoint
  move and for the occurrence delete, and logs it (ruling **R-BAL229**'s
  positive path, review L5);
* an endpoint move moves the side's money in the posted ledger (design D5's
  money, review L5);
* the band rule refuses a writer around the doors that deletes one side's
  record of a Paid transfer, or re-links it to another transfer (design D8,
  review L5).

Shekel Budget App -- Cash ledger: what a SET of rows SUMS TO.

The Projected-only ``(income, expense)`` reduction of
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.sum_projected`, tested against that function
directly.  Its sibling :mod:`tests.test_services.test_cash_amounts` grades what
ONE row is worth; this grades which rows are counted at all, and on which leg.

**These tests MOVED here at plan step X-c2c2b**
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``), from
``test_balance_calculator_entries.py`` (which then had nothing left to hold and
deleted) and ``test_balance_resolver.py``.  They always tested THIS rule; they
reached it through ``balance_at._calculator.calculate_balances``, a PRODUCER
that deletes at plan step X-c2c4, so every assertion read
``anchor +/- the reduction`` and the anchor arithmetic was scenery.  **Every
hand-computed figure is preserved verbatim** -- each test states the reduction
it now asserts and the balance it used to assert, so the two forms can be
diffed against each other.

Two questions this file does NOT answer, and their homes:

* what one row is WORTH -- ``test_cash_amounts.py``;
* which STARTING balance the reduction is added to, and whether the anchor
  period and a post-anchor period both apply it -- that is
  ``balance_at._calculator``'s roll-forward, graded in
  ``test_balance_calculator.py`` until that module deletes.

The rule under test: only rows the shared ``is_projected`` predicate admits
contribute; income counts at :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contribution_of`
and expense at the entries-aware reservation, and the split follows the
transaction TYPE.

**The basis is a REQUIRED argument since plan step S1-c** (ruling R-DH (d)).
``sum_projected`` took one optional ``amount_overrides`` map defaulting to
``None``, and one optional argument is one way for a caller to hand this
reduction half a basis.  Every call below therefore states its
:class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis` explicitly.

**It was a ``ProjectedBasis`` carrying the account's clearing rule until plan
step X-f3b** (ruling **R-FM**), and the day that record stated was what decided
which bucket each purchase fell in.  A purchase's own ``settled_on`` decides it
now, so every fixture below says the bucket it means at the entry rather than
in a basis one screen away.

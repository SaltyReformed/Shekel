"""The ONE writer of a row's amount-ownership pair.

Plan step **X-au-g-2c-2**.  ``app.services.amount_ownership`` is the write half
of ruling **R-FI**: a row either STATES ITS OWN figure or DECLARES the relation
that prices it, and the two columns that say which move together or not at all.
:mod:`app.services.cash_ledger._amount_source` is the read half, graded in
``tests/test_services/test_amount_source.py``; the schema's own refusals are
graded in ``tests/test_models/test_amount_ownership.py``.

**What is asserted here is that the SEAM cannot express the half-write**, not
that the CHECK refuses it -- the constraint's tests already own that.  The
difference matters: a constraint catches a mistake at the flush, and this seam
is what stops the mistake being writable at all.

    **The registry is GONE at plan step X-au-k, and this is what replaced it.**
    The seam carried a ``{model: figure column name}`` dict because a
    transaction stores an owned figure in ``estimated_amount`` and a transfer
    in ``amount``, so an act had to look up which column to write; both models
    expose the pair under the SAME attribute now, so there is nothing to
    dispatch on and nothing to keep in step.  What the dict also bought was a
    COMPLETENESS predicate -- a third table brought under the amount model
    would fail loudly rather than be written through a default -- and that
    predicate is worth more than the dispatch was, so it is restated here
    against the MAPPERS instead of against a hand-written dict.

    It is strictly stronger than the version it replaces, for a reason the old
    file's own second test named: ``setattr`` on a declarative class does not
    fail, so a model that carried ``amount_source_id`` without the composite
    would take an ``amount_ownership`` assignment, put it nowhere, and let the
    ``commit`` after it succeed.  A census over ``mapper.composites`` cannot be
    satisfied that way -- an unmapped instance attribute never appears there.

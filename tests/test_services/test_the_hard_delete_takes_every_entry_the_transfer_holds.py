"""The transfer's hard delete takes EVERY entry the transfer holds (leaf ``X-bi-6-4d-1``).

The transfer's hard delete hands the one removal act every entry its transfer
holds, and since leaf ``X-bi-6-4d-1`` it asks
``transfer_legs.held_transfer_entries`` for them rather than walking each
shadow's ``entries`` -- so ``X-bi-6-4d``'s re-parent moves the collection with
the join.  These cases grade the SCOPE that swap claims to keep, not the swap
itself (they pass on the old per-shadow walk too, by design).  Since plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` the scope is ANY record on either side of the
transfer, whatever its shadows are, because that is what the side keys (NO
ACTION, ruling **R-CC64**) refuse the transfer's delete for; it was any entry
under any shadow, live or dead, under ``fk_transaction_entries_transaction_id``
until then.  A kept, un-dated record a revert left behind counts, and so does
one whose shadows are hidden (finding **BAL-532**'s neighbour: a transfer
hidden holding one is refused by the database since that step).  A collection
narrowed to dated movements, or to live shadows, leaves such a record behind
and the delete fails at the flush.  The suite graded neither before this leaf.

"""The transfer's hard delete takes EVERY entry the transfer holds (leaf ``X-bi-6-4d-1``).

The transfer's hard delete hands the one removal act every entry its transfer
holds, and since leaf ``X-bi-6-4d-1`` it asks
``transfer_legs.held_transfer_entries`` for them rather than walking each
shadow's ``entries`` -- so ``X-bi-6-4d``'s re-parent moves the collection with
the join.  The case grades the SCOPE that swap claims to keep, not the swap
itself (it passes on the old per-shadow walk too, by design).  Since plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` the scope is ANY record on either side of the
transfer, because that is what the side keys (NO ACTION, ruling **R-CC64**)
refuse the transfer's delete for; it was any entry under any shadow, live or
dead, under ``fk_transaction_entries_transaction_id`` until then.  A kept,
un-dated record a revert left behind counts: a collection narrowed to dated
movements, or to one side's, leaves such a record behind and the delete fails
at the flush.  The suite graded none of that before this leaf.

A second case hid both shadows over the two kept records first, until plan
step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``'s vacuous-residue checkpoint deleted it (ruling
**R-BAL325**, the developer, 2026-10-19).  From that step's create door on a
transfer has no shadow to hide, so its two hides touched no row, and each half
of what was left is graded elsewhere: the database's refusal of a transfer
hidden holding a record is ``test_transfer_side_links.py``'s
``TestTheDeletedRowTransferArm::test_hiding_a_transfer_that_holds_a_record_is_refused_at_commit``,
and the hard delete after that refusal, which met the state the case below
builds, is the case below (measured there: with the refusal switched off the
first fails, and with the delete skipping the un-dated records, or either
side's, the second does).

"""X-g1 / X-g4b: the modelled replay against an INDEPENDENT engine.

Plan steps X-g1 and X-g4b (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).

**This file was a PARALLEL RUN and is no longer one** (ruling R-AU).  It ran the
modelled replay beside the three producers plan step X-g2b replaced and
CLASSIFIED every divergence into three named classes -- the reverse projection
contradicting the user's own assertions (findings N-43 / N-74), the anchor
period earning nothing (ruling R-Y), and the per-DAY versus per-PERIOD grain
(ruling R-T).  Plan step X-g4b deleted those producers, so three of the five
classes here had no reference left to compare against and went with them; what
they measured is recorded in ``archive/cash_arc_as_built_2026-07-27.md``.

**What SURVIVES is the half that never graded against the incumbent**, and it is
kept as its own file rather than folded into ``test_asset_fold.py`` because it
is a different KIND of evidence (plan Section 7.2's independence rule):

* :class:`TestTheGrainIsARegroupingNotADifferentModel` grades the replay against
  ``growth_engine.project_balance`` -- the pure math engine ruling R-U
  deliberately KEEPS for the what-if surfaces, and which no balance path reads.
  On a shape isolating the grain (assertion on the anchor period's LAST day, no
  contribution feed), the daily replay tracks the per-PERIOD engine to within a
  CENT on every post-anchor period: ``period_return_rate`` over a 14-day span is
  ``(1 + annual) ** (14/365) - 1``, the 14th power of the one-day rate the
  replay applies, so the two compound the SAME curve and differ only where
  cent-rounding lands.  That is what shows the replay is one model read at a
  finer grain rather than a second opinion.
* :class:`TestTheTwoGrainsAreOneRunningTotal` asserts properties of the replay
  ALONE: a scalar at a date, a daily series and the per-period map are three
  readings of ONE resolved step list.

``test_asset_fold.py`` beside this grades the replay on HAND-COMPUTED figures.
Neither file grades it against a shipping producer, which is finding N-7's rule.

No sampling: the every-day class walks all 140 days of the seeded horizon
(a 14-day sample once scored perfect while wrong by $178,103.41 on 22% of days).

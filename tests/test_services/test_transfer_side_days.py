"""Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``: each side of a transfer keeps its own day.

The pure day function (``transfer_service._side_days``, ruling **R-BAL142**)
and the evidence predicate it asks (:func:`app.services.settle_day.is_evidence`,
the REC-552 study's seam S1).  A side with evidence of its own -- the bank
showed it, a balance was asserted over it, or the owner typed it -- keeps that
day; a side with none BORROWS the other side's, and follows it when that day
is corrected; when neither side has one, both borrow the day Paid was pressed.

Everything here is values in, values out: no database, no clock.  The writer
that feeds the function its inputs, and the doors that state days, are graded
in ``test_each_side_keeps_its_own_day.py``.

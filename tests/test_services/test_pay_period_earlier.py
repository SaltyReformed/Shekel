"""Tests for "Add earlier paychecks" (plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-b``).

Ruling **R-PC87**: an action beside Extend asks only how many paychecks to add
before the owner's first and records the paydays their earliest rhythm projects
just below it.  Ruling **R-PC105** (narrowing R-PC87's "moves nothing" to
paychecks): it moves that rhythm's phase down to the earliest payday it adds,
the same rhythm on the same grid.  Ruling **R-PC104**: a payday below a STATED
history is refused, by the one predicate the history setter asks.  Ruling
**R-PC103**: the forms that state a start keep their date check, with one
message per case.

Four contracts, one class each:

* the PRODUCER (``pay_calendar.earlier_paydays``) -- pure, over every cadence
  kind and convention: the days are the backward count's, and the re-phased
  era plans every payday it planned before;
* the REFUSAL a stated form meets (``pay_period_batch.reject_backward_payday``)
  -- the two messages, and the inside case's span taken from the derivation;
* the WRITER and ADMIN doors (``pay_period_write.prepend_paydays``,
  ``pay_period_admin.add_earlier_pay_periods``) -- what they record, what they
  move, what they refuse and that a refusal writes nothing -- and the era
  writer's own bounds (``pay_era_write.rephase_earliest_era`` moves the phase
  only along the era's own grid, and up only as far as the era still pays --
  ruling **R-PC110**, plan step ``C21``, whose door is graded in
  ``test_pay_period_remove_earlier.py``);
* the HAZARD R-PC105 exists for -- a regenerate keeping only earlier paychecks
  restating a rhythm from the old phase or just past it -- driven through the
  real doors.

``POST /pay-periods/earlier`` is graded in
``tests/test_routes/test_pay_periods_earlier.py``.

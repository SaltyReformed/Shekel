Shekel Budget App -- Tax Config Service Tests

Verifies which year of the tax law each kind resolves for a profile -- federal
rules, state rules and FICA, each on its own series -- and that the answer
reads no clock.  The law is :mod:`app.tax_law`; each test here installs the
made-up law it reasons about through the ``tax_law`` fixture (ruling
salary:R-SAL80), so no case moves when a real year is published.

"""The loan replay over ONE stream: facts, then projections (recurrence:R16-c-1).

Plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1** (ruling **R-R90**) merges a loan's recorded
past and its projected future into one :class:`LoanEventStream`, replayed once
from one seed.  Two rules the merge introduces are observable ONLY on a
hand-built stream on this tree, and each is pinned here rather than left to the
step that first makes it reachable on live data:

* **A RESET clears whatever charges stand before it** (ruling **R-R72** part
  (2)).  Reachable on live data since plan step ``recurrence:R16-c-2``, which
  charges every contractual installment from origination, so a skipped
  month's charge meets a true-up.  (The what-if extra cannot meet one at all:
  it accrues at the charges on or after the projection boundary only, and
  those walk behind every recorded fact.)
* **A projection is never placed before a recorded fact**
  (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.projection_boundary`).  The recorded
  payments' splits are a function of the facts alone, whether or not the plan
  follows them, which is what lets the posted ledger and a screen agree on
  every settled payment.
* **A loan's FIRST tracking start clears the months before it one by one**
  (ruling **R-R117**), so a payment the start holds pays its own month alone
  -- in every shape pinned here, exactly as the app splits it where only the
  months holding a payment are charged (not in every shape: an early extra
  before the first installment differs by step R16-c-2's own pairing); a
  true-up, and a start dated after another balance, keep the reset's own
  clearing.
* **That start charges the month it lands in on its own figure when that
  month's payment walks after it** (ruling **R-R118**): a payment due off
  the contractual day, after the start but inside the standing installment's
  interval, pays that month's interest on the start's balance, recorded or
  planned, where a Record balance in the same place still clears it (R-R72
  part (2)) and the payment pays pure principal -- in the ruling's words,
  "$102.52 less interest than today's app", by design.

Pure: no database, no app context.  Every figure is stated by hand and checked
against :func:`~app.utils.money.accrue_monthly_interest` /
:func:`~app.utils.money.apply_payment_cash`, the ONE accrual and the ONE
allocation.

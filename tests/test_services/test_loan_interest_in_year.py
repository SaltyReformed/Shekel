"""C3c: balance_at.loan_interest_in_year -- interest PAID in a year, one producer.

Plan step **C3c** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  Direct unit
coverage of the balance seam's ONE loan-interest producer, which replaced the
ledger-reader-plus-schedule HYBRID that lived in ``tax_report_service``
(``_compute_mortgage_interest`` / ``_loan_year_interest``, both deleted).  The LIVE
Schedule-A wiring and hand-computed value stay in ``test_tax_report_service.py``
(``TestScheduleAMortgageInterest``); these pin the producer's INTERNALS the live
value test alone does not reach:

* the SETTLED (past) interest is the FOLD's actual per-payment figure -- correct
  for an off-schedule payment where the schedule replay is not -- attributed to
  each payment's DISPLAY-timezone civil paid YEAR (the L9 tax basis, which diverges
  from the balance ledger's UTC clock across the New Year);
* the PROJECTED (future) interest is folded from the loan's forward payment PLAN
  (step C6c), the SAME plan the projected BALANCE folds -- an early-settled
  installment counts once because the plan excludes its slot BY CONSTRUCTION (the
  C3c schedule-slot merge is gone; the de-dup lives in ``loan_plan``);
* the figure comes from the loan's SOURCE events, so it answers even for a loan the
  posting cache cannot value (no genesis opening posting) -- closing B-6, where the
  old hybrid fell back to the schedule and reported the wrong number.

Relocated from the retired ``test_tax_mortgage_interest.py`` (which tested the
deleted hybrid); the value assertions are hand-computed, never the producer as its
own oracle (plan N-7).

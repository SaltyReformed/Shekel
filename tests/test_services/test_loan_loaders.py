"""Tests for the loan data-loader leaf (anchor-fact synthesis).

:mod:`app.services.loan_loaders` is the leaf layer every loan consumer loads
through.  These tests pin its C11 centerpiece --

loader the genesis posting walk and every resolver-input builder share: the
origination anchor is SYNTHESIZED from the immutable :class:`LoanParams` and is

retired), while stored ``tracking_start`` and ``user_trueup`` events load as
non-opening balance ASSERTIONS, and legacy stored origination rows are ignored
(they were always verbatim copies of the params, verified on production
data).

All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

"""What the statements page reads, and the scoping nothing was watching.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6a-1**.  ``_reads.py`` had NO test at all until an
adversarial review said so: four public functions, three of them carrying an
``account_id`` filter, and the only coverage was four static-string assertions
in the route test.

**The scoping tests are the point.**  Deleting the ``account_id`` filter from
any of the three readers left every other test in the branch green -- while the
page rendered another account's bank descriptions, days, amounts and running
balances.  That is a disclosure of exactly the material this leaf exists to
record, and the route's 404 tests cannot see it: they prove you cannot ADDRESS
another account's page, not that your own page shows only your own lines.

``recorded_span``'s ``net_amount`` is the other hole they name: it is a money
figure rendered to the user and it was asserted nowhere, so summing absolute
values instead of signed ones would have gone unnoticed.

        re-labelling the row in a migration and in the seed file together; this
        is what makes the pair verifiable rather than a convention.  The test
        database is migration-built and then reseeded, so the stored value is
        the MIGRATION's -- which is precisely why comparing it against the
        SEED file catches the half that would otherwise be graded nowhere.

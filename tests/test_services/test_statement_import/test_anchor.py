"""Which day is a statement's stated balance for, and how firmly is it held?

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6e-1**, ruling **R-GF**.  A bank writes its balance
as of the EXPORT INSTANT and labels it with the export's own day, so the header
day is not the day the figure is for -- and the file's own lines are what solve
it.

**Every case below is a shape MEASURED on the developer's real exports**, and
each one is a different answer, which is why the arms are separable at all:

* 2026-08-22 -- header ``2459.60`` as of 08-22, last line 08-21, solves at
  08-21.  The ordinary export.
* 2026-08-16 -- header ``4747.63`` as of 08-16 over a file listing two 08-14
  lines worth ``-1006.72``; the figure is 08-13's closing and solves there.
  The LAG.
* 2026-01-02..2026-03-31 pulled 2026-08-23 -- header ``2459.60`` as of 08-23,
  145 days past the last line and ``$255.41`` from the ``$2,715.01`` its own
  139 lines imply.  Solves nowhere, and refusing it would reject an honest
  export.  The RANGE.

**The refusal arm is a FIRING CONTROL** (``docs/plans/verification.md``
standard 4): nothing in ordinary use reaches it, because the only files that do
are ones whose own running-balance chain contradicts their own header, so a
test asserting only that good files pass would pass equally against a solver
that never refused.

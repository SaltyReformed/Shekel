"""A line's identity: what the bank stated, and the surrogate the app mints.

Plan steps **bank_import:X-f6a-1** and **X-f6a-4**.  Ruling **R-FP** named
``FITID`` as the idempotency key; measurement 2026-08-16 refined that to a
POSITIONAL key -- ``(account, posted_on, amount, sequence within that group)``
-- because only some sources carry an id of their own, and across two SECU
exports twelve days apart the positional key reproduced the ``FITID`` key
exactly over 342 shared lines.

**The ordinal is the part that is not obvious, and it carries money in BOTH
directions.**  Without it, a second genuinely distinct charge sharing a day and
an amount -- the same coffee twice -- would be recognised as a duplicate of the
first and silently dropped: money the bank took and the app never recorded, on
the very mechanism built to prevent double-recording.

**And COMPARING against it is the defect X-f6a-4 removes.**  Three of the key's
four terms are facts the bank stated; the ordinal is not, and a re-import that
asked "what sits at this ordinal" refused a whole file on two events the bank
had not restated at all.  Both are reproduced here as firing controls, against
the pairing that now decides:

* a re-ordered pair of same-day same-amount lines -- the bank lists a day's
  card debits by ascending magnitude and ties have no stated tiebreak;
* a genuinely NEW line the bank INSERTED ahead of a recorded one.  The
  insertion behaviour is OBSERVED rather than hypothetical: it is why
  ``_record._refuse_restatement`` stopped comparing running balances.

What must still refuse is a genuine restatement, and that is graded here too.

"""The SECU CSV adapter reads what the bank wrote, and refuses what it did not.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6a-1**, ruling **R-FP**.  The adapter is the only
place in the importer that knows a format, so every quirk of the real export is
graded here rather than downstream.

**Most of these are FIRING CONTROLS** (``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard
4): each writes the file shape the adapter is supposed to refuse and asserts the
refusal.  The one that matters most is the TOTALS row -- SECU appends a summary
line whose Credit and Debit cells hold the file's whole-year sums, and an adapter
that did not recognise it would import a fabricated ``+$43,597.96`` /
``-$43,213.56`` movement dated nowhere.  That is not a hypothetical: it is the
last row of the developer's own export, and the first draft of this adapter's
measurement harness read it as a transaction.

"""The sighting relation's rules: pairing within a source, and the line's reads.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-1``, ruling **R-BI10**.  A line is the bank's
fact; what each import said about it is that import's sighting; the record
door pairs an incoming line to a recorded one WITHIN A SOURCE -- by the
source's own id, then by its wording, then by count against the lines only
other sources showed -- and what is left is new.  These cases grade that rule
step by step, the refusal's reach after it, the door's one-id-one-line
refusal, and the two order claims the line's reads make (LATEST sighting for
the wording, EARLIEST stated day for the transaction day) with a two-element
case where id order and the claimed order disagree.

**The id step and the cross-source step are reached through
:func:`~app.services.statement_import._record._pair_group` directly**, the
allowance ``test_anchor`` takes for ``resting_on``: the one adapter that
exists carries no ids and there is one source, so no file can put either
shape through the door.  The rows are still real -- built through the ORM,
sightings and imports loaded the way the door loads them -- so the pairing is
graded over the eager collection and the act order it actually reads.

"""The statement must agree with itself before the app believes it.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6a-1**.  A source carrying a per-line running balance
states the same account twice -- once as a sequence of amounts, once as a
sequence of balances -- and the two must agree.  That redundancy is the only
self-check the app has over a record it did not author.

**Every refusal here is a FIRING CONTROL** (``docs/plans/verification.md``
standard 4): the chain holds on 305 of 305 consecutive pairs of the developer's
real export, so nothing in ordinary use exercises the failure arm, and a test
that only asserted a good file passes would pass equally against a checker that
returned unconditionally.  Each test below plants the break and asserts the
refusal.

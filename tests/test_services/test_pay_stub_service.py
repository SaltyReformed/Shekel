"""
Shekel Budget App -- the pay stub entry door's service (plan step salary:S11-b).

What :mod:`app.services.pay_stub_service` decides, graded without a request:

* which dates can carry a stub -- a payday the app holds or projects, up to
  the owner's next one (rulings **R-SAL48**, **R-SAL49**);
* what a stub's figures add up to, through the one waterfall a priced
  paycheck's net uses, and the printed-net check against it (**R-SAL42**);
* the one-off name clash, ignoring capitals and extra spaces (**R-SAL45**,
  **R-SAL51** (b)), asked only of a one-off a save adds or renames
  (**R-SAL57**);
* that a stub line adds up by the kind the STUB prints it under, a re-kind of
  its paycheck line moving no saved stub (**R-SAL58**, finding SAL-567);
* that a record on a held payday and an edit onto one are both refused
  (**R-SAL52**), every tax is required, and an edit writes the stub ROW once
  -- so its version guards a child-only change -- while an identical
  re-submit writes nothing;
* the comparison report: each line beside the app's figure that payday, and
  the base-pay gap (forks 2 and 5);
* the paycheck-line delete refusal's wording (**R-SAL51** (c)).

The worked example it prices is in ``tests/test_services/_pay_stub_example.py``,
shared with ``test_pay_stub_gross.py`` (the printed-gross checks, split out of
this module at plan step salary:S11-c-2c, ledger row **SAL-594**).

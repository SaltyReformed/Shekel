"""A loan's ONE closing date, past AND future (plan step ``recurrence:R7d-h``).

``balance_at.loan_payoff_date`` answers HALF its own question: it folds FORWARD
from the confirmed present seed, so a loan already at zero has no crossing left
and returns ``None`` -- which does not mean *never*, it means *not my half*.
``loan_closing_date`` composes that forward crossing with the BACKWARD one over
the loan's recorded events, so ``None`` means only *never pays off*.

The defect these tests exist for is the RETIRED branch.  Its bound used to be
the read pass's own ``as_of``, so a finished loan's stop moved with the day the
page was rendered -- and once ``recurrence:R7d-g`` NULLs the stored column,
nothing pins it at all.  ``test_a_retired_loans_closing_date_does_NOT_move_with_the_read``
is the one that fails on the old rule; every other test here would pass under
it, so it is what this file rests on.

All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

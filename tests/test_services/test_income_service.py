"""
Shekel Budget App -- Income Service Tests (C17 / F-20 / MED-06 / F-032).

Pins the raise-aware paycheck-engine producer contract:

- The helper returns ``Decimal("0")`` when no active SalaryProfile exists.
- The helper returns ``annual_salary`` over the owner's PAYCHECK COUNT --
  derived from their cadence since plan step R-F16 -- byte-identical to the
  engine for a no-raise profile.
- The helper APPLIES applicable ``SalaryRaise`` rows so the post-raise
  per-period gross is returned -- the F-032 worked example: $104,000
  base with a 3% raise effective in the as-of period yields $4,120.00
  per period, not the pre-Commit-17 off-engine $4,000.00.
- Every downstream consumer (savings, year-end, retirement, investment)
  reads the same engine-derived value through the helper for a
  raise-applicable user.

Test fixture math (hand-computed):

- ``annual_salary = $104,000`` + 3% one-time raise effective 2026-03
- Post-raise annual = ``104000 * 1.03 = 107,120``
- Per-period (10-period-year fallback to ROUND_HALF_UP):
  ``107120 / 26 = 4,120.000...`` -> ``Decimal("4120.00")``
- Pre-fix (no raise applied): ``104000 / 26 = 4,000.00`` -> the
  pre-Commit-17 value the off-engine sites returned.

    """The New Year cliff: a projection may not change because a date passed.

    Tax configuration is seeded per year and nothing seeds the next one, so on
    every January 1 the CURRENT year is an unconfigured year.  The retired
    resolution rule substituted "the current calendar year", which cannot
    answer for the year it is itself: a request for the now-current year found
    nothing to redirect to and resolved to no configuration at all.  The
    paycheck engine reads a missing ``fica_config`` as ZERO Social Security
    (``tax_calculator.capped_social_security`` documents that arm for
    bootstrap), so the whole SS line silently vanished from every projected
    paycheck in that year and later.

    Measured on a clone of production 2026-08-11, before the fix: on
    2027-01-01, with no write and no user action, 40 of 51 live-priced salary
    rows changed and projected income over the horizon rose by **$8,460.50**;
    counting the 11 periods the grid's own rolling top-up creates that same
    day, **$10,914.93** over 51 of 62 rows.  One period went from
    ``NET 2,639.30`` (ss 205.19) to ``NET 2,844.49`` (ss 0.00).

    Neither figure was only a display defect.  A settle writes the live amount
    into ``estimated_amount`` before the status flip
    (``transaction_service._reconcile_cached_amount``), after which the row
    leaves this producer's Projected-only candidate set and nothing can repair
    it; and any salary or tax-config save regenerates every row from today
    forward.  The read-time gap had two write-back doors.

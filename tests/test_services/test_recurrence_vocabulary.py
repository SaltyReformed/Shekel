"""
Shekel Budget App -- The recurrence vocabulary (plan steps R2e-2, R7b-2)

``ref.recurrence_units`` and ``ref.period_placements`` are tables;
:class:`~app.enums.RecurrenceUnitEnum` and
:class:`~app.enums.PeriodPlacementEnum` are what the application can actually
resolve.  Every recurrence surface used to read the TABLE -- the picker offered
its rows, both write doors accepted them, and the preview previewed them --
while ``resolve`` raises for any id no enum member names and no route catches
that.  The gap between the two sets is a 500 waiting for them to diverge.

**Plan step R7b-2 moved where that gap can be reached, and plan step R7c-c
closed the older half of it.**  A form posts no pattern id: it authors
``(interval_n, unit, placement)``, so the membership question the doors ask is
asked on the two AUTHORED axes -- ``modelled_unit`` and ``modelled_placement``.
``modelled_pattern`` had one caller left, the edit form deciding whether it
could preselect anything, and R7c-c dropped both the column it read and the
function; its cases went with them.

The load-bearing tests are the two in
:class:`TestAnUnmodelledRowIsInvisible` that ask whether the offer set is
driven by a ``ref`` TABLE -- a surplus ``recurrence_units`` row, and the
``WEEK`` member that really exists and cannot be resolved.  An adversarial
review of plan step R7b-2 is why they are asked on the UNIT table: the version
asked on the PATTERN table could not fail, because ``_picker`` does not read
that table or import its model at all.

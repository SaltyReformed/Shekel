"""
Shekel Budget App -- recurring_view producer tests (Recurring cluster Loop B, P1).

Locks the unified Recurring surface's display-model producer: the summary
band, the three kind-grouped sections with per-section subtotals, and per
row the defined amount, monthly + per-paycheck equivalents, engine-backed
next date, and share of section committed total.

The producer has exactly one monthly source of truth
(``obligations_aggregator.template_monthly_or_none``); the per-paycheck
value is DERIVED from it by
``PayCadence.monthly_to_per_paycheck`` -- the OWNER's cadence since plan step
R7a-2a, a hardcoded ``12 / 26`` before it.
Every expectation below is a LITERAL hand-computed at the biweekly cadence
with its arithmetic in a comment, never a re-derivation through the producer's
own value object -- an expectation computed with ``PayCadence`` would move with
a derivation bug instead of catching it.  Real ORM templates run against the
test DB so the relationship-driven attribute access and ``ref_cache`` lookups
are exercised end to end.

    which is unanswerable for an owner who has never said how often they are

    hardcoded ``PAY_PERIODS_PER_YEAR = 26`` this step deleted: it would have
    reported a weekly-paid owner's commitments at double their per-paycheck
    cost with nothing on the page saying so.

    is the control on a broken invariant, not on a user state.  *The paragraph

    CALENDAR carrying ``cadence_days=None``, and refused when it read the
    cadence.  There is no such calendar now: ``pay_calendar.calendar_for``
    refuses that owner outright, so the surface is never handed one.

    *One case that stood here is DELETED rather than rewritten, and an
    adversarial review of that step is why.*  It asserted that ``build_view``
    refused a calendar built with ``cadence_days=None``.  The first rewrite
    made it assert that such a calendar cannot be BUILT and that
    ``calendar_for`` refuses -- two claims that touch this module not at all,
    already graded in ``test_pay_calendar_derivation.py`` and
    ``test_pay_calendar_loader.py``, sitting in a file about ``recurring_view``
    inside a class named for a property of it.  A duplicate in the wrong file
    is a test that goes stale where nobody looks for it.

    **No coverage was lost.**  The extra subject that case carried -- a
    RULE-LESS definition still reaching the section subtotal's cadence read --
    is exercised by ``test_a_rule_less_definition_still_answers_none``, which
    passes a rule-less template through ``build_view``.  What remains here is

"""The loan fold: ``app.services.balance_at._fold.fold_loan_balances``.

Plan step B1 (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  These tests pin
the fold's CONTRACT -- totality, the delta each event contributes, and the two
visibility rules it reproduces -- against HAND-COMPUTED figures.  The fold moved
into the balance seam at step D-fold (*a fold is a balance*); the WALK it samples
and the two visibility rules it reproduces stay in the ``loan_ledger`` leaf (*a
walk is a fact*), and this file also pins those leaf primitives directly.  The
leaf's CALENDAR names left at pay-calendar plan step C2-d -- see
``TestTheFoldTakesNoCalendarAndThePackageHoldsNone`` for what replaced their
tests, and ``test_pay_calendar_value.py`` for the rule that replaced them.

**Hand-computed, deliberately.**  The fold and the posted ledger share the walk
(that is the design: the postings are a PROJECTION of the fold), so grading the
fold by comparing it to the ledger would be two readers of one walk agreeing --
"two wrong implementations agreeing is not a proof" (plan Section 8).  Every
expected balance below is arithmetic done here, in the docstring, from the loan's
terms.  The exhaustive every-day parallel run against the shipping seam is step
B2's job and a different question (is the posted cache faithful?); this is the
reference's own.

        """A rate change INSIDE an accrual period never re-rates a later payment.

        The split carries the rate period its interest accrued at, and the
        confirmed schedule row displays that rate.  Before plan step
        X-au-g-2c-3b-2 the split re-resolved the period on each payment's OWN due
        date, which agreed with the accrual only while one payment fell in each
        period.

        The loan is trued to $100,000.00 on 2026-01-05 at 6%, with a rate change
        to 12% effective 2026-02-15.  Two payments satisfy installments in ONE
        accrual period, on either side of that boundary:

          Charge 2026-02-01 (the EARLIEST installment in the period), at 6%:
                             interest round(100,000.00 * 0.005) = $500.00.
          P1 (due 02-01, $1,000.00): principal $500.00, balance $99,500.00.
          P2 (due 02-20, $1,000.00): nothing stands -> principal $1,000.00.

        P2's own due date sits in the 12% period -- asserted below, so the claim
        that it reads 6% is a measurement and not a coincidence of a loan with
        one rate.

        The transition the cutover will actually exercise, and the one an
        incremental sync hides: whichever payment OPENS an accrual period carries
        its charge, and which payment that is can CHANGE when an earlier-due one
        arrives afterwards.  The first payment's correction must then reverse the
        interest and escrow it already posted, at the ``(period, entry_date)`` it
        posted them under, and its loan-linked leg must move with them.

        Settled in this order, both satisfying February:

          1. due 2026-02-20 (period 3), $1,000.00.  It is the only payment, so it
             OPENS the period: charge 02-20 -> interest $500.00, escrow $100.00,
             principal $400.00.  Those legs are POSTED.
          2. due 2026-02-01 (period 2), $1,000.00.  The charge is dated at the
             EARLIEST installment now, so it moves to 02-01 and the 02-01 payment
             clears it; the 02-20 payment becomes a follower and clears nothing.

        Final: (02-01) interest $500.00, escrow $100.00, principal $400.00;
        (02-20) interest $0.00, escrow $0.00, principal $1,000.00; owed
        $98,600.00.  **The posted balance agreeing is the assertion that matters**
        -- it can only hold if step 1's interest and escrow legs were reversed,
        since they are still on the ledger otherwise.

        The sibling test above cannot reach this: settling in pay-period order
        makes the opener arrive first, so its follower posts an EMPTY correction
        the first time and never has to reverse one.

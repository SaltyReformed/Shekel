"""Archiving a salary profile records what it was pricing (finding N-261).

Plan step **balance:X-au-d**, developer ruling 2026-09-02.

**The defect these grade did not exist before that cutover and is not
hypothetical.**  A paycheck row STORED its figure, so deactivating the profile
that computed it moved nothing.  A declared row is priced by its DEFINITION, and
once no ACTIVE profile names that definition the salary-linked refinement stops
applying -- amount rule 3 answers instead, from the single price version
``routes/salary/profiles.delete_profile`` opens the template's series at.  That
version is the ``default_amount`` scalar, which
``template_amount_service.is_salary_linked_template`` documents as *vestigial*
for exactly this kind of template, and a scalar cannot express a paycheck.

Measured on the 2026-09-02 production clone WITHOUT the freeze: 50 of 59 rows
re-priced and the projected balance moved **-$9,677.24**, because the rows range
from ``$2,483.19`` to ``$3,328.41`` and every one of them became ``$2,572.78``.
With it: **0 rows move and the balance moves `$0.00`**, re-measured the same way.

The remedy is the act a settle already performs one tier up -- record what a row
was worth at the moment the thing that computes it goes away -- and these cases
grade it on a real profile with a real paycheck engine behind it, because a
planted derivation could not tell the frozen figure from the vestigial one.

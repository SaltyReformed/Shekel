Shekel Budget App -- The outstanding set: reader, writer, and their ONE scope

Tests for :mod:`app.services.reconcile_service` -- the reconcile step's offer
set (ruling R-DH (d) / the R-M re-ruling, shipped at plan step S1-c) and the
writer that records a tick against it.

**Moved here from ``test_entry_service`` at plan step X-f2-c1** with the code
it grades, and not one assertion changed on the way: the reader's name and
return SHAPE did (``outstanding_purchases`` -> ``outstanding_set``, grouped by
envelope per ruling R-EW), so ``_listed`` flattens the groups back to the id
list every case below was written against.  Grading the same ids through a new
shape is what makes the move provably behaviour-preserving.

    CHANGED, never what was asked for, which is what makes the skip observable.

    Pay-calendar plan step **C4-a-2**, second design.  The panel dates every row
    it offers off the owner's calendar
    (:meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.require_period`), and the
    first cut reached that lookup from a scope written on
    ``pay_periods.user_id``.  Two reads of two different things then have to
    agree, and under ``READ COMMITTED`` they need not: ``/grid`` and
    ``/dashboard`` append paydays AND populate rows into them inside one
    ``write_transaction`` (``routes/_period_population.py``, ruling **R-R38**),
    so a concurrent render on a lapsed schedule creates rows this panel's query
    admits and its span lookup cannot date.  Both of this package's COMMAND
    doors render after committing -- the reconcile POST and the true-up PATCH
    through ``prompt_fragment`` -- which made it a 500 on a money screen
    (balance finding **N-358**).

    **The scope is the calendar's own saved ids now, so the state is
    inexpressible rather than merely unlikely** -- the shape
    ``statement_match._candidates`` already had, and the rule
    ``require_period``'s own docstring states: *where the precondition is
    carried by the QUERY, the total form is honest.*

    These cases hold the property directly, by handing the panel a calendar
    that legitimately lacks a period the ACCOUNT's rows are filed in.  That is
    the same shape the concurrency produces and needs no concurrency to build.

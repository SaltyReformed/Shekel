"""Ruling R-DH's invariants, at the grain the user actually reads.

``docs/audits/balance_architecture/archive/anchor_settle_partition.md``.  R-DH answers
one question -- *is this settled row already inside the balance the user
asserted?* -- and the three properties below are the ones the ruling STATES as
its acceptance criteria.  None of them existed in ``tests/`` when the fix
shipped: the adversarial review's finding N-133 / F2 measured ZERO net new tests
in the commit, and ``grep`` found these sentences only in the audit document.
A property named in a ruling and pinned nowhere is a property the next change
deletes for free.

Every assertion here is at the **projected end balance** grain -- the figure the
grid renders and the one production got wrong by ``-$4,001.42`` -- not at the
walk grain underneath it.  The walk has its own controls
(``test_cash_walk.py``, ``test_account_posting_service.py``); what those cannot
show is that the seam, the entries-aware reservation and the anchor reset
compose to a stable number, because each of the three is individually correct
about a different thing.

Figures are HAND-COMPUTED from the ruling's own worked example, which is the
developer's real bookkeeping session on 2026-07-31.

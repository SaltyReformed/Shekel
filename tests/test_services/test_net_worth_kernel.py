"""
Shekel Budget App -- Net-Worth Kernel Tests (Loop B Phase 1)

Direct coverage for the shared :mod:`app.services.balance_at._kernel`
promoted out of the year-end summary package: the per-account balance-map
dispatch over the canonical entries-aware resolver.  These tests pin the
kernel's public contract independently of its consumers.

The asset-plus / liability-minus net-worth reduction is NOT covered here.
It lives with its consumer in ``savings_dashboard_service._net_worth``
(``_sum_composition_at_period`` / ``compute_net_worth_today``) and is
covered on the live path by ``test_savings_dashboard_service.py``:
``test_assets_minus_liabilities`` and
``test_total_liabilities_is_positive_magnitude`` for the reduction, plus one
control per ``abs`` site for a negatively-stored liability --

    hero            test_a_negative_balance_liability_still_adds_its_magnitude
    per-period band test_series_liability_band_holds_a_negative_balance_magnitude

The kernel's own
``sum_net_worth_at_period`` was deleted as dead code: it had no production
caller, and its unit tests graded it against hand-built dicts rather than
against anything a screen renders.

    ``test_accounts.py`` -- the accessor's only consumer is that page's

    section until plan step F2 deleted that package.)

    X-f1c3a, not re-pointed.**  Both handed in a ``SimpleNamespace`` stand-in

    a ``NOT NULL`` column and a CHECK beside it, and which ruling R-EH deleted
    the column for.  They graded a branch no account could reach; keeping them
    would have meant keeping the branch (finding N-73).  What survives is the

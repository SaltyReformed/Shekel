"""
Shekel Budget App -- The pay calendar VALUE (plan step C2-a)

C1 proved the derivation; this proves the value built on it.  The step's whole
point is that ``app/`` holds SIX implementations of "which pay period contains
this date" (ledger row **P6**) which disagree at the edges, so these tests are
written at the edges rather than in the middle:

* the three QUESTIONS answer differently, and each difference is pinned --
  containment says ``None`` past the horizon where the span PROJECTS and the
  filing rule CLAMPS.  A test that only asked mid-schedule would pass against
  all six of the implementations this value replaces;
* the FILING rule is proven equal to the chain it deleted
  (``loan_ledger.find_period_containing_date`` composed with
  ``resolve_anchor_pay_period``) over every MATERIALISED shape, and separately
  over STORED-style period rows that a calendar cannot express at all -- a
  hole, two holes, an overlap, a shared boundary day, a runaway end.  Those
  are unconstructible through :class:`PayCalendar` because derived periods
  TILE, which is the value's own invariant, so they are built by hand.
  **That second half used to live in a session probe outside the repository**
  while four docstrings cited it as proof; plan step C2-d landed it here,
  along with the counterexample that states the equivalence's PRECONDITION
  (index order must agree with date order) rather than leaving it implied;
* the TILING invariant is asserted directly, because it is what made the
  recurrence arc's ``PeriodCalendar.__post_init__`` refusals unconstructible
  rather than merely unused -- plan step C2-b2 then deleted that class, so this
  is now the only place the property is asserted at all;
* a WINDOW keeps the ends the whole calendar derived (ledger row **P14**), and
  the control shows the value a window would report if it were re-derived --
  the ``$150,000.00`` shape;
* production's own numbers appear as the four ``loan_opening`` entries dated
  years before the first payday, which is the state the filing clamp exists for
  and the one a contiguous test schedule never reaches.

**No date here is read from a clock.**  Every date is a literal or explicit
``timedelta`` arithmetic on one, so these pass identically under
``TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`` and under the ``SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY`` sweep.  The value
has no clock; a test that gave it one would be testing the fixture.

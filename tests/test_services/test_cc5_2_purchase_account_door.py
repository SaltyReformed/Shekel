"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-2``: the purchase door takes an ACCOUNT of its own.

The FIRST door that writes a movement onto another account than its row's
(ruling **R-CC15**: a card swipe in a checking envelope is a movement ON the
card; **R-BAL75**: it folds there; **R-BAL76** dropped the key that forbade
it at ``CC-5-1``).  What is graded here is the door's own rule -- which
account a purchase may name, whose it must be, and what may not be said
beside it -- plus the two facts the design states about the written row: the
envelope's spend grows by the purchase whatever account it moved through, and
the CARD's fold sees the swipe where checking's sees nothing.

Every refusal is graded by the state it leaves: the session holds no new
purchase after a refused call, because the door composes its refusals ahead
of the write (the ``_refusals`` module's contract).

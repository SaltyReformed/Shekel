"""R4b-1: a generate pass reads the OWNER's schedule, not the caller's window.

Both recurrence engines took ONE ``periods`` list and used it for two unrelated
jobs -- the schedule each rule was RESOLVED against, and the set of periods the
pass could WRITE into.  ``period_population`` hands them only the newly created
periods, so every schedule extend re-read every rule as though the owner's pay
history began at the new batch.

Three measured consequences, all live on production (2026-08-08, against a
streamed clone of ``shekel-prod-db``), one class each below:

* **D22** -- a ``Monthly First`` rule re-fired in a month it had already
  covered: 3 spurious ``Phone Allowance`` rows, $118.62, one per extend landing
  a new period in a covered month.
* **D25** -- ``calculate_paycheck`` received the same truncated list as its
  ``all_periods``, so third-paycheck detection read 1-3 periods instead of 61.
  One salary row was STORED $502.45 below its true net pay.  The read-time
  recompute (``income_service.live_projected_net``) kept that figure off every
  surface, so what it endangered was the stored cache the grid's inline editor
  pre-fills from -- see the migration's docstring for the measurement.
* **D2** -- a rule's chosen start period was not in the window, so the opening
  bound it states was dropped.

**What was shown RED against the pre-R4b-1 code, and by what means.**  The
authority is the production path, not a ported test file: a ``git worktree`` at
``HEAD`` driving ``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` six times over a
streamed clone of ``shekel-prod-db``, against the same six on this code.

```text
                              HEAD          this code
duplicate Monthly First months   3 NEW           0
salary rows disagreeing with a
  whole-schedule recompute       1 ($502.45)     0
```

Two of the classes below were additionally ported back onto the old
``periods``-list signature and run at ``HEAD``, where they fail on their own
assertions: ``TestTheStartPeriodBoundSurvivesTheWindow`` generates two rows
into paychecks the rule's start period excludes, and
``TestThePredictionIsTheGenerationCall``'s predictor names all ten periods
where the engine fires in five.

**A textual port is lossy, and saying so is the point.**  An earlier draft of
this docstring claimed all four defects had been shown red that way.  Two of
them had not: the port's own rewrite had left a ``NameError``, and a test that
fails to import is not a test that fails.  An adversarial review caught it by
redoing the port.  The classes with no ``HEAD`` counterpart at all --
``TestTheWindowStillNarrowsWhatIsWritten``, ``TestAWindowMustBelongToTheOwner``,
``TestOneScheduleReadServesTheWholeRequest``,
``TestRegenerateSweepsOnlyWhatItRewrites`` and
``TestABoundedRuleDoesNotRestartItsCount`` -- are forward guards over shapes
this step created or an adversarial review named, not reproductions of a
measured defect, and they are labelled as such rather than counted as
evidence.

All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

        two reads of ``budget.pay_periods`` -- one ordered by the stored
        ``period_index``, one by payday -- so a stored ordinal out of payday
        order made them disagree, and disagreeing silently would have re-phased
        every ``Every N Periods`` rule for this owner.  It was refused because
        the seam could not tell which read to believe.

        There is one read now, and its order is payday order by construction

        This case therefore asserts the property the refusal was PROTECTING
        rather than the refusal: scramble the column underneath a schedule and

        class: it existed because a disagreeing ordinal would "silently
        re-phase every ``Every N Periods`` rule".  At 2 the phase is real:
        pointing the walk at the STORED column instead makes periods 0 and 1
        swap phase and this goes red.

        The swap parks one row on a spare ordinal and FLUSHES between each
        step: ``uq_pay_periods_user_index`` is checked per statement, so a

        """Defect **D22**, graded BEHAVIOURALLY because the type cannot grade it.

        The window states what a pass may WRITE; it may never state what a rule
        MEANS.  That is the $118.62 / $502.45 shape: `period_population` hands
        each engine the newly created batch, and reading the rule against that
        batch makes the batch's own first payday look like the owner's.

        **This case asserts the ANSWER, not the shape, and an adversarial
        review of plan step C2-f3c is why.**  What stood here asserted
        ``schedule.calendar is calendar`` and the calendar's own ordinals --
        one a restatement of the dataclass assignment, the other a fact the
        test itself built -- so it could not fire on the defect it was named
        for.  It cannot be graded at the type level either, though plan step
        R7d-c-1 moved WHERE the hole is: the value took its calendar then, so
        ``PayCalendar.from_paydays`` over a window's pairs was one line and one
        argument (``PeriodWindow``'s own docstring records that, as ledger row
        **P24**); it takes the READ PASS now and derives the calendar, so the
        narrowed schedule has to be seated in the pass's memo instead.  Neither
        is a state the type refuses, which is why the grade is BEHAVIOURAL: the
        one thing a narrowed calendar changes is that a ``Monthly First`` rule
        resolved against a one-period window fires in EVERY period, because
        that window's only month holds exactly one payday.

        The control is the pair: the same rule, the same one-period window, one
        schedule built the way `period_population` builds it and one built the
        way D22 built it.  If the narrowed calendar answered the same, this
        test would be measuring nothing.

    """What plan step R7d-c-1 changed, and the ordering rule it bought.

    :class:`~app.services.generation_schedule.GenerationSchedule` took a
    :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar` until that step and takes a
    :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext` now, deriving the calendar
    from it.  The reason is plan step R7d-c-2: a loan payment's closing bound
    stops being the ``budget.recurrence_rules.end_date`` column and becomes a
    fold over the loan, which needs a read pass, and the 2026-08-16 ruling
    forbids a producer below the route building one.

    Three properties are graded here, and only the first is a tidiness claim:

    * the value derives NOTHING of its own -- the pass's memo is the request's
      one derivation;
    * a pass whose calendar was resolved BEFORE the write that created the
      window's periods is REFUSED, loudly, rather than silently generating
      into a schedule that does not hold them.  That is the whole safety
      argument for letting a lazily-derived value in here at all;
    * a repopulation opens exactly ONE pass for the whole batch, whatever the
      template count, so the batch holds one calendar derivation, one
      baseline-scenario resolution and one answer per loan.  **It is NOT an
      order-independence claim**: a first draft said a transfer this loop
      generates into a loan would change a later definition's bound, and
      ``period_population``'s docstring carries the measurement that refutes
      it -- future rows do not move a derived payoff, because the ESTIMATED
      tier prices every uncovered future installment from the DEFINITION.

    for the preview and 24 for the execute over 12 envelope rows, against a
    baseline of 0.  The schedule is resolved once in
    ``_build_carry_forward_context`` and threaded.

    **The instrument changed at pay-calendar plan step C2-f3c and the claim got
    stronger.**  It counted ``pay_period_service.get_all_periods``, which the

    twelve.  The old assertion could not see that at all; a service deriving

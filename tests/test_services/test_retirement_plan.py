"""
Shekel Budget App -- Retirement Plan Producer Tests (C2-f2d-2)

The step made "the retirement picture at a candidate plan" ONE producer where
there were two, and the two claims that carries are graded here:

* **One derivation per plan.**  Asking for the same
  :class:`~app.services.retirement_plan.PlanPoint` twice returns the SAME
  object, so the readiness hero and the lever card's baseline cannot state
  different figures for one plan.  Asserted as IDENTITY, because equality is
  what the old two-derivation shape already satisfied right up until the day
  it did not.
* **One blended return.**  The rate the assumptions rail displays, the rate the
  readiness chart reverses under, and the rate the contribution lever divides
  the shortfall by are one value.  Its arithmetic is pinned HERE rather than in
  ``tests/manual/verify_retirement_render.py``, because on the developer's own
  data every projecting account carries the SAME assumed return -- so the
  weighting, the zero arms and the two-decimal round-trip are all invisible to
  that harness (measured 2026-08-16: removing the quantization moved zero
  lines).

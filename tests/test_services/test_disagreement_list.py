"""Where an account's bank record and its books part -- plan step balance:X-bk-1.

``outstanding_difference.disagreement_list``: the books span the outstanding
difference grades as ONE verdict, cut into back-to-back stretches of one kind
each (agrees, disagrees, no statement yet, not compared), every one graded by
the same grader, with each disagreeing day's bank lines and app rows -- and the
imported days either side of the span set apart.  Ruling **R-BAL232**, the
developer's "Tested report + script": the list the one-time reconcile (plan
step X-bk-2) is written from and re-measured against.

**The first class is the ruling's worked example, built as a real CSV
statement would hold it**: a statement from Jan 1 to Mar 31, books from Feb 2
to Mar 31 (58 days), a ``$400.00`` card payment the bank shows on Feb 10 and
the app does not, three card paybacks totalling ``$395.00`` the app shows on
Feb 11 and the bank does not, and a ``$120.00`` electric bill the app dates
Mar 5 and the bank Mar 7.  The ruling's own words fix what it must answer:
Feb 10-11 one two-day disagreeing stretch, Mar 5 and Mar 7 two one-day
stretches, and the stretches adding up to all 58 days.  **Two lines the
ruling does not name are added, and why is the builder's first paragraph**:
the only adapter declares a statement's window as its own first..last line
day, so a CSV statement declaring Jan 1 - Mar 31 has a line on each end.  The same
example after the reconcile's acts is graded too: it reconciles.  Every
figure here is MADE UP (ruling **R-BAL132**).

**Every case asserts the PARTITION** (:func:`_assert_partition`): the
stretches begin on the span's first day, run back to back with no two
neighbours of one kind, end on its last day, and their verdicts add up to the
whole span's count by count -- and every stretch names exactly as many days
as its verdict counts as disagreeing.  That is what makes the list a
decomposition of the verdict the reconcile is done against rather than a
second opinion beside it.

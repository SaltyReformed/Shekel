"""What ONE calendar day is worth, and the three ways its amount is read.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``.  ``calendar_day_flows`` holds a day's
display ORDER, its (income, expense) FOLD and its "+N more" RESIDUAL, and all
three read the same :attr:`DayEntry.amount`.  Two read it as a FIGURE and one
as a RANKING, and getting that difference wrong is a money defect rather than a
style one.

**Every case here is a pure function over constructed records**, which is the
point of the module existing: these three rules were private inside a
database-heavy service and could only be reached through
``get_month_detail``, so the boundary that matters -- a NEGATIVE amount on an
expense row -- had no cheap case.  ``TestARefundedDayOnTheRealCalendar`` in
``test_calendar_service`` drives the same rules through the producer chain, so
the chain and the arithmetic are graded separately.

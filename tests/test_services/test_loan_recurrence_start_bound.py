"""C9a: a recurring loan payment cannot start before the loan does.

``RecurrenceRule.starts_on`` is the opening half of a recurrence's validity
window, derived by ``loan_recurrence_sync.sync_recurring_payment_bounds`` from
the loan's FIRST CONTRACTUAL INSTALLMENT.  It was ``start_date`` until plan
step R7c-b, which made the column the rule's FIRST OCCURRENCE rather than a
bound the occurrences were filtered against (ruling R-R16); for a loan payment
billing on a day of the month the two are the same date, because the first
installment IS the first occurrence.

**What it prevents, measured.** Before this bound, ``create_payment_transfer``
built its rule with no start at all and generated across every materialized pay
period, so a mortgage closing 2026-04-15 got payments due 2026-02-01,
2026-03-01 and 2026-04-01 -- three installments for a loan that did not exist.
Each debited the cash projection immediately ($3,220.92 total on the fixture's
10-period window; production materializes ~52), and each became an FU-5 money
erasure the moment it settled: the fold splits a pre-origination payment against
a ZERO balance, so it books $0.00 principal and routes the whole payment to a
Refund Receivable, then the origination anchor resets the balance over it.

All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

    and early-returns when ``starts_on`` is absent -- which is exactly what a
    loan destination's submission looks like, because the form locks that
    control and a disabled input posts nothing.  The route then DERIVES the
    date from the loan's contract, after validation has finished, so any past
    "Ends on" passed every validator and reached the write door beside a start
    it had never been compared to.

    The "Ends" control is NOT locked on the create form -- the server does not
    know the destination at render -- so the form invites this.

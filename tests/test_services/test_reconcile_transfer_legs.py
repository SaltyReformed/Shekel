"""
Shekel Budget App -- The reconcile panel and carry-forward walk TRANSFERS (leaf X-bi-6-4c-2)

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-2`` moved three readers off a transfer's SHADOW
rows: the reconcile panel offers the transfer's LEG on the statement's account
(``transfer_legs.offerable_transfer_legs``), carry-forward walks the source
period's transfers, and the recurrence engine's records predicate asks
``transfer_legs.transfers_holding_records``.  These tests pin what that leaf
changed and what it declared:

* a leg is keyed by ``(transfer id, account id)`` (ruling **R-BAL87**) and
  ticked under its own form fields (ruling **R-BAL145**), so a transfer whose
  id equals a bill's id is offered and settled beside it rather than
  overwriting it;
* the loader's scope, and that the PARENT's status decides it;
* the transfer block's heading is the leg's label from the endpoints' current
  names (declared), each side is offered on its own account's statement as
  a TRANSFER, and the detail page, the panel's fragment and the true-up's
  modal (beside a bill) offer the transfer's tick (ruling **R-BAL235**
  retired **R-BAL148**'s warning);
* a carry-forward transfer plan is labelled by its FROM side, in transfer-id
  order (finding **BAL-546**, declared).

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` deleted three cases that planted a
transfer's shadow (ruling **R-BAL313**) -- the records predicate's own case
(a movement under a hidden shadow), a broken pair offered and settled, and a
loader case under a Cancelled shadow -- and re-expressed two panel cases
that hid one: no shadow can be stored since that step's first checkpoint
(ruling **R-BAL258**), and what each deleted case still read on a plain
transfer is read by another passing case.

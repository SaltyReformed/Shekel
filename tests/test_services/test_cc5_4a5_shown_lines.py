"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``: the removal act asks what the owner was SHOWN.

Ruling **R-CC81** (developer 2026-09-23): *"The shared removal function
requires every button that calls it to pass what you were shown before the
press, or to name the ruling that lets it stay silent (Mark Paid)."*  Ruling
**R-CC127** (developer 2026-09-30), the picked text: *"Each warning also sends
back the bank lines it named, and the function compares them with what it
would undo.  At 10:10 they differ, so nothing is saved ... A button with no
warning sends nothing, so it can undo a match only by naming its ruling in
code."*

Every case runs a production verb over a MATCHED payment: the Hotel bill's
``$120.00`` payment matched to the bank's ``HOTEL -$120.00`` line, which a
``$0.00`` Actual takes off the books (the status seam's ``_withdraw``).  The
refused cases roll back as the doors' refusal paths do
(``routes/transactions/_helpers._error_transaction_response``) and assert the
act and the payment both still stand.

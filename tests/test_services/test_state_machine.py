"""
Shekel Budget App -- State Machine Unit Tests

Direct tests of the two ``app.services.state_machine`` helpers:
``verify_transition`` -- governs every legal transition for both
Transaction.status_id and Transfer.status_id -- and
``finalised_edit_rejection`` -- the companion that locks money / period
/ category / due-date field edits on a finalised (is_immutable) row
(#26).

Audit reference: F-046 / F-047 / F-161 / commit C-21 of the
2026-04-15 security remediation plan.

Coverage matrix
---------------

For every (current, new) pair where the helper either accepts or
rejects, we have one positive and one negative test.  Identity
transitions (current == new) are covered for every status because the
HTMX UI's idempotent re-submission relies on them silently
succeeding.

The helper does not consult the database -- it reads ref_cache, which
is initialised by the ``app`` fixture's create_app() flow.  All tests
therefore use ``app.app_context()`` so ``ref_cache.status_id(...)``
resolves to the live integer PKs.

    An envelope settles at ``sum(entries)`` over EVERY entry it holds, and a
    card purchase is one of those -- but a card purchase never touches
    checking, which is exactly why the purchase arm refuses to OFFER one.  So a
    `$40` debit plus a `$60` card purchase is offered at `$100.00` on a screen
    captioned "tick everything your statement shows", against a statement
    showing `$40`.

    **The LEDGER was right either way** -- a card purchase moves nothing
    through checking (``cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg``), as the row's own leg
    of the time subtracted the credit sum -- so the fix prints both figures
    rather than changing what a tick books: ``actual_amount`` legitimately IS
    total spend, and moving it would make the panel disagree with the grid
    and the analytics.

    Production carries 18 card entries in history and ZERO on a Projected

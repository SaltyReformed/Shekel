"""The forward occurrence engine (plan steps R3 and R4a).

``app.services.recurrence.occurrences`` walks a rule's cadence forward and
``place`` carries each occurrence onto a pay period.  Plan step R3 built both
parallel and unread; plan step R4a made
``recurrence_engine.match_periods`` a thin adapter over them (plan step R4b-2
replaced it with ``recurrence.rule_occurrences``), so every pay
period the application generates a row into is now selected here.

**What :class:`TestTheParallelRun` asserts changed at R4a, and the change is
the step.**  It used to drive the NEW engine through
``tests/oracles/recurrence_baseline.py``'s shapes and compare against a
snapshot frozen from the OLD one, with 12 shapes declared to diverge.  The
cutover made the forward engine the engine, the snapshot was re-frozen from it
(+122 / -4 lines over exactly those 12 shapes), and the old-versus-new
comparison now lives in that commit's diff.  What the class asserts now:

* **the snapshot is what the engine answers, for all 430 shapes.**  Not a
  tautology -- the snapshot goes through the adapter (ORM-row mapping, the
  ``effective_from`` floor, occurrence ordering including repeats) and this
  side drives ``resolve`` / ``occurrence_placements`` directly, so equal lists
  prove the adapter reports the engine rather than reshaping it;
* **no ``bounds.*`` shape fires outside its own window** (ruling R-R6, plan
  defect D5), asserted over all 8 rather than the 4 that moved, plus the four
  rows R-R6 named checked from three directions so a stale declaration fails;
* **the ``long_cadence.*`` answers match an INDEPENDENT day-by-day sweep**
  (:func:`_day_sweep_occurrences`) placed by linear scan, because "the new
  number is bigger" is not a proof that it is right.  This is the one oracle
  in the file that is not the engine, the snapshot, or a re-frozen version of
  either, and it is what the R4a re-freeze rests on;
* **every emitted occurrence either places or is named in advance**
  (:data:`_EXPECTED_UNPLACED`).  The snapshot records PERIODS, so an
  occurrence with nowhere to live has no line in it: a neutral review built a
  mutant emitting one unplaceable occurrence per rule and left every other
  test green.

**Five of the eight long-cadence shapes did not exist before plan step R3.**
The R1 builder covered ``MONTHLY`` and ``QUARTERLY`` only, so
``MONTHLY_FIRST``, ``SEMI_ANNUAL`` and ``ANNUAL`` were unmeasured at any
cadence but the developer's -- and ``MONTHLY_FIRST`` turned out to be the one
that mattered
(:meth:`TestTheParallelRun.test_monthly_first_defers_several_months_onto_one_paycheck`).
``ANNUAL`` and ``long_cadence.every_period`` are the controls; both agreed at
90 days and neither moved.

The rest of the file exercises the engine directly, at exact dates against
hand-built schedules -- no database, no clock -- including the three things
``resolve`` cannot yet produce and only a hand-built
:class:`~app.services.recurrence.ResolvedRecurrence` can reach: the ``WEEK``
unit and a business-day shift.  A COUNT bound was a third until plan step
R7b-3 gave it a form control.

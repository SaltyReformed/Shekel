"""The SKIP act: what recording one does, what undoing one does, and what neither does.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4a``, rulings **bank_import:R-HP** and **R-JG**.
SKIP is the fourth verb a bank line can end on and the only one that names no
row of the owner's, so it needed a store of its own; these are its two doors.

**Three subjects, and the third is the one that matters most.**  What the doors
WRITE is one; what the review pass then STOPS asking about is the second; and
the third is that a skip moves NO money -- which is a claim about four tables
this leaf does not touch and about a hero figure it must not move.  A leaf that
only proved the first two would have proved that the rows appear, not that they
are harmless.

**The verb is still SHUT on the screen**, and that is deliberate:
``X-gj-4b`` lights the control.  Nothing here renders anything, so nothing here
asserts about a card.

**The READER is the fourth subject** (plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c-2``):
what the Skipped tab lists, in what order, and for whom.  It is graded here
rather than beside the page because it is a query -- who the rows belong to and
how they are sorted -- where :mod:`.test_reconcile` grades what the page makes
of them.

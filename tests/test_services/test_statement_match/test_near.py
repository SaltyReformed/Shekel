"""The SECOND tier: a figure that nearly agrees, scored rather than gated.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6d-1**, ruling **R-GD(b)**, finding **N-335**.
:mod:`app.services.statement_match._near` is pure -- lines and candidates in,
proposals out -- so every case here is built from values, exactly as
``test_propose`` is and for the same reason: what a matcher CHOOSES between two
plausible rows is the thing worth asserting, and building a database state per
case would hide it.

**Each refusal below is a FIRING CONTROL.**  This tier's whole risk is that it
offers a pairing the app cannot justify, and every one of its five admission
rules was measured to be load-bearing on the developer's own production clone
2026-08-22:

* the RELATIVE bound -- three cents is 0.017% of the `$178.29` Geico line and
  15% of an `$18.64` swipe, so an absolute one means two different things;
* the MERCHANT -- without it a `Lowe's` swipe pairs with a
  ``CC Payback: Mint Mobile`` row 0.106% away and an `Amazon` swipe with a
  ``Kayla`` envelope 0.339% away, while the genuine `Geico` pairs sit 0.180%
  out, so no distance separates them;
* the row's own FIGURE -- 2 of those 4 wrong candidates are CC paybacks the
  accept door refuses by name, so offering one renders an Accept that cannot
  succeed;
* the DAY WINDOW, shared with the exact tier rather than re-derived;
* being the ONLY candidate on both sides, because two rows that both name the
  merchant have exhausted the evidence and separating them by two basis points
  is arithmetic dressed as a finding.

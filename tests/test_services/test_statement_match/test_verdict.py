"""What a standing rule comes to for one pass, and why one did not fire.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-3a``, finding **N-359**.  The verdict is the ONE
value ruling **R-GH**'s automatic door and the review screen both read, so the
cases here grade two things and not one: that each withholding reason fires and
that the door acts on the value rather than re-deriving it.

**The reason the last of those is a MUTATION and not a comparison.** Two
derivations of one rule agree until they drift, so asserting that the door's
sentence equals the screen's would pass on the day before the drift as happily
as on every day after it.  What cannot pass is a door handed a verdict nothing
else could have produced: if it still files the line, it never read one.

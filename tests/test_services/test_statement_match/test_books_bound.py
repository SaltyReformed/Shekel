"""A bank line the account's books cannot hold is neither offered nor matched.

Plan step **balance:X-f3c-2b-2b**, finding **N-383**, ruling **balance:R-HG**.

An opening equity is the balance at the CLOSE of the day the books open, so
every dollar the bank moved on or before that day is inside the one figure.
Recording such a line -- as a purchase, as income, or as the evidence for
settling a row the owner already had -- counts that money twice.

**The two halves this module grades, and the second is a MONEY defect the
first would not have caught.**

* The review pass no longer OFFERS such a line: it reaches no card, no
  proposal and no create control, and what the screen says instead is a bound
  naming the opening and the restatement act.
* The three doors REFUSE it, which the offer split does not make redundant: a
  page rendered before a restatement moved the books forward posts line ids
  the current books no longer hold.  The match door is the sharp case --
  ``record_match`` settles every member on the LATEST of its bank days, so a
  GROUP holding one pre-opening line and one later line settles after the
  books open and clears ``reject_movement_before_books_open`` untouched.

**Measured on a restored production clone 2026-08-31, at this branch's
migration head, with the developer's own 378 SECU lines loaded**: Checking's
books open 2026-03-26 holding `$689.16`, which is the pay calendar's own first
day, so four lines post inside the opening.  Before this step two of them were
offered live controls with no withholding at all -- a `$2,573.42` payroll
deposit and a `-$108.87` Amazon swipe -- and the other two were PROPOSED
matches inside the one-click sweep.  Accepting a group of the 2026-03-26
`-$15.96` line with the 2026-08-17 `-$64.04` line against one `$80.00`
envelope was ACCEPTED and settled it on 2026-08-17.

**Why the fixture restates the books FORWARD.**  A factory account's books
open the day before the bootstrap pay period, so every line inside them is
also before the pay calendar and the calendar bound catches it first -- the
two bounds are disjoint and the calendar is applied first.  The shape that
exercises this one is the developer's own: books opening ON the calendar's
first day.  :func:`_books_open_on` goes through the table's ONE writer rather
than a raw ``INSERT``, which is the right habit -- but it is NOT evidence that
a door could produce the state, and a first version of this paragraph said it
was.  ``stage_account_opening`` explicitly does not bound the day; the DOOR
does.  What makes these fixtures production shapes is that the day chosen is
one ``apply_opening_restatement`` would accept, which is asserted where it
matters -- ``test_opening_restatement.py``'s own door cases.

        Added by ``pay_calendar:C4-a-4`` after this class merged with it
        (adversarial coordination, 2026-08-31).  Both CREATE cases beside it
        pass a :class:`NewEnvelope`, so both exercise the MINT path and
        neither ever selects an existing destination -- and destination
        SELECTION is exactly what that step rewrote (``destinations_for``
        scopes by the calendar's saved period ids where it scoped by
        ``pay_periods.user_id``).  So this door's placement promise was pinned
        on one of its two arms.

        **The state could not be built before that merge**, which is why the
        gap is a property of the harness rather than an oversight: the seeded
        account's books open on or before its calendar
        (``open_books_before_the_first_assertion`` takes a minimum that
        includes the owner's earliest pay period), so "a day a pay period
        covers AND before the books open" is EMPTY there and the calendar
        bound fires first.  It needs an account whose books open INSIDE the
        calendar, which is :func:`_an_account_opening_inside_the_calendar`.

        **What this case controls, MEASURED rather than asserted, because the
        obvious claim is false.**  Moving the refusal below
        ``resolve_destination`` -- the mutation
        ``test_the_CREATE_door_refuses_and_MINTS_NO_ENVELOPE`` kills -- leaves
        this case GREEN, because on the existing-destination path that call
        MINTS nothing and there is no staged row between the two positions.
        What this one kills is the refusal moved below ``_born_purchase`` /
        ``close_container``, which is the first thing this path actually
        stages.

        So the two cases BRACKET the window rather than duplicate it: the
        sibling catches a refusal that has slipped past the MINT, this one
        catches a refusal that has slipped past the WRITE, and neither catches
        the other's mutation.  Both were run.

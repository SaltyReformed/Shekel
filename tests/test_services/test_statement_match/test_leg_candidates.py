"""Statement match offers a transfer's side as its LEG -- leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-1``.

A still-planned transfer is offered on each of its accounts as the TRANSFER
(``RowKind.LEG``), keyed by the transfer's id on the screen's account
(rulings **R-BAL87**, **R-BAL159**), and a paid one's side as its LEG's
record, a SETTLEMENT whose parent is the transfer rather than a row.  Until
this leaf both were reached through the transfer's SHADOW row on the account
-- a TRANSACTION keyed by the shadow's id, and a SETTLEMENT whose parent was
the shadow -- which plan step ``X-bi-6-4d``, deleting the shadows, would have
left offering nothing.

Each class pins one fact of the new shape: what is offered and how it is
priced, labelled and dated; how an accepted leg is recorded and claimed;
how the PARENT decides a side (ruling **R-JM**, R-BAL79) in two drifted
states the status-band rule refuses at commit and in the ``$0.00`` close;
and the re-price a stale form meets.  The before/after
grade over the 2026-09-30 00:11 production dump lives with the leaf's
handoff, not here.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` deleted three of the four cases that read
or hid a transfer's shadow (ruling **R-BAL313**) -- no shadow ever a
candidate, and a damaged pair (rulings **R-BAL158**, **R-BAL235**) offered at
its price and once after a revert; the fourth, a renamed account's label,
lost its shadow contrast.  No shadow can be stored since that step's first
checkpoint (ruling **R-BAL258**), and what each deleted case still read on a
plain transfer is read by another passing case (the bill beside one, by
``test_candidates``).

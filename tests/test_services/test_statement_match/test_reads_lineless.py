"""A match that lost its bank lines does not take the review screen down.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6a-4**.  The state needs a code defect to reach --
``record_match`` refuses an empty side at the one writer,
``fk_statement_match_members_line_account`` refuses to remove a line a match
names, and migration ``e4a7c0f13b92`` deleted the acts that already held none
-- and what happens if it is reached anyway was measured by two adversarial
reviews 2026-08-20 rather than argued.

**Skipping it silently was the original defect** (invisible, and its rows stay
claimed).  **Raising takes the whole review surface down for that account**,
including the release control that would repair it, which is the rule
``_accepted_view._accepted_row`` already states in as many words for its own
degraded case.  So the reader degrades and the operator is told at ERROR.

**WHERE each half lives moved at plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-1c``**, finding
**N-389**, and the two halves are still both here.  The skip was a Python
guard inside the fold, which is the same invariant spelled a second time in a
language the COUNTS read could not share -- so a caption derived from the
table and cards derived from the fold disagreed by one for every such act.
:data:`~app.services.statement_match._release.NAMES_A_BANK_LINE` states it once
in SQL: the loader narrows on it, so the fold cannot receive one and its guard
is deleted; and :func:`~app.services.statement_match._accepted_view
.accepted_counts` narrows and ALARMS on it, which is the read the Reconcile
page performs on every render whichever tab is open.  The equality that motion
bought is graded in ``test_reconcile.TestACaptionCountsOnlyWhatItsTabCanDraw``.

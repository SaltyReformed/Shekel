"""The ACCEPT door: what it refuses, and what it moves when it does not.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6a-2**, rulings **R-FS**, **R-FP** and **R-FV**.
This is the only door in the arc that moves money, so every one of its
refusals is a FIRING CONTROL here -- written to fail if the refusal were
deleted, which is the standard ``docs/plans/verification.md`` sets and which
this project has twice measured the absence of.

**What the door promises, and what each class below pins:**

* a group's two sides SUM, or nothing is written and the difference is named;
* every member row takes the bank's day -- settling a Projected row and
  correcting a settled one;
* it does NOT write ``reconciled_by_id`` (ruling **R-FV**) and it RELEASES any
  link it moves a day out from under;
* an id outside the owner's own candidate set is refused, not skipped;
* a release restores the QUESTION and leaves the days alone.

    ``_builders.a_transaction`` writes ``status_id`` and ``settled_on``

    own writer, and that route is DELIBERATE -- a broken settle verb must not
    also break the
    fixture that would have caught it (the builders' own module docstring).
    **What nobody stated was the consequence.**  Those rows carry no ledger
    postings, so ``_apply_day`` reaches ``apply_requested_status``, which
    reconciles and re-posts at the new day -- and a defect that left the OLD
    day's posting behind, the classic double-count on a re-dated settle, was
    invisible to every case in this file.  X-f6a-3c-2's batch-versus-per-act
    control compares postings between the two paths and so could not see an
    error common to both.

    **The remedy is a fixture built through the REAL settle door**

    route does), and an assertion about the OLD day rather than only the new
    one.  It sits beside the ORM-built cases rather than replacing them,
    because the two grade different things.

    **ONLY THE LEDGER CASE BELOW CATCHES A LEFTOVER POSTING, and that is worth
    stating because it is the opposite of what one would assume.**  Planting
    the defect ruling **R-FA** exists to prevent -- a matcher that stamps
    ``settled_on`` itself instead of going through the status door, so the old
    day's posting stands and no new one is written -- fails
    ``test_the_rows_cash_NETS_to_the_banks_day_alone`` and leaves
    ``test_the_OLD_days_balance_stops_carrying_the_row`` GREEN.  The balance

"""Applying a whole reviewed pass in one request -- plan step X-f6a-3c-2.

Finding **N-306**.  The review screen offers two acts and, until this step,
each was its own request through its own money door: 215 round trips on the
developer's own statement, each paying 3.593 s of ``candidates_for`` before it
wrote a row.  This module is about what changed and what must not have.

**The three properties that carry the money risk:**

1. **Isolation.**  A refused item leaves NOTHING behind and the rest still
   land.  Measured on the developer's own data, 5 of 124 proposals refuse
   today and will keep refusing (a settled credit-card payback whose derived
   figure has drifted), so a pass that failed whole would lose 119 good
   corrections to one divergence.
2. **Freshness.**  One derivation serves the whole pass, so an item must not be
   handed a row or an envelope an EARLIER item in the same pass has claimed.
   That is what :func:`~app.services.statement_match.matched_subjects` being
   re-read per act buys, and it is the arm a snapshot would silently break.
3. **Failing loud.**  A ``PostingError`` is a broken ledger invariant rather
   than one item's refusal, so it takes the whole request down.

**What the collision cases here fix in place is a REAL number**: 4 envelopes on
the developer's own statement are both named by a proposal and offered as a
destination, so 15 of the 91 creatable lines aim at one.

    ``_reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase`` refuses exactly that.  **Measured

    ``entry_service.update_entry`` -- which every matched PURCHASE goes through

    candidate priced off that column; and it is the purchase's SIBLING under
    one envelope, not its parent, so no guard here can see the relation.

    printed where the owner can override it.

    **It moves NO money**, which the batch-vs-one-at-a-time control above now

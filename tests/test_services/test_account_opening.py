"""What an account's books opened with, as a recorded fact (plan step X-f3c-2a).

Grades ``budget.account_openings`` and the one loader that reads it
(:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.account_opening_fact`), plus the property the
whole step exists for: a BACK-DATED assertion no longer redefines the level
every historical balance rests on.

The fold's own arithmetic over that level is graded in ``test_cash_fold.py``
(:class:`~tests.test_services.test_cash_fold.TestTheOpeningEquityIsTheSeed`) and
the posted ledger's use of it in ``test_account_posting_service.py``; this file
is about the RECORD.

**Every account here is built with**
:func:`tests._test_helpers.create_account_via_service` **rather than the shared**
``create_account_of_type``, and that is the point rather than a detail (plan
step X-f3c-2b).  The shared factory returns an account that has ALREADY
EXISTED: it appends a second ``budget.account_openings`` row so a fixture can
date movements before the account's own creation day.  That is the right
default everywhere else and it is exactly wrong here, where the subject IS the
one row ``account_service.create_account`` writes -- a suite asserting "there
is one opening row, dated where the assertion is" would otherwise be grading
the fixture.

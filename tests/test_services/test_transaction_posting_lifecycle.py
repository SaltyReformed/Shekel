"""Lifecycle tests for the transaction -> posting-ledger wiring (Step 3, Commit 6).

Commit 6 wires :func:`~app.services.posting_service.sync_transaction_postings`
into every ordinary-transaction effect boundary -- the mark-done / PATCH /
cancel / delete routes, the envelope entry-mutation service, the credit
payback-delete paths, and carry-forward -- so settling, editing, reverting,
deleting, and carrying forward a transaction keep the append-only double-entry
ledger in step.  These tests drive transactions END TO END through those
handlers (NOT by calling ``posting_service`` directly -- that is Commit 4's unit
suite) and assert the resulting ledger state.

The load-bearing wiring properties, each pinned by a test below:

  * the reconcile runs LAST, after every effect field is applied -- so a manual
    ``actual_amount`` posts the ACTUAL not the estimate, and a
    settle-and-recategorize PATCH posts the NEW category (the 2.8b HIGH, both
    directions);
  * a revert-and-recategorize PATCH reverses the OLD category read from the
    ledger, not the new ``category_id`` (the 2.8 CRITICAL), at the route level;
  * the PATCH reconcile is gated, so a metadata-only edit posts nothing;
  * an envelope posts its debit-only effect (``effective - Sigma(credit)``), and
    an entry mutation on a SETTLED envelope re-syncs while ``toggle_cleared``
    does not;
  * every delete path (hard / soft, the settled-payback unmark, and a recursive
    payback chain) reverses before the row leaves the table;
  * carry-forward posts the confirmed effect of each envelope source it settles.

After each mutation the per-account reconciliation invariant is asserted in
its Build-Order Step 5 ABSOLUTE form: ``account_posting_total == opening
anchor + settled_transfer_effect + settled_transaction_effect``.  The seed
Checking carries its $1000.00 opening correction from fixture time, and every
settle in this suite is stamped at SERVER now (the seam's ``db.func.now()``,
including carry-forward's ``settle_from_entries`` default) -- after the
origination assertion -- so the settled effects ride on top of the opening
and the Checking totals below are ``1000.00 + effect``.  All money is
``Decimal`` from strings, with the arithmetic shown per the testing standard.

        posting day appeared nowhere in it.  That effect now nets the row's
        already-posted purchases, so recording the day moves the ``$40.00`` OUT
        of the envelope's close and INTO a leg of its own on the day the bank
        took it.

        Hand-computed.  The purchase's ``purchased_on`` is the period's start
        (``_add_purchase``), which is the very day the fixture's opening
        assertion declares ``$1,000.00`` for -- so recording that as the posting
        day says *the bank had taken this $40.00 when I read that balance*:

        * BEFORE: the envelope's whole ``$40.00`` was booked at its own settle
          day, after the assertion, so the ledger read ``$960.00`` -- the
          ``$40.00`` counted once inside the declared balance and once again on
          the way out.  That double count is **N-274**;
        * AFTER: the purchase's leg lands on the assertion's own day, the
          opening correction absorbs it, and the ledger reads the ``$1,000.00``
          the owner actually declared.

        The envelope's own leg reverses to zero (a second transaction-linked
        entry) and one purchase-linked entry appears.  Both halves are asserted:
        a test checking only the total would pass against a build that recorded
        the day and posted nothing.

        **The ORDER of the two acts changed at plan step X-au-c3** and the end
        state did not.  The parent used to be SETTLED when the day was
        recorded -- ``update_entry`` was described here as *the door a user has
        for a purchase on an already-settled envelope*.  That door is closed: a
        settled row's purchases are closed too, because carry-forward has
        already moved its leftover into a later period and re-pricing it from a
        partial record hands spent money back to the projection.  So the day is
        recorded while the row is still PROJECTED -- which is the order the
        reconcile panel produces anyway, its purchase arm admitting only
        projected parents (``reconcile_service._purchases._outstanding_scope``)

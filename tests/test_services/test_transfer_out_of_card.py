"""
Shekel Budget App -- a transfer OUT of a credit card is refused at both doors

Plan step ``credit_card:CC-10``, design ``docs/design/credit_card_from_scratch.md``
3.8: no cash advances, no balance transfers.
``_validation._reject_transfer_out_of_revolving`` is the loan refusal's
sibling inside ``_validation._reject_unmodeled_source``, the ONE set of source
refusals both doors call -- ``create_transfer`` and the endpoint move in
``_endpoints._resolve_endpoints`` -- and nowhere else.  The allow pins are the
controls: the SAME requests with the card as the DESTINATION succeed, so the
refusal is attributable to the card being the SOURCE and to nothing else.

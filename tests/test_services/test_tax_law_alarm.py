"""
Shekel Budget App -- Tests for the tax-law alarm (plan step salary:X-at-4).

The ONE check every tax-law alarm reads (ruling salary:R-SAL74): the banner on
every owner page and the weekly GitHub run from November 1, CI's refusal from
December 1.  What "complete" means is ruling salary:R-SAL86: the due year is
in the law and lists every state an earlier year lists, a year may ship in
parts, and every alarm names what is still missing.

Every law here is MADE UP and every day is passed in, so nothing in this
module moves when a real year is published or the calendar turns (ruling
salary:R-SAL80's reason, and the weekly calendar sweep's).

"""Tests for ``pay_period_admin`` slice (b): the lock classifier, plus the
reusable ``assert_pay_period_invariants`` checker's own self-tests.

The classifier (`classify_schedule_locks`) is the
single place that decides whether a pay period may be deleted or rebuilt.
Getting it wrong risks either silently wiping real money (a settled
period misread as mutable) or refusing legitimate edits, so every reason
and the precedence between them is asserted here.

**It classifies DERIVED periods since plan step C2-f3b**, so every case here
resolves its ORM row through the owner's calendar first (:func:`_derived`) --
the same derivation the four destructive doors classify against.  Two
properties that retype creates are graded in their own classes below: the
HISTORICAL test reads the DERIVED end rather than the stored ``end_date``
column, and an unmaterialised period is refused rather than keyed under
``None``.

The invariant checker is the load-bearing safety net every later
mutation test calls.  A checker that always passes is worse than none,
so its self-tests prove it passes on a healthy schedule and on a real owner's
whole data set.  See ``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_period_crud.md``.

*Its three RAISES cases went at plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-c`` with the four
invariants they graded -- an ordinal out of date order, an ordinal gap and a
span overlap -- because all three states were written by hand into two columns
that step dropped.*

    period list.  **The one reader that survived C2-f3b,
    ``_future_period_count`` on the rolling top-up, went at C4's first
    commit**, so the census below asserts the EMPTY set for both files
    (finding **P70**).

    **Plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-c`` dropped the two COLUMNS, and that does
    NOT retire this class -- an adversarial review of that step caught it being
    deleted as though it did** (2026-09-01).  The predicate matches an
    attribute NAME on any receiver, and

    what this grades is unchanged and is now the only thing holding it: that

    ``current_and_future``, ``period_by_id``, ``covers`` -- rather than by

    to do with the columns at all.

    **Two adversarial reviews of this step measured the FIRST cut of this class
    passing on the defect it names**, and the rewrite is theirs.  That predicate
    matched only ``PayPeriod.<column>`` -- an ``ast.Name`` receiver -- and
    walked only inside function definitions, so an INSTANCE read
    (``row.end_date``, which is how every ORM consumer in this codebase actually
    reads a column), a module-level constant, and an aliased import were all
    invisible; two mutations were measured surviving a green suite.  This one
    records ``(scope, attribute, receiver)`` for EVERY spelling over the WHOLE
    module and asserts the exact set, so any new read fails the census whatever
    it is written on.  See ``docs/plans/lessons.md`` on a guard graded by a

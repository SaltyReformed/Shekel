"""
Shekel Budget App -- obligations_aggregator service tests (E-24, HIGH-05).

Locks the single canonical monthly-equivalent aggregator behind both
the Recurring surface and the ``/savings`` emergency-fund baseline +
per-goal contribution floors. Before this aggregator, four near-
identical loops applied the filter (skip ONCE / skip expired / skip
no-rule / skip missing-or-zero amount); only the three
``/obligations`` loops applied the expired-rule guard, so an expired
recurring expense inflated the EF baseline forever (HIGH-05 / D6-05).

Every test below sets up real ORM templates against the test DB so
the relationship-driven attribute access in
``template_monthly_or_none`` is exercised end-to-end, and computes
its expected value by hand from the named factors -- no test
inlines a literal 26/12 for the expectation, so a regression of
the factor would surface here.

**One of those factors stopped being a constant at plan step R7a-2a.**
``PAY_PERIODS_PER_YEAR`` was a module-level ``Decimal("26")`` while
``budget.pay_schedule.cadence_days`` is user-selectable 1..365, so this
"single canonical aggregator" produced a figure that was simply wrong for an
owner not paid biweekly.  Every case here now states the cadence it was
hand-computed at (:data:`_BIWEEKLY`) and no assertion moved.
``test_the_conversion_side_paycheck_count_has_one_producer`` is where a second
cadence is exercised end to end, and it is the regression guard that replaced
the constant's own.

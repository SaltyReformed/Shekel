        The derived payoff is the DUE date the balance first folds to

        loan folds at a date behind today.  The ruling (plan step X-q): the

        the Horizon, whose axis is today-forward, falls back to its fixed
        window for AXIS SIZING only, because
        ``savings._milestone_axis_x`` clamps a target at or before
        ``dates[0]`` to index 0.0 and the flag would be planted on "Today".

        The state is exercised by asking the domain resolver about a ``today``
        past every payoff, which is what the producer's own signature allows

        is the branch that CHANGED**: the rule it replaced dropped past
        payoffs per loan and then read the empty list as "no loans at all",
        so it returned ``is_loan_free=True`` for a borrower whose loan had
        not cleared.

        **Plan step X-q2 made that answer unreachable from here rather than
        merely correct.**  The resolver no longer returns a loan-free flag at
        all, and the outlook that does own one takes no reader ``today`` to
        filter payoffs on -- so a reader's clock can size an axis and can
        decide whether a flag is drawable, and it can no longer decide whether

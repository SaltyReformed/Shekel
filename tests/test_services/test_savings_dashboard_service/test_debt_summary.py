    """Tests for ``DebtSummary.principal_paid_fraction`` (Loop B B-1, X-u).

    The debt track marker's figure: the aggregate fraction of original loan
    principal paid down so far.  Per
    the 2026-06-12 ruling (``dashboard_card_audit.md`` Rebuild decisions
    item 4) it sums over ALL loans ever originated -- paid-off loans stay
    in both the numerator and the denominator -- so the fraction is
    monotonic, reaches exactly ``1`` at full payoff, and stays there.

    It was its own narrow producer (``compute_debt_principal_progress``) until
    plan step X-u, which folded it into the summary that the same consumer
    already reads: one dashboard render was running the whole load -> params ->
    project pipeline TWICE, once per debt producer (finding N-109).  These
    tests read the summary field, which is what the dashboard reads.

    ``original_principal`` is a NOT NULL, ``> 0`` column, so any ORIGINATED
    loan supplies the denominator.  "No loans at all" is not a case here --
    there is no summary to carry the field then, which
    ``TestDebtSummary::test_narrow_producer_none_when_no_loans`` already pins.

    Ruling R-BI declined to merge the principal-paid producer into the debt

    at a measured cost of 19 years (finding N-98, where a debt-free caption
    derived over the owed-today set reported the date the OTHER loans finish).
    X-u merged them anyway, having first measured that both rules are REDUCERS
    over one projection rather than two loan sets -- and this is the fixture
    that would catch a merge that re-decided either one.

    Three loans, chosen so the three sets are pairwise DIFFERENT:

    * **A, owing** -- $1,000.00 originated 2026-01-01, trued up to a known
      $400.00.  In owed-today AND in all-loans-ever AND on the debt line.
    * **B, retired** -- $1,000.00 originated 2026-01-01, trued up to $0.00.
      OUT of owed-today (it owes nothing) and OFF the debt line (retired), but
      IN all-loans-ever, contributing its full principal as repaid.
    * **C, unborrowed** -- a $200,000.00 mortgage originating 2026-04-15,
      after this module's frozen 2026-03-20 today.  OUT of owed-today and OUT
      of all-loans-ever (nothing of it has been repaid because none of it has
      been borrowed), but ON the debt line, whose whole 30 years are ahead.

    So owed-today is ``{A}``, all-loans-ever is ``{A, B}``, and the debt line

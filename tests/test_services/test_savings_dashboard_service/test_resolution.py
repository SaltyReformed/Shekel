    exist.  ``_data._load_loan_params_and_escrow`` builds ``loan_params_map`` from
    the accounts whose TYPE carries ``has_amortization`` -- the SAME flag
    ``classify_account`` branches on -- so a drifted account never enters the map,
    never gets ``loan_params`` in its projection dict, and is therefore skipped by
    the domain and the milestones exactly as the band skips it.  One flag, one
    answer, three consumers.

    """A user with no baseline scenario gets ONE answer, not five blank tiles.

    Plan step X-v2 (rulings R-BW / R-BZ / R-CA), REVERSING plan step X-t2's
    ruling that this region should degrade in place.  The developer confirmed
    the expected behaviour changed (CLAUDE.md rule 5); this docstring is where
    that reversal is findable from the tests.

    **What X-t2 shipped and why it was wrong.**  It gave the region one
    no-baseline door returning the "today figures over an empty series".  Those
    today figures were ``compute_net_worth_today`` reducing
    ``current_balance or ZERO`` over balances that were ALL ``None`` -- so a
    user whose every balance the app cannot answer was told their net worth,
    total assets and total liabilities were exactly ``$0.00`` (finding N-113).
    Seven reducers in this package made that same substitution, and four other
    surfaces answered the same state four other ways, two of them by
    fabricating a figure and three of them with a 500.

    **What replaces it.**  The seam raises
    :class:`~app.exceptions.BaselineMissingError` and ONE application-level
    handler answers: the setup-recovery card for a page, ``204`` for an HTMX
    fragment.  ``AccountProjection.current_balance`` stopped being nullable in
    the same commit, so the seven fabrications are gone with the state that
    produced them.

    Unreachable in production -- ``registration_service.register_user`` writes a
    baseline for every owner, nothing deletes or un-baselines one, and no path
    promotes a companion to owner -- which is precisely why it needs tests:
    nothing else would ever execute it.  The end-to-end arms live in
    ``tests/test_routes/test_no_baseline_policy.py``, which sweeps every route

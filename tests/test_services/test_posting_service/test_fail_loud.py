        ``test_settle_missing_income_shadow_fails_loud``.**  The one-entry
        writer read the INCOME shadow's record for the pair and REFUSED when
        it was missing; shape C has no pair to read -- each side's movement
        posts on its own, against transit -- so a pair with one side is the
        in-transit state: money left Checking and has not arrived.  Transfer
        Invariant 1 (two shadows) is the transfer service's and the integrity
        checks' to police, not the ledger writer's, which neither refuses nor
        fabricates the missing side.

        Arithmetic: from a ledger the teardown brought to zero (both sides
        posted and reversed: transit 0.00), the income shadow is removed and
        the sync runs: it emits ONE entry, {Checking -100, transit +100}, and

        flight.  (The to-side's earlier entries survive as a net-zero pair
        whose links the raw delete SET-NULLed; the readers drop unlinked
        residue.)  The leaf's adversarial review found the first cut reading
        back the entry the SETTLE had written; this grades the sync's own.

        **The half pair is STAGED inside the save since plan step
        ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``** (ruling **R-BAL167** class 2): the to-side's
        record hangs off the TRANSFER since that step, so removing the income
        shadow no longer removes it, and a settled transfer holding ONE
        side's record is refused at COMMIT (the band rule).  The record comes
        off by its side link beside the shadow, the sync runs and is read

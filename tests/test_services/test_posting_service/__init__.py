"""Tests for ``posting_service`` (Build-Order Steps 2 and 3).

``posting_service`` is the sole go-forward writer of the double-entry posting
ledger.  Step 2 posts settled **transfers**
(:func:`~app.services.posting_service.sync_transfer_postings`); Step 3 (Commit
4) adds settled ordinary **cash transactions**
(:func:`~app.services.posting_service.sync_transaction_postings`).  Both
reconcile a source's net posted ledger effect to a target by emitting one
balanced delta journal entry, idempotently.
:func:`~app.services.posting_service.account_posting_total`,
:func:`~app.services.posting_service.settled_transfer_effect`, and
:func:`~app.services.posting_service.posted_purchase_effect` are the
reconciliation helpers the oracle consumes (the transaction source's own,
``settled_transaction_effect``, went at plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a``).

The transfer tests pin the load-bearing properties with hand-computed
arithmetic.  **A settled transfer is TWO entries since plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-3``** (rulings **R-BAL45** and **R-BAL101**): one per side's
covering movement, on that movement's own day, each against the owner's
Transfers-in-transit account -- ``{from -amount, transit +amount}`` and
``{to +amount, transit -amount}`` -- so every figure a real account's ledger
carries below is what it was under the one-entry shape, and the transit account
nets to zero per transfer.  The cases that read "the transfer's entry" were
re-expressed for the pair when the shape moved (each docstring says how);
every per-real-account figure is unchanged:

  * **Sign + balance** -- a settle posts ``-amount`` on the from-account's
    ledger and ``+amount`` on the to-account's, each against transit, each
    entry summing to zero; the rule is class-independent (asset->asset AND
    asset->liability).
  * **Effective amount, not transfer amount** -- a settled shadow's RECORD
    (its covering movement's figure) overrides the nominal transfer amount
    (the value the balance calculator and the oracle use).
  * **Idempotency** -- a repeat sync computes ``delta = 0`` and writes
    nothing.
  * **Reversal reads the ledger** -- a revert / delete negates exactly what
    was posted, not the (possibly-edited) transfer amount; a revert ->
    edit-amount -> re-settle posts the new amount.
  * **Reconciliation** -- the per-account posting total equals the
    settled-shadow effect, and both net to zero after a reversal.
  * **Fail loud** -- a ``None`` scenario, a missing ledger-account pairing,
    and an unbalanced set of legs each raise :class:`PostingError`.

The transfer states are built through ``transfer_service`` (the sole transfer
writer, via the ``create_settled_transfer`` helper), so every shadow obeys
the transfer invariants exactly as production produces them.  Commit 5 wires
``posting_service`` into that service, so settling a transfer already
auto-posts its ledger entry; the settle tests below read that auto-posted
entry back, while the idempotency / reversal tests still invoke
``posting_service`` directly to prove a re-sync no-ops or reverses.

The Step-3 transaction tests (the ``TestTransaction*`` /
``TestSettledTransactionEffect`` classes at the foot of the file) cover the
plan's one cash-effect formula -- ``effective - Sigma(credit entries)``, signed
``+`` income / ``-`` expense -- with hand-computed worked examples (plain
income/expense, the debit-only envelope effect, the all-credit no-op), the
correct-by-construction reconcile (idempotency; reversal; the 2.8 CRITICAL
revert -> recategorize -> re-settle, proven at the service layer), counter-leg
routing into the per-category / Uncategorized-fallback account, the transfer-
shadow no-op guard, and fail-loud.  Step 3 has no service wiring yet (that is
Commit 6), so these tests build settled rows via direct ORM and invoke
``sync_transaction_postings`` directly.

**Absolute totals since Build-Order Step 5 (C6).**  ``create_account`` posts
each fixture account's OPENING anchor correction at create time (the seed
Checking's $1000.00, the ledger-suite Savings' $100.00 sentinel), and the
effect-time self-heal at the sync tails keeps those corrections current, so
``account_posting_total`` is an ABSOLUTE balance: ``latest anchor +
post-assertion settled effects``.  A settle dated today (the helper default)
rides on top of the opening; a settle dated in
the 2024 bootstrap period is attributed BEFORE the origination assertion and
is absorbed into the opening delta instead (the total returns to the anchor).
The ``settled_*_effect`` source-table readers are unchanged.

    """C-20 / F-007: ``resolve_conflicts`` refused to mutate a transfer shadow
    transaction (``transfer_id IS NOT NULL``), closing CLAUDE.md Transfer
    invariant 4 for this loop.

    The guard (``app/services/recurrence_engine/_conflicts.py``) is
    unreachable since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``: a transaction naming
    a transfer is refused at the INSERT (``ck_transactions_names_no_transfer``,
    graded by ``tests/test_models/test_a_transfer_is_one_row.py``'s
    ``test_the_database_refuses_a_twin``), and the guard goes with the column at
    ``balance:X-bi-6-5``.  The two cases that drove it were deleted at plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` (ruling **R-BAL320**):
    ``test_update_action_on_shadow_raises_validation_error`` planted the
    refused row, and ``test_cross_user_shadow_silently_skipped`` read two
    things.  Its nothing-written read is ``TestResolveConflicts``'s
    ``test_cross_user_update_blocked`` on a regular row, which fails first when
    the cross-user skip's ``continue`` is dropped (measured).  Its no-raise read
    graded the ORDER -- the cross-user skip before this guard -- which no state
    can show without a twin, so it goes unchecked until ``balance:X-bi-6-5``
    deletes the guard.  The deleted case read no access event; the warning is
    logged before the ``continue``, so dropping it leaves
    ``tests/test_services/test_service_log_events/test_the_period_and_recurrence_events.py``'s
    ``test_resolve_conflicts_cross_user_emits_access_event`` passing (measured).
    The control below stays.

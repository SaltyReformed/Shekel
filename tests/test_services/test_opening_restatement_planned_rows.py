"""The books may not be restated past a still-projected recurring row (ruling R-PC88).

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``.  Ruling **R-PC85** made a recurring
definition's occurrences start above the books of every account it moves money
in, compared on the row's due day with a day ON the opening inside it (ruling
**R-PC86**).  So moving an account's books LATER past a recurring row that is
still Projected -- an unpaid, overdue bill the rule generated -- would leave
that row answering an occurrence the walk drops, and a maintain pass that
reaches its paycheck retires such a row, raising the forecast without a word.  Josh ruled the door refuses instead (2026-09-22, "Refuse the move"): the
owner marks the row paid, cancels it or moves it, then restates the books.

Each account here is built with :func:`~tests._test_helpers.account_never_asserted`
and an opening placed before the seeded schedule (2026-01-02 onward), so the
restatement's OTHER record rules -- movements, matched lines, assertions --
have nothing to refuse and the planned-row rule is the one graded.

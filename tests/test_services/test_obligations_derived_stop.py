"""
Shekel Budget App -- the obligations aggregator reads the DESTINATION's stop
(plan step R7d-e).

The money cases of that step, beside ``test_obligations_aggregator`` rather
than inside it because that module is at its line ceiling.  A loan payment
stops when its loan does, and until this step the only way that fact reached
the ``/obligations`` and ``/savings`` totals was a CACHE: ten chokepoints wrote
the loan's derived payoff into ``budget.recurrence_rules.end_date``, the
authored bound's own column, and ``recurrence.has_ended`` read that column.
So a retired loan's payment stayed in the Recurring surface's totals and the
emergency-fund floor until some chokepoint happened to run, and left on the
day it did -- a fact about when a page was saved rather than about the loan.

The aggregator reads the composed door now (ruling **R-R56** makes the door
read the app-written column as the cache it is), and the derived stop answers
"has this ended" under ruling **R-R57**: the definition owes no occurrence on
or after the day asked.  **Every case here is one direction of the money.**  A
loan that is FINISHED leaves both totals (the inflating direction); a loan
whose cached bound is EARLIER than its payoff stays in them (the understating
direction, plan ledger row **D35**'s shape, and the more dangerous of the two).

The fixture loan is ``$12,000.00`` at 5% over 24 months; its MONTHLY
``$200.00`` payment is ``200 * 12 / (1 * 12) = $200.00`` a month while it
commits anything.  Today is frozen mid-2026 so the loan fixtures do not drift
with the calendar, and every pass is pinned to a day the case names.

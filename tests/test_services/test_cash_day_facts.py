"""
Shekel Budget App -- The cash fold read at DAY grain, split into its tiers.

Pins ``balance_at.cash_daily_facts_series`` and the fold behind it (plan step
**bank_import:X-f6e-2**).  A reader comparing this account against a record
kept OUTSIDE the app -- the bank's own statement -- needs a day's MOVEMENT
split three ways, because a balance difference alone cannot tell the three
apart and they mean different things: money the app's rows say moved, a
balance the owner ASSERTED, and a plan that has not happened.

**The load-bearing property is the identity**::

    balance(d) - balance(d - 1) == recorded(d) + asserted(d) + planned(d)

It holds by construction today -- ``_running_steps`` assembles exactly
``dated_deltas`` plus the opening's compensator plus the planned nets -- and
this suite exists because that is a property of TODAY's assembly rather than of
the contract.  A fourth tier joining the running total with no entry here would
otherwise be absorbed silently into whichever component a consumer derived by
subtraction, and labelled as something it is not.

**The OPENING assertion is the case worth naming.**  Ruling R-I moves its
correction into the SEED and books an equal-and-opposite step on its own day,
so its net contribution there is ZERO: the figure it establishes is part of the
level every later day is measured from, not money moving that day.  Deriving
``asserted`` from the walk's corrections without excluding it puts the opening's
whole delta on its day -- ``$798.03`` on the developer's real account -- and the
identity above is what catches it.

Scenario: the ``seed_periods`` biweekly calendar from 2026-01-02, whose account
opens with a $1000.00 assertion.

        The codebase has measured what the alternative costs: before plan step
        X-c2b2 the cash scalar and the cash series were separate producers of
        one quantity and stood ``$15.96`` apart on the real Checking account.
        Both entries here sample ``(folded.seed, folded.steps)`` through the
        same :func:`sample_cumulative`, so this asserts a property rather than
        maintaining an agreement -- and it is the assertion that notices if one
        of them ever grows its own assembly.

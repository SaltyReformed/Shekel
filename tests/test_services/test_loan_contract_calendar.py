"""A loan's ONE charge calendar: the contract's installments, through a stream's last event.

Plan step **recurrence:R16-c-2** (rulings **R-R72**, **R-R89** and **R-R100**).
A loan is charged on EVERY contractual installment from origination, whether or
not a payment lands on it, in the posted ledger's walk and a screen's alike:
:func:`~app.services.installment_calendar.installment_dates` is the one date producer,
:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger._charges.contract_charges` prices each date, and
:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.with_contract_charges` is the one composer
that decides how far a stream is charged -- through its LAST event, a payment,
an assertion or a projection alike.

Pure: no database, no app context.  Every figure is stated by hand and checked
against :func:`~app.utils.money.accrue_monthly_interest` /
:func:`~app.utils.money.apply_payment_cash`, the ONE accrual and the ONE
allocation (6% on $10,000.00 is $50.00 a month).

"""Tests for plan step credit_card:CC-5-5c -- ONE sign for every balance.

Ruling **R-CC47** ("A: one sign"): every balance is what the account HOLDS,
negative when owed -- a configured loan included, whose seam arms reported the
owed figure until this step -- and what an account owes is
:func:`app.services.liability_sign.owed` of it.  Net worth is the plain sum of
every balance; the liability surfaces read ``owed()`` where they took ``abs()``
(ledger row **CC-354**, ruling **R-CC48** for the group subtotal); every loan
screen and liability tile shows what is owed.  Ruling **R-CC67** (with R-CC53,
ledger row CC-362) puts an archived debt's figure on the same calculation, and
ruling **R-CC68** (ledger row CC-361) captions the footer's figure "with no
payoff date".

New module rather than an append to ``test_savings_dashboard_service.py`` or
``test_balance_at.py``: concurrent lanes add to those files too, and two
end-of-file appends conflict (the coordinator's instruction, 2026-09-23).

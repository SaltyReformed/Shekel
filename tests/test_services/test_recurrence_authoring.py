"""The recurrence write door and the writers routed through it (R2c, R2d).

``tests/test_services/test_recurrence_resolution.py`` covers the pure
derivation.  This file covers what it means for the application to have ONE
write door: that every path which creates or changes a rule goes through it,
and that what each writer INTENDED is what the rule resolves to afterwards.

Two invariants run through it.

* **Authoring is idempotent.**  Reading a rule's spec back and re-authoring it
  changes no column (:func:`assert_reauthoring_changes_nothing`).  That is
  what makes "a caller owning one fact replaces that fact and re-authors" a
  safe idiom rather than a rewrite with side effects.
* **A rule always resolves, completely.**  Every pattern the application can
  author produces a whole :class:`~app.services.recurrence.ResolvedRecurrence`
  (:func:`assert_resolves_completely`), which is the property plan step R7c's
  NOT NULL columns will rest on.

**What this file no longer asserts, and why.**  Before plan step R2d the
invariant was "a rule's two-axis COLUMNS are always the resolution of its own
closed-set columns" -- a consistency check between two stored halves.  Those
columns are gone: the two-axis view is computed on demand, so the halves
cannot disagree and there is nothing to check.  What replaced it is stronger
and simpler -- the value is derived at every read, so the tests assert the
DERIVATION (in the resolution suite) and the AUTHORING (here), with no
consistency relation in between.

#: Every column of ``budget.recurrence_rules`` a CALLER states.  Named once so
#: :func:`authored_columns` cannot silently stop covering one that is added,
#: and pinned against the table by
#: :class:`TestTheAuthoredSurfaceIsWholeAndClosed`.
#:
#: **A caller's request decides these and nothing else does**, which is what
#: makes "re-authoring changes nothing" and "a schedule rebuild changes
#: nothing" meaningful assertions about them.
#:
#: **The list SHRANK at plan step R7c-c, and the cadence columns moved to the
#: DERIVED list rather than leaving the table.**  ``interval_n`` and ``unit_id``
#: are what a caller states, but they are not what is necessarily WRITTEN: the
#: door takes both off the ``resolve`` call, which canonicalises a whole number
#: of years authored in months onto the YEAR unit (ruling R-R17).  A column
#: whose stored value can differ from the request is derived, whatever the
#: request looks like -- and filing it here would have made
#: :func:`assert_reauthoring_changes_nothing` assert the wrong thing about it.
#: **``user_id`` LEFT this list at plan step R-F6, with the column.**  A rule's
#: owner is the definition holding it now, and
#: :attr:`~app.models.recurrence_rule.RecurrenceRule.user_id` reads through to
#: that definition's -- so it is neither authored nor derived here; it is not a
#: column at all, and the two owning FKs that replaced it are
#: :data:`_OWNING_ARC_COLUMNS`.
_AUTHORED_COLUMNS = (
    "due_day_of_month", "end_date", "max_occurrences",
)

#: The OWNING ARC: which definition this rule belongs to (plan step R-F6).
#:
#: A FOURTH category, and it is a category rather than an exception because
#: these two columns are written by a different function than every other one:
#: :func:`~app.services.recurrence.author_rule` sets them from the ``owner`` it
#: takes, through ``owner.recurrence_rule``, while ``_author`` writes the
#: cadence.  The split is deliberate -- an owner is not part of what a caller
#: AUTHORS about a recurrence, and ``reauthor_rule`` must not be able to move a
#: rule between definitions -- so the assignment census below cannot see them
#: and a behavioural proof stands in its place
#: (:meth:`TestTheAuthoredSurfaceIsWholeAndClosed.test_the_owning_arc_is_written_and_exclusive`).
#:
#: Listing them here rather than loosening an assertion is what keeps the gate
#: strict: a THIRD owning arm, or any other column added and forgotten, still
#: fails the partition because it will not be on this list.
_OWNING_ARC_COLUMNS = frozenset({
    "transaction_template_id", "transfer_template_id",
})

#: Every column the write door DERIVES, from ``resolve`` and the owner's
#: schedule rather than from the request.
#:
#: **They are a separate list because they answer a different question**, and
#: plan step R7c-a is what made the difference observable.  ``starts_on`` is the
#: first occurrence measured against the schedule the owner has NOW, so a full
#: rebuild legitimately moves it -- which ``TestScheduleRebuildRepoint``'s own
#: docstring already said about the anchor, one paragraph before this list
#: forced the two together.
#:
#: The distinction is not bookkeeping.  A derived column that failed to move
#: with its inputs would be the stale cache plan step R2d refused, and
#: :meth:`TestTheAuthoredSurfaceIsWholeAndClosed.test_the_derived_columns_equal_the_resolver`
#: is what says it moves.
#:
#: **``offset_periods`` left at plan step R7c-c** with the column: the phase is
#: derived on every read and stored nowhere.  ``interval_n`` ARRIVED in the same
#: step, from the authored list -- see it for why a canonicalised cadence makes
#: it a derived value even though a caller states it.
_DERIVED_COLUMNS = (
    "interval_n", "unit_id", "placement_id", "shift_id", "starts_on",
    "nominal_day",
)

#: The two columns the DATABASE assigns, which no caller may author: the
#: surrogate key and the insert timestamp (``CreatedAtMixin``, server default).
_DB_ASSIGNED_COLUMNS = frozenset({"id", "created_at"})

#: RETIRED columns: on the table, written by nobody, read by nobody, awaiting
#: the migration that drops them.
#:
#: A third category rather than a loosened assertion, and the distinction is
#: the point.  The census below is the gate that catches a column the write
#: door FORGOT -- one that would keep its server default forever while every
#: behavioural test passed, because a value nobody writes also never changes.
#: Naming a retired column here is what keeps that gate STRICT for everything
#: else: a column added and forgotten still fails, because it will not be on
#: this list.
#:
#: **It is EMPTY from plan step R7c-c, which is what the leaf means.**  It held
#: ``start_period_id`` (retired at R7b-4), then ``month_of_year`` and
#: ``start_date`` (retired at R7b-c) -- three columns on the table that nothing
#: wrote and nothing read, kept only because dropping a column belongs with the
#: leaf that drops the rest.  That leaf ran: every column of
#: ``budget.recurrence_rules`` is now authored, derived, or assigned by the
#: database, and there is no fourth category.  This list emptying is the
#: three-leaf expand / migrate / contract (ruling R-R18) finishing, and the
#: paragraph that used to predict it can be read in ``900e761a``.

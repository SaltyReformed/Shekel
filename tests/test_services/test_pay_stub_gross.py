"""
Shekel Budget App -- the pay stub door's printed-gross check (plan step salary:S11-b, S11-c-2b).

What :mod:`app.services.pay_stub_gross` decides through
:mod:`app.services.pay_stub_service`'s record door, graded without a request:

* the printed-GROSS check (**R-SAL99**, finding **SAL-590**, which reads the
  printed gross as base pay plus the taxable earnings): a gross typed as base
  pay is refused, and an earning moved between taxable and after-tax -- which
  moves the gross but not the net -- is refused on the gross, in both
  directions;
* the job's answer to "my stub's gross includes after-tax earnings"
  (**R-SAL102**, finding SAL-592): "yes" adds them to the checked gross, and
  cannot see an earning under the other of the two headings (the ruling's
  accepted cost);
* how a gross miss is worded, read off the net's miss beside it (**R-SAL106**,
  amending R-SAL104; **R-SAL108**, **R-SAL110**, **R-SAL111**, **R-SAL112**):
  net exact names the typed gross, and beside it R-SAL104's question and the
  setting on a "no" job short by exactly the after-tax total, the setting on
  a "yes" job over by it, else the headings on a "no" job; net off by the
  same names an amount, or -- when base pay is the printed gross -- has both
  typed totals checked and asks the base pay the stub shows, which tells the
  Base pay box from an earning the stub does not print (**R-SAL119**,
  **R-SAL120**); twice names a line on the wrong side; anything else,
  the difference.  Every message is in the plain words of **R-SAL114** to
  **R-SAL117** (the approved list, **R-SAL115**).

Split out of ``test_pay_stub_service.py`` at plan step salary:S11-c-2c
(ledger row **SAL-594**), a pure move: every class and helper below is as it
stood there.  The worked example it prices is in
``tests/test_services/_pay_stub_example.py``.

"""Tests for the loan-detail display read producers (Loop B rebuild).

:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service._display` answers the loan detail page's
posting-derived measured surfaces:

* ``confirmed_loan_payment_history`` -- the confirmed payment table, each
  payment's real cash / principal / interest / escrow split; and
* ``loan_balance_anchor_history`` -- the balance-anchors drift scorecard, each
  opening / true-up paired with the ledger's pre-correction balance.

(The interest / principal paid-YTD chips folded off the postings onto the loan
ledger at step C6c; they are pinned in ``test_loan_paid_in_year.py``.)

The fixtures are the SAME synthetic split-loan the reconciliation suites use
($250,000 @ 6%, trued up to $100,000): a $100,000 balance at 6% accrues exactly
$500.00 the first month (``100000 * 0.06 / 12``), so every expected figure is
hand-computed and shown in the docstring's arithmetic.  The trueup anchor
($100,000) differs from origination ($250,000), so a correct figure proves the
walk seeds from the trueup.  ``today`` is frozen after the seed window so every
settled payment is confirmed regardless of the wall clock.  All money is
``Decimal`` from strings.

"""R16-b-2: the ESTIMATED tier sums EVERY definition, on its own cadence, by occurrence.

Plan step **R16-b-2** (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_recurrence_redesign.md``)
and the rulings of 2026-09-11 it carries.  A loan's forward plan
(:func:`app.services.balance_at._plan.loan_plan`) is what a generate pass over
the owner's whole schedule would write, priced as those rows would be priced:

* every active recurring transfer into the loan is walked on its OWN cadence
  under its AUTHORED closing (rulings **R-R35**, **R-R36**, **R-R37**,
  **R-R65**; findings **D47**, **D48**);
* an occurrence the schedule places that NO ROW IN ANY STATE answers is
  priced from the definition, past or future, and a cancelled or deleted row
  still answers its occurrence (ruling **R-R64**, finding **D46**); an
  occurrence the schedule cannot place is neither generated nor estimated;
* an occurrence is dated as generation would date its row (**R-R69**) and
  priced through the amount model's own arm (**R-R67**), so the plan is
  INVARIANT under generation;
* the charge calendar is the CONTRACT's, seed-aware (**R-R68**; findings
  **D53**, **D54**).

Each case builds the state through the app's own doors -- the loan door's
start sync, the generate pass, the soft-delete door, the transfer create door
-- and reads the plan back, so a fixture cannot describe a state the app
cannot reach.  The companion ``test_loan_plan_assembly.py`` pins the
contract-only arm and the PLANNED tier; ``test_amount_source.py`` pins the
price a row and its estimate share.

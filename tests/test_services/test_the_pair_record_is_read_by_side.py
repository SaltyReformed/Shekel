"""What a transfer pair already RECORDS is read by SIDE, not by account (leaf ``X-bi-6-4d-1``).

The settle and the update read the pair's record -- the retained correction a
re-settle honours, the figure an echoed Actual box is compared against -- off
its expense side, through ``transfer_legs`` (``TransferRows.expense_leg``).
An update may move an endpoint AND settle in one call (``update_transfer``'s
contract; ``_endpoints._apply_endpoint_move`` names the case), and the move
assigns the transfer's account RELATIONSHIP, whose ``from_account_id`` column
reads the OLD account until a flush.  A read keyed by that column found the
record only when some lazy load happened to autoflush first; with the shadows'
``entries`` already loaded, nothing did, and the settle raised.  Keyed by the
side -- the shadow's type through the interval, the side link from
``X-bi-6-4d`` -- the read names no account at all.  The leaf's adversarial
review measured the regression (1 failed at its cp1, 3 passed on the base);
this is that case.

Which side each read takes is graded directly too
(:class:`TestEachSideReadsItsOwnRecord`): on every door-written state both
sides carry one figure and one source, so the settle and the update cannot
tell the sides apart, and the leaf's delta review measured a mutant reading
the INCOME side for both passing the full suite.

"""Tests for plan step credit_card:CC-5-5d -- goals on a DEBT, and the tile's rule.

Rulings (``rulings_cc5_5.md`` Blocks 11-12, 19-21): a goal on a debt is a
milestone to get UNDER (R-CC69), its progress runs from what the debt owed when
the goal was set (R-CC70), a debt goal may target ``$0.00`` (R-CC72), it shows
only a projected date and its pace (R-CC73), a goal never moves onto, off or
between debts (R-CC87), every figure is what the debt's /savings TILE shows
(R-CC88), a debt goal carries no per-period contribution (R-CC90), and a card or
other non-loan debt goal RECORDS its start when created while a loan goal
re-reads its own from the books (R-CC91, refining R-CC71).  Ledger row
**CC-371**: the archived list read the DAY where a live non-loan tile reads its
pay period's END.

Every loan here is a 0% loan unless a case says otherwise, so each figure it
asserts is worked by hand: no interest accrues, so a payment is all principal.

New module rather than an append to ``test_savings_dashboard_service.py``:
concurrent lanes add to that file, and two end-of-file appends conflict.

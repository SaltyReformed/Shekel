"""A reopened envelope whose lump payment a match still names takes purchases.

Finding **CC-385** (owner ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``, leaf 5c-2b) and ruling
**R-CC141** (developer 2026-10-04): *"The user should be allowed to add
purchases from various sources to an envelope. The envelope is typically the
sum of the purchases."*  Groceries is planned at `$120.00` on Checking, closed
as ONE `$120.00` payment, matched to the bank's `-$120.00` line, and set back
to Projected.  The app keeps that payment UN-DATED (ruling **R-BAL61**), so it
counts nothing on any balance, and the match still names it -- the register
shows it as no longer adding up, with its Undo.  A `$30.00` purchase under
Groceries is then money no other line explains: filing a bank line into the
envelope, or matching a purchase it already holds, counts that `$30.00` once.

Both states the review's probe measured, because the owner-wide claims scan
refused them through two different accounts: the lump paid from the VISA and
matched on the Visa's screen, and the lump paid from CHECKING and matched on
Checking's own.

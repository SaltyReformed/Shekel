"""C6c: the loan-detail paid-YTD chips fold the settled past.

Plan step **C6c** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  Direct unit
coverage of the balance seam's two paid-in-year chip producers,
:func:`app.services.balance_at.loan_interest_paid_in_year` and
:func:`~app.services.balance_at.loan_principal_paid_in_year`, which the loan-detail
"Interest paid, YTD" / "Principal paid, YTD" chips read.  Each is the SETTLED side
of the loan fold -- the interest / principal a payment's real cash actually paid,
attributed to the DISPLAY-timezone civil year of its paid date (the L9 tax basis)
-- so they replaced the posting readers the chips read before
(``confirmed_loan_interest_in_year`` / ``confirmed_loan_principal_in_year``,
deleted at C6c).

Two properties are new versus those readers and pinned here:

* they fold the loan's SOURCE events, so a COLD posting cache still answers a real
  figure where the reader returned ``None`` and hid the chip; and
* they are TOTAL -- a configured loan that paid nothing in the year folds ``0.00``,
  never ``None`` -- so the loan-detail page (which renders only for a configured
  loan) always shows the real figure.

The fixture is the synthetic split loan the reconciliation suites use ($250,000 @
6%, trued up to $100,000), so a $100,000 balance accrues exactly $500.00 the first
month (``100000 * 0.06 / 12``) and every expected figure is hand-computed and
shown in the docstring's arithmetic (never a producer as its own oracle, plan
N-7).  ``today`` is frozen after the seed window so every settled payment is
confirmed regardless of the wall clock.  All money is ``Decimal`` from strings.

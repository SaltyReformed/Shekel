"""X-c1: the cash PERIOD VIEW -- one row set, two clocks, one named remainder.

Plan step X-c1 (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``, ruling R-K).
Grades ``app.services.balance_at._cash_periods.period_view_of`` -- the producer
plan step X-c2 points the grid's balance row, its subtotal rows and its two
remainder rows at.  The view is ADDITIVE here: no production surface reads
it yet, so nothing in this file can move a shipped balance.

**The identity is the point, and it is asserted against an INDEPENDENT fold.**
For every period::

    balance(p.end) - balance(p.start - 1 day)
        == net[p] + period_timing[p] + book_vs_bank[p]

**The remainder is TWO figures here, and that is ruling R-DH (f)** (plan step
S1-c).  It was one field, ``reconciliation``, summing two facts with different
causes and different fixes: money landing in a different column from the one it
was budgeted to (``period_timing``), and the gap between what the app had
recorded and what the bank actually held (``book_vs_bank``).  Every assertion
below that read the single field now names WHICH half carries the figure and
pins the other at ``$0.00`` -- which is strictly sharper, because the old form
could not tell a timing error from a true-up and each of these fixtures produces
exactly one of the two.

The left side is sampled from ``balances_at`` -- the X-b producer, graded
on its own hand-computed oracle -- and the right side is the view's grouping of
the same rows.  Neither is derived from the other: the view computes its
remainder from the row set (what MOVED in the column minus what was BUDGETED to
it, plus the assertions), never as ``balance_delta - net``, precisely so this
assertion can fail (plan Section 7.2 -- a residual proving itself is the
forbidden shape).

**Every expected figure below is HAND-COMPUTED and written out in the test that
asserts it**, per component: the basis change, TIMING (a row settled outside its
own column), the TRUE-UP (a balance assertion), the CLAMP (ruling R-G moving an
overdue plan forward), and the OPENING that must book nothing (ruling R-I).
Where a figure exists in the shipping producer it is asserted too, so the basis
change is shown as a measured difference rather than claimed.

        **The measurement that deleted pay_calendar C3-b's coverage rule**
        (developer ruling 2026-08-11).  That rule refused any schedule write
        which moved a day from covered to uncovered underneath a settled row,
        on the claim that stranding one reproduces ``balance:N-128``.  It does
        not, and the shape below is the one a truncate actually leaves: a
        CONTIGUOUS prefix of the schedule, with a settled row filed inside it
        whose money moved after the prefix ends.

        Reports periods 0-2 (2026-01-02 to 2026-02-12) with a ``$250.00``
        expense budgeted to period 2 and settled 2026-03-20 -- past the last
        reported ``end_date``, exactly as it would be after truncating the tail
        away.

        Hand-computed.  Periods 0 and 1 hold nothing: every figure ``$0.00``
        against a ``$1,000.00`` balance.  Period 2 budgets the ``$250.00``
        (net ``-$250.00``) while nothing moves inside its span, so its
        ``period_timing`` is ``+$250.00`` and the two cancel.  Its balance is
        ``$1,000.00`` and NOT ``$750.00``, and that is the financial claim: on
        2026-02-12 the bank had genuinely not taken the money yet, so a
        schedule that stops there is right to show it unspent.  The money is
        not lost either -- reported over the FULL ten periods it lands in
        period 5, whose span contains 2026-03-20.

        ``_period_balances`` sampling at each period's OWN ``end_date`` is what
        makes this cancel: the fact is absent from both sides of the identity.
        Only a day in a HOLE between two reported columns fails to cancel, and
        the derivation ``pay_period_write`` materialises TILES, so no writer can
        produce one -- which is the whole reason the refusal had nothing left to
        protect.

        **A still-PROJECTED row rides along, and an adversarial review asked
        for it**: after a real truncate the reader's ``as_of`` is past the new
        horizon, so ruling R-G clamps every unpaid row to ``as_of + 1`` and
        lands it outside every column too.  The ``$100.00`` bill below is that
        second cause, in the SAME cell as the stranded settled row -- which is

        Period 1 (2026-01-16..01-29) is deleted outright, which is the shape a
        hole actually takes: the paydays either side survive and nothing covers
        the days between.  A ``$250.00`` expense budgeted to period 0 settles
        2026-01-20, inside the vacated span.

        Hand-computed.  The derivation gives period 0 the span
        2026-01-02..2026-01-29 -- its end is the day before the NEXT surviving
        payday -- so the settle is inside its own column: net ``-$250.00``,
        ``period_timing`` ``$0.00``, and a balance of ``$750.00`` at 01-29.
        Reading the stored spans, 01-20 fell in the hole and was counted by no
        column at all, leaving period 0's balance change unexplained by
        ``$250.00``.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- The per-user write lock, graded where it is taken (plan steps X-f1c3c, balance:X-bn)

Grades the lock that serialises every posting-ledger reconcile, every anchor
and opening compare-then-append, and every structural pay-period mutation for
one owner (:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`).

**What broke without it, measured.**  A reconcile is a read-modify-write:
read what the ledger has posted, subtract it from what the account's facts
say it should hold, write the difference.  With the interleave forced at the
read, two concurrent true-ups on an account reconciled at ``$4,000.00`` both
answered 200 and left the account's linked ledger at ``$1,000.00`` while its
resolved assertion read ``$2,000.00``.  Both sides wrong; the trial balance
still ``$0.00``, because the anchor-equity leg mirrors the error exactly, so
nothing failed loudly.  That forced-interleave probe cannot be kept as a test:
once the lock exists the second request blocks at it, so the probe's own
mechanism is what the fix removes.  These tests grade the lock instead.

**Where it is graded moved with where it is taken** (plan step
``balance:X-bn``, rulings **R-CC106**, **R-CC114**, **R-CC115**).  Until then
each reconcile and anchor door took the lock for itself, and this module
called those services directly and graded each one's acquisition.  Now no
service takes it: every command transaction a signed-in request opens takes
it where it begins (:mod:`app.db_transaction`), and a service called outside a
request takes none -- which ``tests/test_arch/test_the_owner_lock_has_one_home.py``
enforces.  So every property below is graded on a REAL REQUEST through the
door production uses, and the same five properties survive the move:

1. **The lock is taken, and taken BEFORE the owner's data is read.**  A lock
   acquired after the read serialises nothing -- the loser has already read the
   same pre-state.  Graded as strongly as the design allows: every statement
   the request issues before the lock reads the signed-in user's own row and
   nothing else, and the door's own reads (the ledger, the governing
   assertion, the opening, the movements) are asserted to happen at all, so
   the ordering cannot pass over a run that read nothing.
2. **The signed-in user's row is read AGAIN under the lock**, because it was
   the one row read before it (:func:`app.db_transaction._lock_the_open_transaction`).
3. **A render takes no lock; its write block does** (ruling **R-CC114**).  A
   plain page load runs ``READ ONLY`` and takes nothing; ``/grid``'s rolling
   top-up runs in a ``write_transaction`` block, a command transaction, which
   takes the owner's key once.
4. **It really serialises.**  A second transaction holding the same key blocks
   a save, and the same save completes when the key is free.  The only
   property that grades PostgreSQL's behaviour rather than our SQL.
5. **It is keyed on the OWNER**: one distinct key per request however much it
   writes, a companion's request takes its linked owner's key, and the
   deploy's every-owner form acquires ascending.  **That is NOT "deadlock is
   structurally impossible on every path"**: the deploy transaction takes the
   owners' keys after its migrations' table locks, which is safe only because
   the entrypoint runs it before gunicorn serves (the module docstring of
   :mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`).

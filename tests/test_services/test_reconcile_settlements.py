"""
Shekel Budget App -- The card's reconcile panel lists the bill it paid (plan step credit_card:CC-5-4b)

Ruling **R-CC44**: the reconcile panel gains a list of UN-DATED payments on
the statement's account whose row is planned on ANOTHER account -- a bill
planned on Checking, marked paid from the card and then reopened, its payment
KEPT on the card with no date (rulings **R-CC42**, **R-BAL61**).  It is the
transaction arm's second scope (``reconcile_service._transactions``), headed
"Paid from this account" (**R-CC111**), and every rule it answers to is
graded here:

* the scope, a case per direction of each clause: the row on another account
  (not this one), a payment un-dated (not dated) and on THIS account (not a
  third), no purchase held (**R-CC113**), not a transfer shadow, Projected,
  and the bill's own landing day (**R-CC118**);
* the offer: priced, boxed (**R-CC110**) and posted (**R-CC116**) exactly as
  the row's own list does, worded per **R-CC111** / **R-CC117**, and an
  envelope's tick closing it (**R-CC119**);
* the tick: the row settles on the statement's day with its payment where it
  is, and the statement's link reaches the payment and NOT the row --
  ``status_seam.record_clearing``'s one rule, a statement of account X links
  every fact on X.

The worked example throughout is the rulings' own: Groceries `$120.00`
planned on Checking, paid from the card, reopened.

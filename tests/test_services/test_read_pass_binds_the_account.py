"""X-i4: a read pass BINDS the account it values, and memoizes what it derives.

Plan step **X-i4** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md`` section 5),
closing finding **N-354**.

**What the defect was.**  ``_cash_fold.assemble`` and its four siblings took the
account and the pass's own derivations -- ``ctx.amounts()``, ``ctx.as_of``,
``ctx.reported_periods()`` -- as INDEPENDENT arguments.  They agreed only
because every call site happened to name one ``ctx`` two or three times, and
:class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext` pinned a ``user_id`` it never
checked against the account handed alongside.  The seam cited "an argument a
caller can get wrong is a defect, not a contract" in three places and then
reproduced the shape.

**Where the rule lives now, and why THERE.**  ``_context._memoize_once`` is the
one primitive that creates state keyed by ``account.id`` on a pass, so the
binding is a precondition of creating that state rather than a guard repeated at
each of the five funnels.  A funnel added later cannot forget a check it never
had to remember, and the four readings in ``_cash_fold`` now take the assembled
record and carry no account and no clock at all -- there is nothing left for a
caller to pair wrongly.

**It is NOT a second ownership gate**, and these tests are written so that
distinction stays visible.  Whether a REQUESTER may see an account is decided
upstream, where an untrusted id becomes a row.  What is graded here is whether an
account and a pass describe ONE READ -- a question no route can ask, because no
route knows a context exists, and one that a service-tier caller with no
``current_user`` at all (``debt_strategy``, ``tax_report_service``,
``loan_recurrence_sync``) could get wrong with two perfectly ownership-checked
objects.

:class:`TestWhatAMisPairingWouldHavePublished` is the one to read first: it
builds the disclosure the refusal prevents, from the same fixtures, so the stake
is executable rather than asserted in prose.

The primitive's OWN cases -- the refusal on a warm cache, that a refused build
never runs, that nothing is stored -- live beside its membership and
raising-build cases in ``test_loan_plan_assembly.py``, where ``_memoize_once``
was already graded.

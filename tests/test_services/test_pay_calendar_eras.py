"""
Shekel Budget App -- the pay calendar's ERA readers (plan step C17-b-2).

Rulings **R-PC66** and **R-PC72** (developer, 2026-09-11): a pay schedule is
a sequence of eras, an era governs from its first payday to the next era's,
and every reader of the calendar anchors on the phase of the era covering its
own day rather than on a recorded cash payday.  This module grades the
producers that rule is built from -- :mod:`app.services.pay_calendar._eras` --
and the piecewise projection over them, which no other suite drives across a
seam between two eras.

Three things are pinned here that the derivation and value suites cannot see:

* **the matching rule** -- a recorded payday stands for the planned payday
  NEAREST to it, a tie exactly half a cadence off going to the LATER one --
  against a brute-force listing of the grid rather than the producer's loop;
* **the seam** -- the next era's first payday REPLACES the old era's last
  planned payday at or before it (ruling **R-PC75**, plan step ``C17-c-2b``,
  revising R-PC72's clause), measured in CASH days, so a day is never paid
  twice and never left in no paycheck where two conventions meet, and the
  projection reproduces what the regenerate that minted the later era wrote;
* **the ordinal** -- a projected ``period_index`` continues the saved sequence
  across the seam by exactly the number of paydays between.

The projection sweep at the bottom is a brute-force reference: it LISTS every
era's cash paydays inside its window and walks
:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar._views.projected_paychecks` against the list,
over randomised era sequences whose seams the write door's floor would admit.

**No date here is read from a clock.**  Every date is a literal or is derived
from one by explicit arithmetic, so these pass identically under
``TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati`` and the weekly ``SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY`` sweep
(``docs/test-suite-clocks.md``).

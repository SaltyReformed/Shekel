Shekel Budget App -- Cash Ledger: anchor FACT tests (Commit 4 / E-19)

Tests for ``app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_anchor`` (the dated anchor SoT),
which lives in the leaf's ``_facts`` submodule.  Renamed twice, each time
following the code: ``test_balance_resolver_anchor.py`` -> ``test_cash_events.py``
at plan step D1a (which split the anchor out of ``balance_resolver`` into the
module owning the balance fold's INPUT facts), then to this name at D1c, when
those facts became one submodule of the ``cash_ledger`` package.

The leaf's other two concerns now have their own suites, one per submodule --
what one row is WORTH in ``test_cash_amounts.py`` and what a set of rows SUMS
TO in ``test_cash_flows.py`` -- which is the relocation this docstring used to
anticipate as "its own commit".  It happened at plan step X-c2c2, and the
promotion it named happened with it: ``tests/_test_helpers.add_entry`` gained
the three bucket flags those tests need, so neither suite carries a private
entry builder.  This file is the FACTS file, and only that.

The resolver reads the most recent ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row as the
dated source of truth for E-19.  It is the ONE answer to "what balance has
this account been asserted to hold" since plan step X-f1c3a, which deleted
the ``Account.current_anchor_*`` cache columns it used to be reconciled
against.  These tests lock the contract:

  * the latest history row wins, even when more than one exists;
  * "latest" is the latest BUSINESS day -- an assertion observed EARLIER but
    RECORDED later is not the current one (the ordering the whole partition
    turns on, and which nothing pinned until X-f1c3a);
  * the day it reports is the SAME day
    :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.reconciled_through` reports, which three
    "as of" captions depend on since ruling R-EP;
  * the resolver never returns ``None`` for a factory-built account
    (Commit 3 invariant);
  * the returned ``balance`` is a 2-decimal-place ``Decimal``;
  * a zero anchor balance is preserved verbatim per E-12 (zero is a
    value, not "missing").

Test IDs match the remediation plan's Commit 4 specification (C4-1
through C4-6); C4-2 and C4-4 were re-pointed at X-f1c3a when the cache they
graded and the ``scenario_id`` parameter they exercised were deleted.

"""What an account's own BOOKS cannot explain -- plan step balance:X-f3c-3.

``balance_at.cash_outstanding_difference``: the owner's latest declared
balance, less what the account's books produce for that same day (its stored
opening equity plus every posting dated on or before it).

**The load-bearing case is** ``TestItIsOneFigureAndNotThePerAssertionPlug``,
and it is ruling **R-FN**'s own argument made a test.  Each true-up's
correction is DEFINED as whatever forces the ledger to the balance just
declared, so consecutive corrections telescope: a producer that answered with
the LAST correction, or with the largest, would be reporting the difference
between two of the owner's successive guesses.  That class was measured on
production Checking 2026-04-15, where three balances recorded in one day with
no transaction between them read ``-$45.86`` against the previous entry and
``-$92.29`` against the records.  The case below builds ``+$1,000.00`` and
``-$1,000.00`` corrections whose net is ``$0.00`` and asserts BOTH -- so the
one-figure derivation is graded against the per-assertion one rather than
merely described as different from it.

**The second control is** ``TestTheBooksSideIsNotTheShippingFOLD``.  An
assertion RESETS the cash walk, so ``cash_balance_at`` on a day that carries
one answers with that assertion and a difference measured against it is zero by
construction.  The books side must therefore be the POST-CUTOVER function --
plan step X-f3c-5's ``opening equity + SUM(postings <= T)`` -- and that test
puts the two side by side on one day where they differ by ``$150.00``.

**Measured against a producer that shares no code with this one.**  On a clone
of the dev database migrated to head, 2026-09-01, the developer's Checking
account answers ``$2,370.02`` -- ``$2,501.31`` asserted for 2026-08-18 against
``$131.29`` of books -- and the persisted double-entry ledger, written by
``account_posting_service``, independently carries ``$2,370.02`` of
``account_trueup`` postings on that account's linked ledger account against
``-$2,370.02`` on ``Checking -- Opening`` equity.  That equity leg is finding
**N-171**.

        there.  Every figure is LEDGER-NATIVE, so an owed balance is NEGATIVE

        The books open at ``-$200.00`` owed; a ``$50.00`` purchase settles,

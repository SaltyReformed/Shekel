"""Plan step X-au-g-2c-3a: a loan's cash is divided in exactly ONE place.

Finding **N-409** was not a typo in one branch.  Four producers each stated
"cash covers interest and escrow first, the rest pays the debt down", and one of
them -- ``loan_payment_service._engine_prep``'s escrow floor -- disagreed, so a
``$1,700.00`` payment against a ``$1,910.95`` installment read as exactly on
schedule while the balance seam put the owner ``$210.95`` further behind.

**The duplication was FORCED BY THE LAYERING rather than chosen**, which is what
these tests pin.  The rule lived in ``loan_ledger._split`` (import closure 23
modules); ``amortization_engine`` (closure 2) and ``rate_period_engine``
(closure 3) sit BELOW it, so reaching it was the cycle ``loan_ledger._split ->
rate_period_engine -> amortization_engine``.  Each restated it instead.  The
remedy was to move :func:`~app.utils.money.apply_payment_cash` down beside
:func:`~app.utils.money.accrue_monthly_interest` -- the CHARGE half, shared from
that leaf since E-24 -- so both halves of a loan payment's arithmetic are
reachable from every walk.

Two properties are pinned, and they fail for different reasons:

* :class:`TestEveryWalkAllocatesThroughTheOneRule` -- each producer's split
  EQUALS the shared rule's over a swept input space.  It fails if a producer
  restates the rule, however subtly.
* :class:`TestTheAllocationSitsBelowEveryWalk` -- the shared rule is still
  reachable from every walk.  It fails if the rule is moved back up, which is
  the state that MADE restating it necessary.  A green first class with a red
  second one means the duplication is about to be re-forced.

"""B2: the reference fold is the oracle, and it is exhaustive.

Plan step B2 (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  Parallel-runs
the loan fold (:func:`app.services.balance_at._fold.fold_loan_balances`) against
the sum of the POSTED legs
(:func:`tests._test_helpers.posted_loan_balance_at`) on
**EVERY DAY** of each generated loan shape's domain -- the shape matrix step C3
must not move money across (plan Section 7.4).

**The counterparty is the test suite's own window, since plan step E1e.**  The
production sum-of-postings readers were deleted there: the seam had folded away
every one of their ``app/`` callers, and grading the postings is the job this
file exists for, so the window belongs on this side of the line.  It reads the
same legs by the same rule (``-(sum where entry_date <= as_of)``, ``None`` with
no opening) -- what changed is that nothing can now render it on a screen.

**What this proves, and what it does not.**  The fold reads the loan's SOURCE
events; the window sums the POSTED legs the sync wrote.  The two SHARE the walk
by design (the postings are a projection of the fold -- plan Section 3), so an
equality on every day is the EQUIVALENCE proof C3's cutover rests on -- the
posted cache faithfully projects the fold -- and NOT an independent proof of the
split's VALUE.  The split's value is pinned elsewhere and stays there: the
Step-4 reconciliation oracle's parallel run against the un-seeded resolver
(``test_posting_ledger_loan_reconciliation.py``), A2's hand-computed Taxes
oracle, and B1's hand-computed fold figures (``test_loan_ledger.py``).  Do not
read this file's equalities as the correctness proof; they are the equivalence
proof.

**Sampling is forbidden.**  A 14-day sample once scored perfect while wrong by
$178,103.41 on 22% of days (plan Section 7.2), so every test walks EVERY day of
its domain, never a sample, and guards its loop so a vacuous domain cannot pass.

**N-11 (a raw transaction typed onto a loan) is closed by construction**, not
carried as an exception: the user paths that could create one -- the
transaction-create routes, the recurrence-template form, AND the salary-profile
account picker -- each refuse or exclude an amortizing account (ruling D4;
``_reject_transaction_on_loan``, the ``_validate_template_form`` gate, and the
salary picker's ``has_amortization`` filter), so no such row can enter the fold's
domain.  Were one forced in (a legacy row), the
fold would not see it while the reader would, diverging by its amount; the guard
is what keeps the every-day equality below complete.  See
:class:`TestRawLoanTransactionIsTheOnlyDivergence` and
``tests/test_routes/test_transaction_guards.py``.

"""Tests for ``app.services.loan_resolver`` (Commit 13 / E-18).

These tests pin the resolver's behavior with hand-computed Decimal
expectations.  The resolver is a pure function, so every test
constructs a duck-typed loan-params object and a list of
anchor-event-shaped objects directly -- no database fixtures are
needed.  This keeps the tests fast (the full file runs in well
under a second) and isolates the resolver's logic from the rest of
the system.

Test IDs map to the Commit 13 plan in
``docs/audits/financial_calculations/remediation_plan.md`` section 9.
Every monetary expectation carries the arithmetic in a comment so a
future reader can verify the assertion by hand.

# replay of confirmed history and projection of the future are split

# every Payoff Calculator surface reads through.  Chart series and
# summary metrics derive from one return value, so they cannot
# diverge.

# reproduction has a multi-month temporal gap between origination
# (2024-01-01) and the first confirmed payment (2026-01-01); this is
# the input shape that surfaces the "extra applied to ghost
# historical months" defect that
# ``tests/test_services/test_amortization_engine.py::TestPaymentAwareSchedule``
# could never catch (it set ORIGINATION = first confirmed payment's
# month, eliminating the gap).  Every test in this class deliberately
# preserves a gap unless the test name says otherwise.

class TestTheReplayProjectionCutIsTheSettledDay:
    """Plan step **X-an** / finding **N-187**: one cut, on the day cash moved.

    The resolver's replay takes what has happened on ONE predicate --
    ``_replay_from_anchor`` reads ``has_settled_by`` -- and what has not is the
    balance seam's plan's (since plan step R7d-g-3, ruling **R-R88**; until
    then the composer's own ``_build_monthly_override`` planned it, and both
    halves of this class were the composer's).  (A settled payment CAN be in
    neither the replay nor the plan;
    ``test_a_payment_an_anchor_subsumes_is_in_neither_half`` below is the
    counter-example, and "exact complements" is what this deliberately is
    not.)  Until X-an both sides asked whether the payment's PAY PERIOD had
    begun, while the posted ledger that seeds the projection counted the same
    payment from the day its cash moved (``loan_ledger.payment_visible_on``).
    The two dates differ in both directions, and both failures move a figure the
    developer reads:

    * settled EARLY (before the paycheck period funding it opens): the ledger
      had already paid the installment down and the resolver planned it again,
      so the forward chart paid it twice;
    * settled AFTER an evaluation date its period already covers (an ordinary
      state for a read of a PAST date): history to the resolver, not to the
      ledger, so it fell out of both the balance and the plan.

    Measured on a $300,000 / 6% / 360-month loan whose 2026-08-01 installment is
    funded by the pay period opening 2026-07-31 and whose cash left 2026-07-30:
    read on 2026-07-30 the projected balance was $310.81 low the following
    month, growing to $1,789.69 at the tail of the schedule.

    **The end-to-end test does not grade the cut on its own, and the
    partition test is not redundant with it.**  A replay a day off the
    predicate still opens its forward slice in September on this fixture, so
    the end-to-end test stays green;
    ``test_the_replay_takes_exactly_the_settled_by_set`` is what fails there,
    and it does so by reading the predicate directly.

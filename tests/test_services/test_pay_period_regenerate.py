"""Tests for pay-period CRUD slice (e): regenerate (rebuild the future tail).

Regenerate = truncate the not-yet-started, unlocked tail, then generate a
fresh schedule from a corrected start/cadence.  It composes truncate (so it
inherits the hard-lock and discard gates) with generate + a cadence upsert.

**It does NOT repopulate; the ROUTE does, and that is ruling R-R38** (plan
step R7d-c-1).  The door records the rebuilt tail EMPTY and returns, because
the read pass the recurrence resolves in may only be opened above the service
layer and only after the periods exist.  A case here that asserts recurring
ROWS therefore runs ``_regenerate_and_populate``, which is what the route
runs; a case about the door's own contract calls the door alone.  ``POST
/pay-periods/regenerate`` is graded in
``tests/test_routes/test_pay_period_admin.py``.

``today`` is pinned with ``freeze_today`` so the past / current / future
split is deterministic regardless of when the suite runs.  All four
disciplines apply: structural invariants (Discipline 1), hand-computed
as-of balances across the retained and rebuilt windows (Discipline 2),
the production integrity checker (Discipline 3), and adversarial refusal
tests (Discipline 4).  See
``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_period_crud.md``.

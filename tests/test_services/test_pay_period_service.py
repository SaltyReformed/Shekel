Shekel Budget App -- Pay Period Service Tests

Integration tests for the pay-period READERS.  All of them issue DB queries,
so these run against a real PostgreSQL database using the shared
app/db/bare_user fixtures from conftest.

**The writer's tests moved out at plan step C3-b**, with the writer, to
``test_pay_period_write.py``.  What is left here answers "which periods does
this owner have", which plan step C2-f points at ``pay_calendar.PayCalendar``.

**Three readers' tests moved out at C2-f1, WITH the behaviour they grade** --
none was deleted, because none of the behaviour was:

* ``get_next_period`` -> ``test_pay_calendar_value.TestPeriodStartingAfter``,
  beside the ``period_starting_before`` mirror that also replaced
  ``companion_service.get_previous_period``.
* ``get_current_and_future_periods`` ->
  ``tests/test_routes/test_period_options.py``, because the rule it encoded is
  the FORM's ("an already-closed period is not somewhere a row moves TO")
  rather than the calendar's.
* ``get_overlapping_periods`` -> nothing moved, because **it had no direct
  test call site at all**: the retired SQL was exercised only through
  ``calendar_service`` and ``spending_report_service``, never graded on its own.
  ``test_pay_calendar_value``'s ``overlapping`` tests grade the predicate that
  replaced it, and grade it harder -- they cover the crossed range, which the
  query answered with an empty list and the calendar refuses.

**A FOURTH reader's tests moved out at C2-f2b**, and it is the first of the
six to be DELETED rather than re-pointed: ``get_periods_in_range`` had all
three of its ``app/`` call sites in the grid route (``page.py`` twice,
``partials.py`` once), so moving the grid onto ``PayCalendar.window`` left it
with no caller.  Its four cases went to
``test_pay_calendar_value.TestAWindowIsAViewAndKeepsTheRealEnds``, which
already graded three of them (the exact window, the partial one past the end,
and the empty one) on the method that now answers.  The fourth -- a NEGATIVE
``first_index``, which the SQL expressed as ``period_index >= -1`` and which
comes back one period SHORT rather than re-based -- had no equivalent there
and is now its own test in that class, named as inherited coverage.  Reachable
from ``/grid?offset=-99`` on every schedule.

    **These graded ``pay_period_service.get_current_period`` until plan step
    C2-f3a DELETED it**, and they are re-pointed rather than removed, because
    none of the behaviour was removed -- the same discipline the three C2-f1
    readers got (module docstring).  What answers now is
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.period_containing`, reached
    through the one database door, so these remain an INTEGRATION grade of the
    loader plus the derivation plus the search against real rows, where
    ``test_pay_calendar_value`` grades the search alone with no database.

    Two things the retired reader did that these cases now pin the ABSENCE of:
    its ``.first()`` carried no ``ORDER BY`` (ledger row **P19**), and its day
    defaulted to the process clock rather than being asked for (row **P49**).
    Every case here states its own day as a literal, which is the clock
    discipline ``.claude/rules/testing.md`` asks for and which the old
    signature made optional.

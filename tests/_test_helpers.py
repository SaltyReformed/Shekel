def freeze_today(monkeypatch, target_date, modules=None, at_time=None):

    Production services import ``date`` (and sometimes ``datetime``) at
    module load time (e.g. ``from datetime import date``), so
    monkeypatching ``datetime.date`` globally does not affect them.
    Each module that uses ``date.today()`` or ``datetime.now()`` must
    be patched individually.  This helper hides that boilerplate.

    Patches BOTH ``date`` and ``datetime`` so that test helpers using
    ``datetime.now() - timedelta(days=N)`` align with production code
    using ``date.today()``.  ``datetime.now()`` returns NOON of
    ``target_date`` (timezone-aware when ``tz`` is passed).

    **Noon, not midnight, and the DATABASE half of this freeze has always
    said so.**  :func:`_freeze_db_clock` pins PostgreSQL's clock with
    :func:`settle_instant_on` -- noon UTC -- precisely "so the frozen date the
    test reads from ``date.today()`` and the date the app RENDERS for these
    rows are the same date".  This half used MIDNIGHT UTC, which is the
    previous EVENING in ``America/New_York``: under ruling R-DH (b) every
    display-timezone reader (``app.utils.dates.display_today``, the analytics
    tax year, the loan YTD chips, and since plan step 2 the day an anchor
    assertion is filed under) then answered ``target_date - 1``.  Two halves of
    one freeze, twelve hours and one civil date apart, with the rule stated
    correctly in one of them.  It is finding N-132's shape a sixth time --
    midnight UTC used to MEAN a civil day -- and it is fixed here rather than
    worked around at each reader.

    **Both halves now take the SAME instant, ``at_time`` included** (plan step
    X-f1b).  The database half derived its own noon from ``target_date`` until
    then, so a caller that named an EVENING instant -- the only kind that can
    tell a display-timezone rule apart from a UTC one, which is what finding
    **N-182** needed -- re-opened the same split the paragraph above closed, in
    the direction nothing had exercised.  Nothing moves at the default: noon UTC
    on ``target_date`` is exactly what the database half computed for itself.

    Args:
        monkeypatch:
            pytest's ``monkeypatch`` fixture.  Required so the patch is
            torn down at end of test automatically.
        target_date:
            The ``datetime.date`` instance that ``date.today()`` should
            return inside the patched modules.
        modules:
            Iterable of dotted module paths whose ``date`` and
            ``datetime`` symbols to replace.  When omitted, every
            loaded module that has a top-level ``date`` or ``datetime``
            symbol bound to the real class is patched -- this covers
            production services (``app.services.*``), test modules
            that imported ``date`` inline, and ``tests.conftest``
            itself, ensuring all layers see the same frozen "today".
            Pass an explicit tuple to patch only specific modules.
        at_time:
            Optional wall time on ``target_date`` for the frozen ``now``,
            overriding the noon default.  For a test that means a specific
            INSTANT rather than a day -- the New Year boundary cases, where
            ``time.min`` (midnight UTC) is deliberately the previous EVENING in
            the display timezone.  Saying it beats relying on the default: the
            boundary tests read midnight out of this helper as an undocumented
            implementation detail, and one of their own siblings already hand-
            rolled a stub because the helper offered no way to ask.

    * a BULK update (``carry_forward_service``'s ``query.update(...)``) renders
      the same thing while bypassing the ORM unit of work entirely, so no

    All three render the call into the SQL, so rewriting the SQL is the ONE
    place that answers all three.  An earlier draft stamped the first two on
    the mapped objects instead and left the third: the full suite reported 41
    failures, every one of them a bulk UPDATE, which is how the third was found

    Every occurrence in one statement takes the same instant, so a row's
    ``created_at`` and ``updated_at`` do not disagree by a microsecond.

    database answers it in several places: 61 columns take their INSERT value
    from a ``NOW()`` server default, one from a ``CURRENT_DATE`` text default,
    and 23 of them re-stamp on UPDATE.  So a fixture that settled a row "now"
    stamped it months outside the pay periods the test seeded, and the balance
    fold -- which dates every event -- replayed it outside the window entirely.
    Nothing noticed while the shipping producers read the LATEST anchor row and
    ignored its date; the fold made the instant load-bearing.

    **One of the FOUR reaches this was written for is gone, closed
    structurally rather than contained** (plan step X-f1, ruling R-EC).
    ``status_seam`` assigned ``db.func.now()`` to ``Transaction.settled_on``
    outright -- the one reach that was not a schema derivation, so nothing but
    this rewriter could see it.  The seam stamps ``display_today()`` into a
    ``DATE`` column now, which is a Python value the ``date.today()`` freeze
    already governs.  The rewriter stays for the other reaches, which are
    schema-level and not going anywhere.

    Two mechanisms cover it, and each covers what the other structurally
    cannot: :func:`_stamp_omitted_db_defaults` for a default that never appears
    in any SQL, and :func:`_rewrite_db_clock_calls` for every call that does --
    including the bulk updates no session listener can see.  The rewriter is
    bound eagerly by the ``setup_database`` fixture
    (:func:`bind_db_clock_rewriter`), never lazily, so neither mechanism
    depends on the other having run.

    The instant is the one :func:`freeze_today` froze ``datetime.now()`` to, so
    the two halves cannot disagree about WHEN "now" is.  By default that is noon
    UTC -- :func:`settle_instant_on`'s value, this suite's existing primitive for
    "a deterministic instant on this civil day", the same civil day in the
    display timezone, so the frozen date the test reads from ``date.today()`` and
    the date the app RENDERS for these rows are the same date.  A caller that
    names an instant with ``at_time`` gets THAT instant here too: an
    evening-Eastern freeze (the only kind that can tell a display-timezone rule
    apart from a UTC one) would otherwise leave the database eleven hours and one
    civil date away from the app, which is the split this docstring's sibling
    paragraph in :func:`freeze_today` was written about.

    Production is unchanged, and deliberately so.  The database is the right
    authority for a production timestamp -- two app workers with skewed clocks
    would stamp inconsistent instants -- so the fix belongs in the harness, not
    in the models.

    Stated boundary: a timestamp written by a database TRIGGER (the
    ``system.audit_log`` rows) still comes from the real clock, because the
    trigger's own clock call is never rendered into a statement this sees.  No
    balance producer reads those rows, and freezing them would take a
    ``search_path`` override that fails OPEN the moment anything resets the
    path.

    The shared write-through step of the three loan fixtures below
    (:func:`create_loan_account`, :func:`insert_trueup_event`,
    :func:`insert_tracking_start_event`).  Every production path that creates or
    re-bases a loan's anchors reconciles the genesis postings in the SAME
    transaction as the source row:

    * ``loan.create_params`` / ``loan.update_params`` call
      :func:`~app.services.loan_posting_service.sync_loan_postings_all_scenarios`
      (``app/routes/loan/params.py:125`` and ``:177``).
    * The balance true-up and the tracking-start opening both route through
      :func:`app.services.anchor_service._append_loan_anchor_and_sync`, which
      appends the event, re-syncs, and commits (``anchor_service.py:390``).

    The property that matters, and the one this helper reproduces, is that the
    event and its postings land in the SAME transaction -- never an event alone.
    This helper flushes rather than commits, keeping the existing fixture contract
    (the caller owns the transaction and commits with the rest of its setup).

    Without this, a fixture-built loan carries anchor rows but NO opening
    posting -- a state production cannot produce, and the one every loan built
    through these helpers used to be in (so it exercised the no-ledger fallback
    while production always took the ledger path).

    **Scope, stated plainly so nobody over-trusts it.**  This reaches only loans
    built through :func:`create_loan_account` / :func:`create_loan_with_trueup` /
    :func:`insert_trueup_event` / :func:`insert_tracking_start_event`.  Roughly
    twenty test modules still hand-roll a loan (a bare ``LoanParams(...)`` insert;
    e.g. ``tests/test_services/test_balance_at.py::_make_mortgage``, a near-copy of
    :func:`create_loan_account`).  Such a loan gets a ledger only if one of the
    anchor helpers above happens to be called on it afterwards, and otherwise has
    none at all -- ``test_year_end_summary_service.py``'s hand-built loan is in
    exactly that state.  That coupling is invisible at the call site and is a real
    trap; routing the hand-rolled builders through this factory is a follow-up
    (and a prerequisite for the fail-loud read seam, which turns a ledger-less loan
    into a raise).

    Deliberately calls the PLAIN sync rather than production's
    :func:`~app.services.loan_posting_service.sync_all_scenarios_or_duplicate`:
    the duplicate-translating wrapper exists to turn a user's double-click into
    idempotent success, and it does so by ROLLING BACK.  In a fixture that would
    silently discard the test's setup; a duplicate anchor written by a fixture is
    a bug in the fixture and must fail loud.

    Flushes but does NOT commit -- the caller owns the transaction boundary, the
    same contract the production chokepoints keep.

    **No future-anchor guard, because there is nothing left to guard.**  This
    helper used to assert that no user-asserted anchor was dated after the sync's
    as-of, because the walk DROPPED such an anchor and left the loan half-opened
    (opening present, true-up missing) -- a state that looked ledger-backed and
    was not.  The walk no longer reads a clock: it records every anchor the loan
    carries, whatever its date, and the readers decide what has happened
    (``loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger``).  So a fixture's anchor
    posts whatever its date, and a fixture can no longer build the half-opened
    loan by accident.

    """Create a loan account with LoanParams, origination event, and rate.

    The ONE shared loan-account builder for every DB-backed loan in the suite.
    Routes the account through the canonical ``account_service.create_account``
    factory (so it gets its origination ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row), inserts a
    ``LoanParams`` row, seeds the origination ``RateHistory`` the loan resolver
    requires, and OPENS the genesis posting ledger -- so a caller never has to
    repeat that dance, and cannot accidentally omit a step.

    Seventeen suites used to hand-roll this block (a ``LoanParams(...)`` insert
    beside a copy of the account-factory call).  Every one of them omitted the
    ledger open, so their loans silently exercised the no-ledger FALLBACK that
    production never takes -- which is exactly how a $3,455.79 divergence between
    the two balance producers stayed invisible to the whole suite.  They differed
    from this factory in only two respects, which are the two knobs below:
    the account TYPE and the anchor PERIOD.  Everything else was duplication.

    **Always OPENS the loan's genesis ledger** (:func:`_sync_loan_ledger`), which
    is what ``loan.create_params`` does in the same transaction as the
    ``LoanParams`` insert (``app/routes/loan/params.py:125``).  There is no
    opt-out: a configured loan without an opening posting is a state production
    cannot produce, and a suite built on it exercises the no-ledger fallback that
    production never takes.  A test that needs that broken loan on purpose builds
    it explicitly with :func:`clear_loan_ledger`.

    The sync runs after the ``RateHistory`` insert because the genesis walk
    resolves the loan's rate periods, and the resolver raises on an empty
    rate-change feed.

    Commits before returning so the loan is fully resolvable.

    Args:
        seed_user: The ``seed_user`` fixture dict.
        db_session: The test ``db.session``.
        name: The account name.
        principal: The original principal (and the account anchor); both
            ``original_principal`` and ``current_principal`` are seeded
            to it.  Defaults to ``Decimal("1000.00")``.
        rate: The origination annual rate as a Decimal fraction.  Defaults
            to ``Decimal("0.05000")`` (5%).
        term: The loan term in months (default 24).
        origination_date: The loan origination date (default
            ``date(2026, 1, 1)``).
        payment_day: The day-of-month payment day (default 1).
        account_type: The :class:`~app.enums.AcctTypeEnum` member to create the
            account as; defaults to ``AUTO_LOAN``.  Keyword-only.  Resolved to its
            id through :mod:`app.ref_cache` -- the project's ref-table rule is IDs
            for logic, name strings for display only, so this takes the enum and
            never a name string.  Any amortizing type works (``MORTGAGE`` is the
            other one the suite uses).
        (It took an ``anchor_period`` until plan step X-f1c3c.  **It was LIVE,
        not vestigial** -- it reached ``AccountSpec.anchor_period_id``, which
        ``account_service.create_account`` wrote to BOTH
        ``accounts.current_anchor_period_id`` and the origination assertion's
        own ``pay_period_id``.  Rulings R-EH and R-EO deleted both
        destinations, so the parameter had nowhere left to reach.  A loan's
        balance is ledger-derived from dated ``LoanAnchorEvent`` rows
        regardless, which is why no caller loses an assertion by dropping it.
        *A first version of this note said the parameter had "zero loads in its
        body", which was measured AFTER its use had already been deleted in the
        same pass -- a measurement of a state the author had just created, and
        the reason a claims audit caught it.*)
        anchor_balance: The ACCOUNT's anchor balance, when it must differ from the
            loan's ``principal``; defaults to *principal*.  Keyword-only.  These
            are genuinely two different facts, and production can set them apart:
            the account is created first (with a user-entered anchor) and the loan
            params are configured afterwards, through a separate route.  A test
            that needs to prove the loan path is driving a balance -- rather than
            the generic account-anchor path -- makes them differ, so the anchor is
            a distinguishable decoy rather than the same number twice.

    Returns:
        The created loan :class:`~app.models.account.Account`.  Its
        :class:`LoanParams` row is reachable via :func:`loan_params_for` when a
        caller needs to append an anchor event to it.

    The shared "build an account of type X" helper for the ledger-account
    (Build-Order Step 2) suites, so the stereotyped ``AccountType`` lookup +
    ``AccountSpec`` + ``create_account`` block is not copied per file (a
    duplicate-code finding).  ``create_account`` fires the Step-2
    ledger-account sync hook, so the returned account already carries its
    paired ``budget.ledger_accounts`` row.  The opening anchor balance
    defaults to a fixed sentinel (the ledger-pairing suites assert on
    pairing, never on balance); the Step-5 account-anchor suites pass an
    explicit ``anchor_balance`` because the opening correction posts exactly
    that value.  The anchor period is resolved by the factory from the day the
    opening is observed on.

    **What it returns is an account that has ALREADY EXISTED**, and both halves
    of that are deliberate.

    * The origination ASSERTION defaults to the day BEFORE today (ruling
      R-DH (a), finding N-133 / F1).  An assertion is the CLOSING balance for
      its civil day, so a settle dated that same day is INSIDE it -- and the
      ordinary settle idiom in these suites is the seam's own ``settled_on =
      display_today()``, which under a frozen clock is TODAY.  An account
      asserted "today" therefore swallows every settle the test then records,
      and the fixture stops exercising the thing it names.
    * The BOOKS are then opened before anything this fixture could date, always
      (plan step X-f3c-2b, ruling **R-HG**).  An opening equity is the closing
      balance for its OWN day, so a movement dated on or before it is not
      absorbed but REFUSED.  ``observed_on`` does not switch this off: it says
      where the assertion goes, which is a different question.

    **A suite whose subject is the record ``create_account`` writes wants
    :func:`create_account_via_service` instead** -- this one appends a second

    Two deliberate differences from the deleted reader, both stated so a caller is
    not surprised:

    * it answers ANY date, where the reader raised for ``as_of > today``.  That
      raise was a DOMAIN guard forcing production callers to route a future date
      to the projection; there are no such callers now.  A future date sums the
      same postings (every posted entry is dated today or earlier), so it carries
      the confirmed balance FLAT -- which is exactly what the deleted per-period
      reader did, and what the early-settle parallel run reads at period ends
      beyond today.
    * the per-period form (:func:`posted_loan_balance_map`) is a plain
      per-period call, not a prefix-sum over one grouped load.  The batching
      existed for production read cost; an oracle wants the simplest derivation

    C2), so a payment settled during period P must count in P's balance, which

    **For a test whose subject is an EARLIER revision's shipped SQL**, which is
    the only reason this exists.  Plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-c`` dropped
    ``end_date`` and ``period_index``; several migrations older than it read
    those columns, and a test that drives one of their callables against the
    test database therefore meets ``UndefinedColumn`` where it used to find the
    schema it expected.

    It runs that revision's own ``downgrade()`` rather than issuing DDL of its
    own, so the columns come back with the constraints, the NOT NULLs and --
    for every row already in the table -- the VALUES the shipped statement
    rebuilds.  A hand-written ``ADD COLUMN`` here would be a second statement of
    the schema that could drift from the migration without failing anything.

    **What it does NOT do, stated because the difference is the whole risk.**
    It does not put the database at any particular revision: everything else
    stays at head, so this is head's schema plus two restored columns.  That is
    enough for a test whose subject is a STATEMENT reading those two columns,
    and it is not enough for one whose subject is the whole schema at its own
    revision -- for that, every revision after it has to be undone in order,
    which is what Alembic does and what no helper here pretends to.  *The
    general shape -- migration tests in this suite drive their callables at
    HEAD rather than at the revision's own parent -- is a latent category error
    that C4-c is simply the first step to make fire; it is recorded as ledger
    row ``balance:P79`` rather than fixed inside this step.*

    No restore is needed afterwards: the ``db`` fixture drops and re-clones the
    per-worker database for every test, so a schema this leaves off head cannot
    reach the next one.

    **Call it on the session whose transaction is the one holding locks**, and
    in practice that means BEFORE entering a nested ``app.app_context()`` rather
    than inside one.  ``ADD COLUMN`` takes ACCESS EXCLUSIVE; Flask-SQLAlchemy
    scopes its session to the app context and a test already runs inside one,
    so a NESTED context gets a second session on a second connection while the
    outer one sits idle-in-transaction holding ACCESS SHARE on
    ``budget.pay_periods`` from whatever its fixtures last read.  The two
    conflict and the DDL dies on the cluster's 10-second ``lock_timeout`` --
    measured rather than predicted, and a confusing failure to meet cold.  The
    commit below ends the handed-in session's own transaction, which is every
    conflict this function can reach; a session in another scope is not
    addressable from here.

    :func:`restore_pay_period_derived_columns`' MIRROR, and the mirror is the
    point.  That helper exists because a later revision REMOVED columns an
    older statement reads; this one exists because plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C14-b`` ADDED a ``NOT NULL`` column an older statement does
    not write.  Both break the same assumption -- that head's schema is a
    superset an old statement can still run against -- and it holds for READS
    and not for an insert into a table that has since gained a required
    column.

    Concretely: ``af8254074bef``'s backfill is
    ``INSERT INTO budget.pay_schedule (user_id, cadence_days) SELECT ...``, and
    at head PostgreSQL refuses that row with a ``NotNullViolation`` naming a
    column the statement predates by 95 revisions.

    **It drops the NOT NULL rather than running C14-b's ``downgrade()``, and
    the difference was measured rather than reasoned.**  The downgrade removes
    the COLUMN, and every reader in the test then breaks instead: the mapper at
    head still selects ``shift_id``, so the assertions that read the backfilled
    row back through the ORM die on ``UndefinedColumn``.  What the old
    statement needs is not the column's absence but permission to omit it, and
    that is the smaller change -- it leaves the column, the foreign key and
    every ORM reader intact.  Hand-written DDL here therefore duplicates no
    migration statement: it relaxes one constraint for the length of a test
    rather than restating a schema change.

    Everything :func:`restore_pay_period_derived_columns` says about scope
    applies unchanged -- the database is left at head minus one constraint

    Flushes via the service; the caller commits.

    Args:
        seed_user: The ``seed_user`` fixture dict (supplies ``user_id`` and
            the baseline scenario).
        db_session: The test ``db.session`` (unused directly -- the service
            owns the session -- but accepted so call sites read uniformly).
        from_account: The :class:`~app.models.account.Account` money leaves
            (the expense shadow lands here).
        to_account: The account money enters (the income shadow lands here).
        period: The :class:`~app.models.pay_period.PayPeriod` to place the
            transfer (and both shadows) in.
        amount: The transfer amount (Decimal); also the shadows'
            ``estimated_amount``.  Defaults to ``Decimal("100.00")``.
        actual_amount: When not ``None``, the settled actual amount mirrored
            to both shadows (so their ``effective_amount`` becomes this, not
            ``amount``).  Defaults to ``None`` (effective == estimated ==
            amount).
        settled_on: The civil DAY written to both shadows.  Defaults to the
            user's today (what the seam derives, and the realistic ``mark_done``
            value).  A loan test reading a PAST balance must pin this to the day
            it wants the payment visible from -- balance step C2 keys visibility
            on the SETTLED date -- typically the period's ``start_date``.  It
            took an INSTANT until plan step X-f1 and callers wrapped their day in
            ``settle_instant_on``; the column stores the day now, so the day is
            passed directly.  **Passing ``None`` EXPLICITLY is now REFUSED**, and
            this paragraph promised the opposite until a neutral review caught
            it: the sentinel is ``_UNSET_SETTLED_ON``, not ``None``, so an
            explicit ``None`` reaches ``update_transfer`` and, since finding
            **N-183** routed that write through the status seam, raises
            ``ValidationError`` ("the settle day cannot be cleared") rather than
            NULLing a settled pair.  A fixture that genuinely needs the broken
            settled-with-no-day row builds it with the bare :func:`add_txn`
            instead, which is what that builder is for.
        name: Optional transfer display name.
        due_date: Optional due date stored on the transfer and mirrored to both
            shadows, passed straight through to :func:`create_transfer`.
            ``None`` (the default) leaves it unset, and a loan payment's
            installment then falls back to its pay-period start.  Pass it when a
            test needs two settled loan payments in ONE accrual period at
            DIFFERENT installments -- the period-start fallback resolves both to
            the same date, so it cannot express that shape.
        scenario: The :class:`~app.models.scenario.Scenario` to place the
            transfer (and both shadows) in.  Defaults to ``None``, which uses
            the seed user's baseline scenario (``seed_user["scenario"]``);
            pass a non-baseline scenario to exercise multi-scenario isolation
            (the Commit-6 reconciliation oracle).

    Returns:
        The settled (Paid) parent :class:`~app.models.transfer.Transfer`.

    inside the anchor balance" unconditionally, so a fixture could set it on an
    account whose only assertion PREDATED the purchase -- a state production
    cannot reach, because the way a purchase gets inside a declared balance is
    that the user declared the balance after it posted.  That is finding
    N-132 / R8's shape: a fixture asserting a state the app cannot produce
    passes for years and stops discriminating the case it names.

    So this helper does what the flag did AND states the precondition the flag
    let fixtures skip.  It fails loudly rather than silently building an
    unreachable row, and the failure message names both days.

    **The bound is TWO-SIDED, and the upper half was added after the guard's
    first pass let an unreachable row through anyway.**  Checking only
    ``settled_on <= observed_on`` invites the obvious escape: move the
    ASSERTION forward until it covers the purchase.  But an assertion is itself
    bounded -- ``anchor_service.resolve_observation_day`` refuses an
    ``observed_on`` after the user's today, because a balance you have not read
    yet is not an observation -- so an assertion dated into the app's future is

    different N-132 defect, which is what the S1-c conversion's own review
    measured on two ``test_cash_fold`` fixtures.  Both halves are checked here
    so neither escape is open.

    The clock is :func:`app.utils.dates.display_today` -- the same one the
    service guard reads, and the one a suite's ``freeze_today`` moves -- never

    Returns:
        The updated entry (flushed).

    Raises:
        AssertionError: When the account has never asserted a balance, when its
            latest assertion is for a day BEFORE *settled_on*, or when that

    states WHAT MOVED as well as when.  This answers what such a fixture means
    -- and it answers ARM FOR ARM the way the real verbs do, because a fixture
    producing a record no door can write builds a row the app could never have
    created, and every test over that row grades the wrong branch in silence.

    The three arms, mirroring
    ``transaction_service._settle.settle_transaction`` and
    ``transfer_service._settle.settle``:

      * an ENVELOPE (``settles_from_entries``) records the ``purchases`` basis
        and stores NO figure -- its own entries state it.  Taking the
        ``derived`` arm here stored the PLAN instead, so
        ``row_valuation.settled_figure`` answered a stored column for every
        fixture-built settled envelope where the app answers from its children;
      * a RETAINED ``corrected`` record outlives the settle that made it and a
        re-settle honours it, so it is threaded into
        :meth:`~app.services.status_seam.Settlement.from_settle`;
      * the ECHO rule (finding **N-231**): a *submitted* figure equal to what
        the row would book anyway is not a correction, so it records
        ``derived`` rather than manufacturing a human's figure nobody typed.

    ``None`` for a move that does not ENTER the settled band, which the seam
    requires: a record offered beside a Projected / Credit / Cancelled status is
    refused, and leaving the band releases the ASSERTION while KEEPING the
    record.

    **What the settle BOOKS is the app's own published rule**
    (``transaction_service.settle_amount`` over a basis built the way the verb
    builds one), not the row's ``estimated_amount`` column.  It WAS that column
    until plan step balance:X-au-e, on the stated ground that "such rows own
    their plan, so the two agree" -- true while a generated row stored a figure
    and false the moment one stopped.  A generated row is DERIVED now and its
    column is NULL, so the old spelling handed the seam
    ``Settlement(amount=None, basis=derived)`` and every fixture that settles a
    generated row died on the record's own refusal: *a 'derived' settlement
    must state the figure that moved*.  Reading the rule instead is what makes
    this helper's promise -- that it answers ARM FOR ARM the way the real verbs
    do -- true again rather than true of the rows fixtures happened to build.

    a duplicate-code cluster that mattered once the fold made the row's INSTANT

    UPDATEd a stored :class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory` row to
    move its business day and its recording instant onto a day the test had
    chosen.  ``budget.account_anchor_history`` is append-only, so no such act
    exists: an assertion records what a bank said on a day and the only way to
    say something else is to say it again.  This helper is that -- one more
    assertion, carrying the balance that governs unless the caller names
    another, dated on ``at``'s civil day.

    **Why the state it builds is production's own and not a fixture's.**  An
    owner who reconciles twice files two assertions; production's Checking

    the origination one ``account_service.create_account`` wrote and this one --

    again" looks like, and the balance every producer reads on every day at or

    nothing is dated between them.

    **What it does NOT do is move the books.**  ``budget.account_openings`` is
    the account's own opening record and this writes no row there; a caller
    that needs the books earlier than they stand calls
    :func:`open_books_before_the_first_assertion`, which is backward-only and

    own day.  A fixture that then settles a row on or before the account's own
    creation day is building a state the app refuses, and on the frozen suite
    clock that is the ordinary case: ``create_account``'s default ``observed_on``
    and the settle door's default day are the SAME ``display_today()``.

    **It bounds on every day a row could land on and takes the earliest,
    because "the day before the assertion" was measured too tight.**  Route
    suites routinely settle a row days BEFORE the account was created -- a
    correction to money that moved last week -- so an opening one day back
    still refuses them.  The bounds:

    * the account's earliest ASSERTION, which is where ``create_account`` put
      the books;
    * the owner's earliest PAY PERIOD, which is the floor the settle door itself
      applies (``pay_period_service.earliest_recordable_day``, ruling R-EL), so
      nothing a door accepts can precede it;
    * the earliest day the account ALREADY records money moving, so a helper
      called after the rows exist cannot strand them;
    **A matched BANK LINE bounds the books too and is deliberately NOT a term
    here, because it cannot change the answer** (plan step
    balance:X-f3c-2b-2b).  It was added as one and then removed on a proof
    rather than on taste: this helper only ever moves the books BACKWARD (it
    clamps to the standing opening), and the database constraint already
    guarantees the standing opening sits strictly below every line the account
    has matched.  So ``min(matched) - 1`` is never smaller than the clamp, and
    the term is dead in every state the boundary permits.  A defensive term
    that cannot fire is the *born dead* shape ``lessons.md`` names, and it
    would have read as protection nobody had.
    * *also_before*, when the caller knows a day of its own -- a loan's
      ORIGINATION is the one that exists, because its payment schedule runs
      from there and the owner's calendar may start later.

    One day before the earliest of those is the latest day that leaves every
    recordable day recordable.  It is still a real production shape -- books
    that opened before the budget did is exactly what finding **N-368**'s import
    will create for the developer's own Checking account -- and it moves NO
    figure in a fixture: the origination assertion still clears whatever settled
    on its own day, so every correction is what it was.

    **BACKWARD only, and that is a rule rather than an accident.**  The books
    never move forward here, so calling this twice, or calling it on an account
    some other helper already opened earlier, cannot strand a row that was
    legal a moment ago.  ``tests/conftest``'s own calendar reset learned the
    same rule the same way one table over, and plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C4-b-1`` then measured that its backward-only restatement
    could not move a day in any world that file builds and deleted it; what
    enforces the rule there now is a refusal, not a restatement.

    A no-op for an account carrying no assertion, and equally for one carrying
    no opening ROW -- both production-unreachable, both states a raw-model

    of every financial number in Shekel, and period corruption produces
    a silently wrong balance rather than an error, so this helper exists
    to make that corruption impossible to ship undetected.  See

      2. Every transfer has exactly two shadow transactions, both in the
         transfer's (still-existing) period.
      3. No transaction references a pay period that no longer exists.

    **FOUR invariants were DELETED at plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-c``, and
    none of them was replaced.**  They asserted that ``period_index`` was
    unique per user, that ordinal order matched payday order on BOTH
    ``start_date`` and ``end_date``, that the ordinals were contiguous, and
    that no two periods' spans overlapped -- the same functional dependency
    ``integrity_check`` BA-03 / BA-04 policed in weekly SQL and
    ``recurrence._calendar.PeriodCalendar.__post_init__`` policed at the value

    is now its position in payday order and its end is the day before the next
    payday, so a duplicate ordinal, an ordinal gap, an order disagreement and
    an overlap are not states this database can hold.  ``uq_pay_periods_user_
    start`` is what remains, and it is a KEY rather than an assertion.

    *This helper carried the WRITE DOOR's exact blind spot while it existed*

            the first 1st of a month the schedule reaches for a calendar
            one -- so a fixture that states nothing generates where it
            always did, and a MONTHLY_FIRST rule does not read as firing on
            whichever day of the month the schedule happened to open on.
        fires_on_day: An alternative to *starts_on* for a test that describes
            its subject as a cadence rather than as a date -- "a monthly bill
            on the 15th".  Translated by :func:`first_occurrence_on_day`; see

            Mutually exclusive with *starts_on*.
        fires_in_month: The month half of that description, for the annual and
            semi-annual cadences.
        interval_n: Read only when *cadence* fixes none of its own -- exactly
            ``EVERY_N_PERIODS``; every other constant carries one and this
            argument is discarded.  (The COLUMN takes any positive interval
            for any unit since plan step R7c-c -- what is narrow here is the
            constant, not the model.)

        due_day_of_month: Real bill due day, when it differs from the

    :func:`make_transfer_template`'s loan-shaped sibling, and the difference is
    the ``budget.loan_payment_settings`` row.  ``routes/loan/payment_transfer.py``
    writes one on every loan payment IT creates -- it is what carries the MODE
    (``derive_from_loan``) and the standing overpayment -- so a fixture pointing
    the generic builder at a loan builds a definition the LOAN's own door would
    never leave behind.

    **A settings-less recurring transfer into a loan is still REACHABLE**, and
    an adversarial review of plan step R7d-a corrected an earlier version of
    this paragraph that said otherwise: ``POST /transfers`` offers every active
    account as a destination and attaches no settings row
    (``routes/transfers/templates.py``), and production holds ZERO
    ``loan_payment_settings`` rows, so it is the state the developer's own two
    loans are in.  What is unreachable is that state arising from the loan
    dashboard's create-transfer button, which is the door these fixtures stand
    in for.

    **It went unnoticed while nothing read the definition for an unmaterialised
    installment.**  R7d-a made the forward plan price every installment no row
    covers from the loan's own standing payment, so the generic builder's
    arbitrary base -- ``$200.00``, named "To Savings" -- started meaning "this
    is what the owner pays the mortgage", and six tests whose docstrings state
    the CONTRACTUAL figure began asserting against a loan being paid a fifth of
    it.  The numbers were right; the fixture was not.

    Defaults to DERIVE mode, which is what the loan dashboard's own
    create-transfer button writes: the payment IS the loan's P&I plus escrow
    plus any standing extra, so the *amount* is a snapshot and no test has to
    keep it in step with the loan's terms.  Pass ``derive_from_loan=False`` to
    build the MANUAL payment an owner types a figure for.

    Args:
        db_session: The test ``db.session``.
        seed_user: The ``seed_user`` fixture dict (supplies the owner and the
            checking account the payment leaves from).
        loan_account: The destination loan account.
        amount: The template's stored ``default_amount``.  In derive mode this
            is the snapshot a generated row carries and the live derivation
            supersedes; in manual mode it is the figure the owner stated.
        derive_from_loan: The settings row's mode.
        extra_principal: The settings row's standing monthly overpayment.
        cadence: The :class:`~tests.oracles.recurrence_baseline.ShapeCadence`

# ── Recurrence cadence payloads (plan step R7b-2) ─────────────────
#
# The two AXES a recurrence form authors, in one place.  Before R7b-2 a test
# wrote ``{"recurrence_pattern": str(monthly.id)}`` and every suite carried its
# own spelling of that; the form now states a unit, an interval and a
# placement, and plan step R7c changes the wire shape again when the authored
# columns land.  One producer is one edit then -- and it is also what stops a
# test authoring a cadence the application cannot store, because it states the
# axes and lets the encoder choose the pattern, exactly as the form does.
#
# TWO shapes, because the cadence crosses two boundaries and looks different at
# each.  A BROWSER posts ``ref`` ids spelled as strings; the Marshmallow field
# (``_helpers.RecurrenceUnitField`` / ``PeriodPlacementField``) deserializes
# each to its enum MEMBER, and that is what the route helpers in
# ``app.routes._recurrence_form_helpers`` receive.  A test that drives a route
# through the client wants the first; one that calls a helper directly wants
# the second, and handing it strings would test a payload no schema produces.
# :func:`cadence_payload` is built from :func:`validated_cadence` so the key
# names and the defaults are stated once for both.

    **``starts_on`` rides WITH the cadence since plan step R7c-b**, and it is

    """Return the :class:`PayrollBasis` for *profile* over *periods*.

    **The ONE test-side door onto the paycheck engine's owner input**, added at
    plan step **R-F16** when ``salary.salary_profiles.pay_periods_per_year``
    was dropped and the count became a derivation off
    ``budget.pay_schedule.cadence_days``.  One shared helper rather than a
    ``for_test`` constructor on the production type or a defaulted ``cadence=``
    argument on the engine, which is the ruling ledger row **P54** set for the
    same question about ``BalanceContext``: a production API with only test
    callers is the speculative shape ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 13 forbids, and a
    defaulted cadence would let the engine assume biweekly for an owner who is
    not.

    The default matches the suite's fixtures and
    ``BaseConfig.DEFAULT_PAY_CADENCE_DAYS``, so a test that does not care about
    the rhythm says nothing and gets 26 paychecks a year.  A test that DOES
    care states its cadence and gets the count that follows -- 7 gives 52, 15
    gives 24, 365 gives 1.

    **It takes the owner's PERIODS since plan step balance:X-bh-1**, because
    the basis now carries the whole
    :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar` rather than a bare cadence:
    the engine's four calendar judgements -- third-paycheck detection, the
    first-paycheck-of-month deduction cadence, the FICA wage-base cumulative
    and a deduction's annual cap -- count paydays off it, where they used to
    read an ``all_periods`` argument a caller supplied beside the basis.  A
    case passes here exactly what it used to pass there.

    **It is REQUIRED and has no default, which an adversarial review of this
    step is why.**  A defaulted empty *periods* builds a paydayless calendar
    that still answers the paycheck COUNT from *cadence_days*, so a case
    reading only a gross goes on passing -- while every month and year count
    over it is ZERO, which INVERTS two arms: a 12-per-year deduction stops
    applying where the old empty ``all_periods`` list made it apply
    vacuously, and a 24-per-year one starts applying on a third paycheck.
    Five oracles were measured still taking the default, agreeing with their
    producers only because no fixture behind them carries a deduction or
    reaches the wage base.  An argument a caller can silently omit is the
    same defect this step removed from the engine, one layer up.

    Args:
        profile: The ``SalaryProfile`` (or a duck-typed stand-in) to price.
        periods: The owner's WHOLE schedule as
            :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` values, in any
            order.  Only their paydays are read; the calendar re-derives every
            end and ordinal, so a case may hand over the same values it prices.
        cadence_days: Days between the owner's paydays, 1..365.
        history_opens_on: How far back this owner's paychecks reach, or
            ``None`` -- **the DEFAULT, and it is the column's own** (plan step
            **balance:X-bh-2**).  ``budget.pay_schedule.history_opens_on`` is
            nullable and null means NOT STATED since ruling
            **balance:R-IA**'s 2026-08-31 amendment, so a case that says
            nothing here gets what an owner nobody asked gets: the engine
            counts *periods* and projects nothing below them.  **That makes
            the default the SAFE one** -- forgetting it cannot silently invent
            paychecks, which is the direction a defaulted argument should fail
            in.  A case about the BACKWARD rhythm states a day here, and a
            case about an owner who genuinely started at the record's opening

    # first payday earlier than one cadence after the latest -- and where that
    # let something through, a backward-only restatement moved the books to
    # meet it.  The reset door retires every surviving payday in the SAME call
    # that records the new batch, so that refusal returns early on an empty
    # surviving set and every opening day became legal.

    # A pay period opening at or before an account's books contradicts ruling
    # ``balance:R-HG`` -- an opening equity is the CLOSING balance for its own

    # whichever balance case notices.  **On this door rather than on one of its
    # callers**: a second adversarial review found the first placement was on
    # ``conftest._reset_seed_calendar``, which is one of three callers, and the
    # one a new case is least likely to use --
    # ``rebuild_calendar_from_spans`` reaches this directly and already types
    # arbitrary years.
    #
    # **Per account it is the GOVERNING row, not the latest DAY**, and the
    # difference is not academic: ``budget.account_openings`` is append-only
    # and the governing row is the one recorded LAST (ruling ``balance:R-HE``),
    # so an account restated BACKWARD carries a row with a later ``opened_on``
    # that no longer governs.  The seeded Checking is exactly that -- 2024-01-05
    # from the factory, then 2024-01-04 from
    # ``open_books_before_the_first_assertion`` -- and a first cut of this
    # guard reduced with ``max(opened_on)``, read 2024-01-05, and refused the
    # legal opening day.  ``test_it_admits_the_first_day_it_legally_can``, the

    The measurement a statement count cannot make: an eager load rides inside
    another query as a JOIN and issues no statement of its own, and a
    ``db.session.get`` served from the identity map issues none either.  Both
    hydrate an entity, which is what this counts.

    **The event and not the identity map**, because the map holds WEAK
    references: a probe that counted survivors after the call read zero for a
    producer that had hydrated twelve, since nothing outside the producer
    holds a ``Transaction`` to keep its ``pay_period`` back-reference alive.
    That was measured -- a first cut of this helper read the map and could not
    fire.  ``loaded_as_persistent`` fires per load and cannot be collected
    away.

    **A caller must EXPUNGE first, and this is the one thing about the probe
    that is not obvious.**  ``loaded_as_persistent`` fires on a LOAD, so an
    instance already in the session's identity map is returned by
    ``db.session.get`` without firing anything: a fixture that hands back live
    ORM rows makes this read ZERO for a producer that is hydrating on every
    call, and the guard then passes on exactly the code it exists to refuse.
    Measured at plan step C2-f3e -- with ten periods preloaded, a
    ``db.session.get(PayPeriod, ...)`` inside this block records nothing.  An
    earlier wording of this paragraph claimed the probe counts such a call and
    it does not.

    Shared here rather than per-suite because two SUITES now assert the same
    structural property -- no ORM ``PayPeriod`` on this path.  Written for plan
    step C2-f3d (``test_spending_report_service``), moved here whole by plan
    step C2-f3e (``test_transaction_auth``); both are pay-calendar steps, and
    an earlier wording of this sentence said "two arcs".

    A scenario belongs to exactly one owner (``budget.scenarios.user_id``), so

    derivation, and neither may answer to the other's name.

    Ruling **P54** is why this is a shared helper here rather than a
    convenience on the production constructor: a production API with only test
    callers is the speculative shape ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 13 forbids.
    **Production has the same asymmetry and it is filed, not fixed here**

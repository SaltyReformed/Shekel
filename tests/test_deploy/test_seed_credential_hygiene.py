"""Deployment-layer assertions for Commit C-34.

Covers audit findings F-022 (SEED_USER_PASSWORD persists in container
env), F-053 (REGISTRATION_ENABLED=true default), F-054 (stale
container retire helper exists), and F-113 (.dockerignore excludes
dev-only files).  These tests are intentionally
filesystem-and-text-based: they assert on the on-disk shape of the
deployment artefacts that the Phase 6 audit reviewers will inspect,
rather than booting a container to observe runtime behaviour.

The runtime-behaviour assertions for the Python side of F-022 (env
scrubbing in seed_user.py) live in
tests/test_scripts/test_seed_user.py::TestSeedUserCredentialScrub.
The runtime-behaviour assertions for the route-level F-053 fix
(REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false returns 404) live in
tests/test_routes/test_auth.py::TestRegistrationToggle (existing).

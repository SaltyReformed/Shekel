"""Tests for remediation Commit C-35: Docker container hardening bundle.

Covers audit findings:

    F-055  no-new-privileges not set at daemon or per-container level
    F-056  No capability dropping on any container
    F-057  Dev databases bound to 0.0.0.0 with public credentials
    F-115  No resource limits on any container
    F-116  No Docker log rotation configured
    F-117  Container root filesystem is writable

The artifacts under audit are YAML compose files plus the bundled
Nginx config that pairs with the read-only nginx service.  Tests
parse the YAML rather than substring-matching the file text so
example snippets in operator-runbook comments do not produce false
positives or negatives.

A separate subprocess-driven test verifies that ``docker compose
config`` parses the merged base + shared-mode override and surfaces
the hardening fields on the merged result.  That test skips when
Docker is not available on the test host (matching the C-32/C-33
patterns in the sibling ``test_deploy_configs.py`` and
``test_proxy_trust_and_headers.py``).

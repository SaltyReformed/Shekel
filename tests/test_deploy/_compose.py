"""The bundled nginx image, read from the ONE file that declares it.

``docker-compose.yml``'s ``nginx`` service is the repo's only statement of
which nginx it ships, so the deploy tests that run ``nginx -t`` (or stand a
proxy up) read the tag from there instead of restating it: a Dependabot bump
of the compose (``#434`` moved it 1.27 -> 1.29 while two test modules still
said 1.27) then moves the tested parser in the same commit, with no second
spelling to fall behind.

What this is NOT: the version fronting production.  The prod override parks
the bundled service and the shared ``/opt/docker/nginx`` container proxies
Shekel; its tag lives in ``/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml``, outside this
repo, and on 2026-09-20 it ran ``nginx:1.31.6`` against the bundled
``1.29-alpine`` here -- so the shared-vhost parse test grades the config
under a different minor line than production parses it with.  Nothing in
this repo establishes that parity; the docstring states the gap rather
than a wish.

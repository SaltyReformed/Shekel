"""Tests for the version-controlled deployment configurations under deploy/.

Covers remediation Commit C-32 (audit finding F-021): nginx and compose
configs that were running only on the production host are now committed
into the repo. These tests guarantee that:

1. The expected files exist with the structural shape the runbook and
   docker-compose.yml depend on.
2. The bundled-mode Nginx config is syntactically valid (parsed by
   ``nginx -t`` inside an ephemeral nginx:alpine container).
3. The shared-mode compose override parses correctly when merged with
   the base ``docker-compose.yml`` (parsed by ``docker compose config``).

Both subprocess-based tests are skipped when Docker is not available on
the test host (e.g., CI sandboxes that do not expose the Docker socket).

"""The five workloads the audit trigger is graded and timed on (plan step balance:X-cy).

**ONE definition with two readers, and the line between them is ruling
balance:R-BAL144, 'Count work, report time'.**

* ``tests/test_integration/test_audit_trigger_work.py`` is the REQUIRED gate.
  It runs each workload's act with the audit trigger on and asserts what the
  trigger DID -- exactly one ``system.audit_log`` row per
  ``budget.transactions`` row the act changed -- and that the trigger's cost
  surface is the one the timings below were measured against
  (:data:`PINNED_COST_FINGERPRINT`).  It sits in the ordinary suite, so every
  local run grades it and so does CI, on whichever shard ``tests/_shard.py``
  assigns each case (**R-BAL151**).
* ``tests/test_performance/test_trigger_overhead.py`` is the timing REPORT.  It
  times the same acts with the trigger on and off and prints the ratio, and it
  asserts nothing about time (**R-BAL152**).

A wall-clock ceiling was the gate until this step, and on GitHub's shared
runners it failed the required check four times in about fourteen hours with
no change to the trigger (finding **recurrence:REC-533**): the insert workload
read 32.6%, 37.3% and 32.6% against a 25% ceiling set from a dev box that
measured 6-12%.  A count is deterministic, and a trigger that does more work
per row changes its cost surface, which the pin catches without a clock.

**Every workload changes rows on EVERY run, and two of them did not until this
step** (**R-BAL150**; measured 2026-09-25 on the test image, PostgreSQL 18.6).
``regenerate`` has maintained its rows in place since plan step R10-a, so a
pass over an unchanged template wrote nothing at all; ``update`` re-wrote the
note its first run had already written, which the trigger's no-op guard
answers with no audit row.  Both were timed and printed as the trigger's
overhead while the trigger wrote nothing, and a count over either would have
passed with a trigger that writes no audit row at all.  :class:`Regenerate` now renames its
template before each pass and :class:`Update` alternates between two notes, and
the gate runs every workload twice to hold that.

    Read from the test database's catalogue, so what a MIGRATION adds to
    ``system.audit_log`` or ``budget.transactions`` -- a column, an index, a
    constraint, a rule, a policy, its storage -- is in it.  **What
    ``app.audit_infrastructure`` re-applies is the MODULE's, not a
    migration's**: the test template's build runs it after ``alembic upgrade``
    (``scripts/build_test_template.py``), so the trigger FUNCTION, its
    ATTACHMENTS and the module's own three audit-log indexes read here as the
    template installs them, whatever a migration would leave in production (a
    migration that DROPS one of those indexes is re-created over).  That
    divergence is finding **balance:BAL-556**, measured by this step's
    reviews: a migration that slowed the function and re-attached the trigger
    BEFORE left this surface unchanged.

    The reads run under ``search_path = pg_catalog``, set for this transaction
    only, because the catalogue's text names an object without its schema when
    the schema is on the path: a role or database default could otherwise move
    the fingerprint with nothing about the trigger changed.

        ``-- <title>`` line followed by that read's lines.

# 2026-08-28, FOURTEEN runs across a range of machine load (PostgreSQL 17):

#   regenerate -3.7 -   1.3 %      base 78-82 ms   (see below)

#   update    290.2 - 309.7 %      base  1.8-1.9 ms  (260 rows; see below)
#   delete     21.4 -  31.9 %      base  7.7-7.7 ms
#
# 2026-09-18, FIVE runs, ordinary load, after the insert, update and delete
# rows moved onto the one-off row placer (plan step balance:X-bi-7c):
#
#   insert      6.1 -  12.3 %      base 26-28 ms   (one INSERT + flush per row)
#   update    125.2 - 140.8 %      base  4.6 ms    (the notes column; 260 rows)

# audit row** (R-BAL150): regenerate's pass changed nothing, and every update
# sample after the first re-wrote the value the first had written (the amount

# of firing the trigger and computing a row's changed fields, not of auditing
# a change, and they do not compare with the block below.

# session's pytest live during all five), PostgreSQL 18.6 (the test image), on

# (the base is each run's median without-trigger time):

#: :func:`fingerprint_of` the :func:`cost_surface` of the database the

#: The reader was widened twice after that measurement, by this step's reviews;

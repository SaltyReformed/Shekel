    """Write a stub ``docker`` and ``pytest`` into a directory for ``PATH``.

    The docker stub answers only what the per-run branch asks and records
    each subcommand.  The pytest stub records the ENVIRONMENT it was handed,
    which is what the flag-scrub assertion reads.

    A case changes the stubs' behaviour by writing a file into ``tmp_path``
    (the ``survives`` paragraph names three more): ``run-seconds`` makes
    ``run`` sleep that many seconds before it acts, ``never-ready`` makes the
    readiness probe (``exec``) fail every time, and ``pytest-waits`` makes
    pytest run that many seconds, as the signal cases need.  pytest then
    writes ``pytest-running`` once it is ready for a signal, holding its PID
    and whether SIGINT reached it IGNORED (``1``) or at its default (``0``),
    as bash hands a background child it did not reset; at its default, a
    SIGINT ends that wait, and pytest writes ``pytest-interrupts`` a second
    later -- the number of SIGINTs it was sent (a second one passed on by the
    wrapper lands in that second), then ``waited`` if the wrapper, its parent,
    was still alive to wait for it, else ``orphaned`` -- and exits 2, as
    pytest does after a Ctrl-C.

    Args:
        tmp_path: pytest-provided scratch directory.
        rootless: Whether the stub daemon reports itself rootless.  Since
            ``balance:X-br-3`` the wrapper asks before starting anything, so
            a stub that answers nothing is refused -- which is the point.
        make_socket: Whether the stub container leaves a socket behind.  A
            container can report ready and still not have one; the cluster's
            start refuses to hand out a socket that is not there.
        survives: How many removals the stub container survives: the file
            ``stub-container``, which ``run`` makes holding its ``--label``,
            ``ps`` lists while its label is the filter's, and each ``rm`` of
            its id after that many removes.  While a file ``other-container``
            (ANOTHER run's container) exists, ``run`` refuses as docker
            refuses a name in use; a file ``run-kills-the-start`` makes
            ``run`` SIGKILL its start, ``after making`` the container or not.
        pytest_status: The status the stub pytest exits with, which the
            wrapper must exit with too.

    Returns:
        The directory to prepend to ``PATH``.

"""The throwaway cluster's one home starts a cluster and stops what carries its token.

``scripts/private_cluster.py`` holds the life of the cluster ``scripts/test.sh`` gives every
suite run, and that the release rehearsal kit is to start (step X-cx's K1a).  A cluster is
owned by a TOKEN its caller makes: the start labels the container with it as docker creates
it, and the stop removes only what carries it (the coordinator's ruling on K1a commit B,
2026-10-19).  These drive the module with a stub ``docker`` on ``PATH`` that keeps its
containers' names and labels, so they need no daemon, no image and no database; the
wrapper's own cases (the ``test_test_runner`` package) drive the same module through
``test.sh``.  What a REAL cluster does is graded by every suite run, which starts one here.

    unless ``socket`` is ``"missing"``, the socket in the directory mounted at ``/sockets``
    as postgres would; ``socket="pinned"`` then takes the write bit off that directory, so
    the socket cannot be unlinked and the directory survives a stop.  Given a ``run_error``,
    ``run`` instead writes those bytes on stderr and exits 125, making nothing.  ``ps``
    lists the ids of the containers whose label is exactly the one its filter names (any
    value, given only the key, as docker's filter does), or exits 1 as an ``unreachable``
    daemon does; ``rm`` removes the containers it is given by id or by name unless
    ``survives``; ``exec`` (the readiness probe) answers ``ready``.  The command
    named ``slow`` takes 2 seconds; a ``run`` CLI signalled in that wait exits at once and
    its create lands 0.5 s later, as the daemon finishes a create its CLI abandoned (the

"""Tests for the seed user script's production safety checks and
credential hygiene scrubbing.

Uses subprocess to test _check_production_password() in isolation.
The subprocess environment is carefully controlled:
  - Inherits PATH and Python-related vars (so imports work)
  - Sets FLASK_ENV and SEED_USER_PASSWORD explicitly
  - Does NOT inherit DATABASE_URL (prevents connecting to real DBs)

For the production cases, the script exits at the password check
before reaching create_app().  For the development case, the script
proceeds past the check and fails at create_app() (no DATABASE_URL),
but the test only verifies the password error is absent.

The TestSeedUserCredentialScrub class covers Commit C-34 / audit
finding F-022: after running, ``scripts/seed_user.py`` must remove
SEED_USER_PASSWORD and SEED_USER_EMAIL from its own ``os.environ``
and from the C-level environ array (so any child process inherited
via ``subprocess.run(env=os.environ)`` does not pick the credential
back up).  The companion ``unset`` step in ``entrypoint.sh`` is
covered by tests/test_deploy/test_seed_credential_hygiene.py.

    """Verify ``_check_production_password`` decides, and that the script asks it.

    **Two different questions, and they were one SUBPROCESS test each until
    2026-08-18.**  The guard's LOGIC is a pure function of two environment
    variables -- it reads them, returns or ``sys.exit(1)``s, and touches
    nothing else -- so it is graded in-process here, exactly and instantly.
    What genuinely needs a subprocess is the WIRING: that
    ``scripts/seed_user.py`` calls the guard AT ALL and calls it BEFORE
    ``create_app()``, which is the property its own docstring rests on ("Runs
    before create_app() so the check works even when DATABASE_URL is not
    set").  One case below carries that, and it is the production-REJECT case
    because it exits at the guard and so never builds the app.

    **What that split fixed.**  ``test_default_password_allowed_in_development``
    was the only one of the three whose password is ACCEPTED, so it was the
    only one that ran on into ``create_app()`` -- paying a full Flask +
    SQLAlchemy import to observe that a string was ABSENT from stderr.  It
    carried the 10-second budget sized for the two cases that exit at the
    guard, and it measured **10.04s** on CI's runner under twelve pytest
    workers (the app-importing cases elsewhere in this file are budgeted at
    20 and measured 9.96s, 11.61s and 11.98s in the same run).  An absence
    assertion behind a ten-second app boot is now a positive assertion about
    a function call: the guard RETURNS.
    """

        """WIRING: the guard decides before ``create_app()`` is ever called.

        The one subprocess case, and the only thing it is for.  It passes an
        EXPLICITLY EMPTY ``DATABASE_URL``, and that is the whole mechanism:
        ``app/config.py`` calls ``load_dotenv()``, whose default
        ``override=False`` leaves a variable already present in the
        environment alone -- so the repository's own ``.env`` cannot supply a
        database here, and ``create_app()`` cannot succeed.  The two orders
        are then distinguishable from outside:

        * guard first -- exit 1, stderr names the password;
        * app first -- exit 1 from the app build, and the guard is never
          reached, so the password message is ABSENT.

        The password assertion IS the control, and it was measured firing on a
        planted ``create_app()``-first ``__main__`` block.

        **Two earlier levers for this were measured BLIND** (2026-08-18), which
        is why the mechanism is spelled out.  Relying on the environment simply
        not having a database is true in CI and false on a developer's machine.
        Running from an empty working directory looked like the fix and is not:
        ``find_dotenv`` walks up from the CALLING FRAME's file, which is
        ``app/config.py``, so a SCRIPT invocation finds the repository ``.env``
        whatever the CWD -- it only follows the CWD when the caller has no file,
        as under ``python -c``, which is what the first probe used. Both plants
        PASSED against those two.

        It stays cheap for the same reason it is the honest wiring case: a
        rejected password exits AT the guard, so nothing is imported.

"""``scripts/seed_ref_tables.py`` repairs a database missing a ref row (ruling R-BAL123).

Finding **BAL-536**: the script built the app with a plain ``create_app()``,
whose eager ``ref_cache.init`` refuses a ref table that lacks a row for one of
its enum members -- so the operator's repair tool died on exactly the database
it exists to repair, before its seed ran.  It now builds the app without that
read (``init_ref_cache=False``), seeds, and commits.

**Run as a subprocess under the PRODUCTION config**, because that is the only
config in which the defect exists: the development and testing configs seed
the ref tables inside ``create_app`` itself (``app/__init__.py``'s
``_seed_ref_tables``) before the cache is read, which would mask it.  The
child is pointed at this test's own database, the one the engine is bound to,
with an explicitly EMPTY ``DATABASE_URL_APP`` (the config resolver reads it as
unset) so no other database can be reached.

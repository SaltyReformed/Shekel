r"""The test runner shares no operator variable with any other shell script.

``scripts/test.sh`` read the bare ``DB_CONTAINER`` from the environment to
name the test-db container.  ``scripts/backup.sh``, ``scripts/restore.sh``
and ``scripts/verify_backup.sh`` read the SAME name, from the SAME place, to
name the PRODUCTION container -- and ``restore.sh`` DROPs and re-creates the
database it is given.  One exported value therefore pointed both ways at
once: a worktree isolating its suite with ``DB_CONTAINER=<name>-test-db``
silently re-aimed ``restore.sh``, and an operator who exported
``DB_CONTAINER=shekel-prod-db`` for a backup then aimed the test runner's
``docker restart`` at production.  ``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh`` had already
sidestepped it by reading ``SHEKEL_DB_CONTAINER``; the test runner now reads
``TEST_DB_CONTAINER``.

Nothing structural stops the name coming back -- shell environments are one
flat namespace and the two scripts never import each other -- so the
invariant is asserted here rather than left to a reviewer's memory.

The comparison set is DISCOVERED, not listed
    An earlier draft of this module hand-listed "every script that writes to
    or destroys production data".  It was not that set; it was the residue of
    one ``DB_CONTAINER`` grep, and it silently omitted ``entrypoint.sh``
    (which runs ``alembic upgrade`` against production), ``backup_retention.sh``
    (which deletes backup archives) and two more.  A hand list cannot see a
    script written after it, which is the one case a guard is for.

    So the set is every ``*.sh`` under ``scripts/`` and ``deploy/`` plus the
    repository root, minus the runner itself.  No script inside those roots
    is exempted -- there is no per-file carve-out list to rot.  Be precise
    about what that does and does not buy, because the first draft of this
    paragraph overclaimed it: the ROOTS are still an allowlist, so a shell
    script added under ``tools/`` or ``.github/`` would not be compared, and
    the floor test below pins one member per root so a root that stops
    resolving fails loudly instead of shrinking the sweep in silence.
    Measured 2026-09-04: 19 scripts, zero collisions, so the broad form
    costs nothing today.

What the extractor matches, and which way it errs
    It collects UPPER-CASE names three ways: both expansion forms,
    ``${NAME}`` and the bare ``$NAME``, plus assignment targets, ``NAME=``
    and ``export NAME=``.  Each was added because the previous shape let a
    real regression through.  Matching only the braced expansion was this
    module's own first bug: the natural way a future session keeps the old
    spelling alive is

        if [ -n "$DB_CONTAINER" ]; then TEST_DB_CONTAINER="$DB_CONTAINER"; fi

    which is unbraced, and a braces-only extractor passes it silently.  Do
    not narrow the pattern back.  Nothing else catches that shape either:
    shellcheck flags UNQUOTED expansions, not unbraced ones -- SC2250 is
    optional and this repo's ``.shellcheckrc`` does not enable it, and
    ``scripts/test.sh`` itself expands ``"$TEST_DB_CONTAINER"`` unbraced
    throughout while shellcheck exits clean; count them with
    ``grep -o '\$TEST_DB_CONTAINER' scripts/test.sh | wc -l`` rather than
    trusting a number here (``grep -c`` counts matching LINES, so it
    undercounts any line carrying two expansions -- the first instrument
    written to replace an untrustworthy number was itself the wrong tool).
    This sentence carried a literal count twice and was wrong
    both times -- "seven", then "nine" against an actual twelve, each written
    just after editing the very file being counted.  A figure that must be
    re-derived on every edit of its own subject does not belong in prose, and
    the argument never needed it: what matters is that the form is used at
    all and that nothing else flags it.

    Case is the filter that keeps this quiet enough to live with.  Operator
    -settable variables in these scripts are ALL-CAPS by convention and
    script-internal ones are lower-case (``local_path``, ``deadline``,
    ``nas_tmp``), so upper-case-only drops the locals without dropping any
    name an export can reach.

    What this does NOT assert is that the runner's variables are unshared in
    general.  ``TEST_DATABASE_URL``, ``TEST_DB_PREFIX`` and
    ``TEST_TEMPLATE_DATABASE`` are deliberately shared operator variables --
    set in ``.env``, read by ``tests/conftest.py`` and
    ``scripts/build_test_template.py``, and exported by the runner on
    purpose.  Those consumers are PYTHON and are outside this sweep by
    construction; the invariant here is between the runner and other SHELL
    scripts, which is where the flat-namespace hazard lives.

    It still OVER-connects, deliberately: ``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh``
    assigns its own local ``DB_CONTAINER`` from ``SHEKEL_DB_CONTAINER`` and
    then expands it, so the extractor counts a name no export actually
    reaches.  Over-connecting is the safe direction for a guard -- the worst
    it can do is refuse a coincidence that was harmless, and the remedy is
    the same either way: give the test runner its own name.

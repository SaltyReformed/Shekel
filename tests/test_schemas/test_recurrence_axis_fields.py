"""
Shekel Budget App -- the two authored recurrence axes at the schema door (R7b-2)

``RecurrenceUnitField`` and ``PeriodPlacementField`` replaced
``RecurrencePatternField`` when plan step R7b-2 stopped the form posting a
closed-set pattern id: a submission now states ``(interval_n, unit, placement)``
and the write door encodes it.  The refusal moved with the vocabulary but its
SHAPE did not -- a submitted ``ref`` id must name a value the application
MODELS, which is narrower than "names a row", and the difference between the
two is a 500.

Three layers, and this file pins all three because each catches something the
others cannot:

1. :class:`~app.schemas.validation._helpers.RowId` -- does this digit string
   name a row AT ALL (``"007"``, ``" 2 "``, ``"0"`` do not);
2. the two ``_RefEnumField`` subclasses -- does that row name a value this
   application models, per axis, with a message naming the CONTROL the user
   touched;
3. :func:`~app.schemas.validation._helpers.validate_authorable_cadence` -- can
   the whole TRIPLE be stored, which is a property of no single field: until
   plan step R7c the cadence is stored as a closed-set pattern, and that set
   covers every N pay periods but only 1, 3 or 6 months, and pairs the
   first-paycheck placement with a ONE-month interval only.

Layer 3 is what a hand-assembled POST meets.  Nothing a user can assemble by
clicking reaches it -- the picker's options are derived from the same table
(``tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_picker.py``) -- and that is exactly why it
is tested here rather than trusted: it is the reason the write door's
``RecurrenceResolutionError`` stays a broken-invariant 500 rather than becoming
a user-facing path.

"""What a reviewed statement pass looks like on the wire -- plan step X-f6a-3c-2.

**This is where this arc's most expensive defect lived.**  At plan step
X-f6a-3b the create form's destination arm was spelled as an ABSENT
``transaction_id``, and the always-rendered, always-prefilled name box therefore
read as a destination of its own -- so the existing-envelope arm was
unreachable from a browser and the door refused all 66 of the developer's lines
that had one.  Three independent adversarial reviews found it; the route test
that should have caught it posted a payload no browser sends.

So this module grades the FORM SHAPE itself, against the two facts that made
that defect possible:

* a browser submits every control it renders, whether or not the owner touched
  it -- so an untouched control must be recognisable as untouched;
* which arm was chosen is a fact the form has to STATE, never one a reader
  infers from an absence.

The SCHEMAS are live and this module grades them.  **The READERS beneath it
changed twice.**  It drove ``batch_payload`` and ``hand_match_payload`` -- the
review queue's and the workbench's -- until plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-2``
deleted both pages, which left those two readers with no caller in ``app/``
(finding **bank_import:BI-479**); ``bank_import:X-gi-3`` deleted them.  Every
case here now drives the LIVE readers,
:func:`~app.schemas.validation.statement_reconcile.reconcile_payload` and
:func:`~app.schemas.validation.statement_reconcile.reconcile_match_payload`.

**The split was not the deletion BI-479 prescribed, and the difference is
measured.**  That row said the classes reaching the schemas THROUGH the two
readers go with the readers.  Taken literally that drops live coverage: the
three cases below on the NEW-ENVELOPE arm and on category optionality grade
:class:`~app.schemas.validation.statements.StatementPurchaseSchema` loading a
shape ``tests/test_schemas/test_statement_reconcile.py`` never loads, and they
are the arc's most expensive defect.  What went is every class and case whose
SUBJECT was the dead wire shape itself -- ``TestOnlyWhatWasTickedIsAnAct``,
whose subject is the ``apply`` index, and four cases that file already covers
through the live reader.

*A first draft of this paragraph also claimed ``TestThePassIsBounded``, and
both adversarial reviews of that draft measured the claim false: its subject is
:data:`~app.schemas.validation.statements.MAX_BATCH_ITEMS`, a LIVE rule, and
the reconcile file exceeds that ceiling with skips and incomes only -- so the
matches and creations terms of its sum were left unmutated on a door that MOVES
MONEY.  It is restored below, re-pointed.  The sentence was written last, about
the author's own deletion, which is the one claim a green suite cannot check.*

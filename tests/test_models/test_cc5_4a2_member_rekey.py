"""``2eabfa596ee0`` re-keys every row member onto its payment, REFUSES, and round-trips.

Plan step **credit_card:CC-5-4a-2**, rulings **R-CC43** and **R-CC45**.  The
migration's own grade -- Definition of Done item 7, the shape
``test_cc5_1_movement_account_key`` uses: the SHIPPED ``upgrade`` /
``downgrade`` driven over a database that holds accepted acts, because the
test template is built empty and the re-key's join would otherwise touch no
member.

**How a row member is staged.**  The app writes none any more (the accept
door names movements since ``CC-5-4a-1``), so each case accepts a real match
through the door, DOWNGRADES this revision (which restores the column and
re-keys nothing), and rewrites the member back to the shape production's 103
pre-``CC-5-4a-1`` acts hold -- ``transaction_id`` set to the row,
``transaction_entry_id`` NULL -- before driving the upgrade.

**The ids are made to diverge** (the review class ``CC-5-4a-1`` paid for: a
door reading a row by a movement's id passed every case while the fixture's
first entry and first row were both id 1): four purchases are recorded in an
envelope first, so no bill's payment id is any bill's row id.

**The controls that FIRE, and the mutation each was shown to fire under**
(``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard 4): recorded in the leaf's commit.

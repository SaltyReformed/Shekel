"""Tests for the E-19 / Commit 3 account-anchor invariant.

Migration ``cfb15e782f86`` made ``budget.accounts.current_anchor_balance``
and ``budget.accounts.current_anchor_period_id`` NOT NULL after
backfilling existing rows, and seeded a matching
``budget.account_anchor_history`` row for each.  **Ruling R-EH deleted both
columns at plan step X-f1c3c** -- they were a denormalized copy of that
history row -- so what remains of E-19 is the half that was always the fact:
every account carries an origination ASSERTION from the moment it exists, and
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_anchor` can answer for it.  That is
what deletes CRIT-01's four NULL-anchor forks now.

The tests exercise three layers of the contract:

  1. **Migration backfill** (C3-4) -- load the migration module dynamically
     and assert its ``DIAGNOSTIC_SELECT`` names the columns an operator needs
     when the backfill cannot resolve a row.

     **The two DATA-PATH cases (C3-1 / C3-2) were DELETED at plan step
     X-f1c3b**, under the precedent the developer set on 2026-08-03 for the 22
     historical-migration tests that migration ``a3f7c8e21b64`` stranded.  They
     ran ``cfb15e782f86``'s frozen ``INSERT_HISTORY_SQL`` verbatim against a
     database at HEAD, and that string inserts
     ``account_anchor_history.pay_period_id``, which ruling R-EO deletes.  The
     same three measured facts carry the deletion here: a real ``base -> head``
     upgrade is unaffected (``cfb15e782f86`` runs ~30 revisions before the
     drop, against a schema that still has the column -- verified by a clean
     template rebuild); on any database already past it the migration never
     runs again; and rewinding to it requires downgrading through
     ``a3f7c8e21b64``, whose downgrade REFUSES once any row carries a settle
     day.  **The backfill's data path is unreachable with data, permanently.**
     The alternative -- a fixture that ADDS the dropped column back to
     reconstruct a historical schema -- is the shape that ruling declined, and
     it is a larger reconstruction than the ``DROP NOT NULL`` the deleted
     fixture performed.

  2. **Model rejection** (C3-6) -- DELETED at plan step X-f1c3c.  It flushed
     an ``Account`` with NULL anchor columns and asserted ``IntegrityError``;
     ruling R-EH deleted the columns, so the state it refused is not
     expressible and the ``NOT NULL`` it graded does not exist.  The invariant
     that survives -- every account has a resolvable balance -- is now the
     ORIGINATION ASSERTION, graded by the creation-path cases below and by
     ``scripts/integrity_check.py``'s re-pointed BA-01.

  3. **Creation paths** (C3-5) -- the ``auth_service.register_user``
     signup path and the ``/accounts`` POST route both write the
     origination ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row at the moment the account
     exists.  Locks the spec contract "always create the origination
     assertion".  It also asserted the ``current_anchor_*`` columns until
     ruling R-EH deleted them, and the assertion's own pay period until ruling
     R-EO deleted that; what is asserted now is the balance and the DAY.

**A WHOLE SUITE was deleted at plan step X-f1c3c and the record belongs here**,
because this file owns what remains of the contract it graded.
``tests/test_models/test_anchor_fk_deferrable.py`` (264 lines) asserted that
``accounts.current_anchor_period_id``'s foreign key was
``NO ACTION DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`` -- the catalog state, the mapper
declaration, the ``SET CONSTRAINTS ... DEFERRED`` round-trip, and the
``IntegrityError`` a period delete raised while an account still pointed at it.
**Every one of those is a property of a column that no longer exists.**  The FK,
its deferrability and the ``_DEFER_ANCHOR_FK_SQL`` the pay-period reset used are
deleted with it (rulings R-EH and R-EO), so there is nothing left to assert: not
a weakened rule, an absent one.  What the deferral existed to PROTECT -- a
balance surviving a schedule rebuild -- is graded by
``tests/test_services/test_pay_period_reset.py``'s
``test_wipes_all_and_the_balance_survives`` and
``test_the_reset_preserves_every_balance_assertion``, and the migration's own
restore of the FK is graded by
``tests/test_models/test_anchor_cache_downgrade.py``.

        Arithmetic: the owner states they were last paid 6 days ago at a

        CONTAINS sign-up day.  The Checking account's origination ASSERTION

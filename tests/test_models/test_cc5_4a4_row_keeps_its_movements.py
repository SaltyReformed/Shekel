"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``: a row's delete never takes its movements.

Rulings **R-CC54** parts (2) and (3) and **R-CC64** (developer 2026-09-22):
the database stops cascading a row's delete to its payments and purchases, a
match's key to its payment or purchase stops cascading like its key to the
bank line, and the object layer stops cascading too -- "No door at any layer,
now or written later, can delete a row still holding a payment or purchase:
it errors where tests see it."

Three things are graded here, each against the SHIPPED schema or code:

* **the keys refuse** -- a bulk ``DELETE`` of a row holding a purchase (the
  shape the template, account and pay-period doors used), an ORM
  ``session.delete`` of one (the object layer's copy of the cascade, which
  flipping the database key alone would have left open), and a ``DELETE`` of
  a movement a match names;
* **the one act still removes a movement** -- explicitly, the row staying;
* **migration ``c4a4e7d1b9f2``** -- driven through its shipped ``upgrade`` /
  ``downgrade`` (Definition of Done item 7, the shape
  ``test_cc5_4a2_member_rekey`` uses): the three keys' exact definitions
  each way, the refusal on an act already naming no movement, which is
  the one state the deleted leftover-match check existed for, and the
  deleted-row triggers (ruling **R-CC89**) going and coming back with it.

The purchase is staged the way finding **CC-363**'s P5 measured it: a one-off
envelope 'Home Improvement' holding a $25.00 purchase recorded from the bank's
line through the real create door, which also records the match.

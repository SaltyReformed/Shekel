"""Schema and migration locks for the two dropped ``LoanParams`` columns.

E-18 / Commit 15 demoted ``budget.loan_params.current_principal`` and
``budget.loan_params.interest_rate`` from NOT NULL to nullable, and both are
GONE.  DH-#56 completed the OPT-1 drop for ``interest_rate`` (the loan's rate
lives in its origination :class:`RateHistory` row).  Plan step
``recurrence:R20`` (ruling **R-R72** part 3, finding **REC-519**) dropped
``current_principal`` by migration ``22b23085394d``: the balance the owner
states at setup is a dated assertion, recorded as a ``tracking_start``
:class:`LoanAnchorEvent`, where the column held it as a value nothing read.

Three locks land here:

* **Both columns are gone** -- ``information_schema`` confirms neither exists,
  so a migration or model edit that re-introduces a stored loan balance or
  rate is caught the moment it lands.  (Until R20 this module locked the
  demoted column's NULLABILITY and grepped ``app/`` for reads of it; a column
  that does not exist needs neither fence.)

* **The R20 migration's backfill arm fires for exactly the loan it names**
  (the old C15-5 round-trip pattern, run against the live test database): the
  downgrade's literal SQL re-adds the column, five loan shapes are planted,
  the migration's own backfill statement runs, and the upgrade's literal SQL
  drops the column again.  Only a loan the old door configured MID-LIFE
  (originated before its setup day, a stored balance, no assertion of its own
  -- a legacy ``origination`` row is not one) gets a ``tracking_start`` --
  dated its setup day, carrying the stored balance -- and neither a loan set
  up on its origination day, nor one whose stored balance is NULL, nor one
  the owner has trued up gets anything.  Without this the arm is graded only
  by the clone rehearsal, where it matched 0 of 2 production loans.

* **The migration declares its revision pair and a working downgrade** -- the
  same surface check ``test_loan_anchor_backfill.py::TestDowngradeSmoke`` makes
  on ``d3d25212504b``, made here on ``22b23085394d``.

    the post-migration schema for the tests that follow.  A control with a
    carve-out needs a case per direction: ``trued`` is the exclusion firing,
    ``legacy`` is the exclusion NOT firing where a looser reading would.

    The setup day is asserted against the SAME derivation the migration
    spells -- ``(created_at AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York')::date`` -- read
    off the planted row rather than off the wall clock, so the test cannot
    flake across the UTC-versus-Eastern midnight window the derivation exists

"""Tests for the efca4315bf81 ledger-account kind/loan schema migration.

Build-Order Step 4, Commit 2
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/implementation_plan_posting_ledger_loan_payments.md``).
The migration turns the implicit NULL-pattern row taxonomy of
``budget.ledger_accounts`` into an explicit ``kind_id`` discriminator and adds
the per-loan link:

  * ``kind_id`` -- a NOT NULL FK (RESTRICT) into ``ref.ledger_account_kinds``,
    added in three steps (add nullable, backfill from each row's column shape,
    tighten to NOT NULL);
  * ``loan_account_id`` -- a NULLABLE FK (RESTRICT) into ``budget.accounts``;
  * ``uq_ledger_accounts_loan`` -- partial unique on
    ``(user_id, loan_account_id, kind_id)`` WHERE ``loan_account_id IS NOT
    NULL``;
  * ``ck_ledger_accounts_loan_shape`` -- a column-shape CHECK confining a
    per-loan row to ``account_id`` / ``category_id`` NULL and ``NOT
    is_fallback``.

The migration is already at HEAD when these tests run (the template builder
upgraded base->head), so the per-worker DB shows the post-migration schema.
These tests assert, without re-executing DDL in the worker:

  * the migration is correctly chained (revision / down_revision);
  * the two columns exist with the right type / nullability, the two FKs are
    ON DELETE RESTRICT, and the partial unique + the shape CHECK exist with the
    model's exact predicates -- the proof that ``upgrade`` ran and matches the
    model (the behavioural proof that each constraint *enforces* its rule lives
    in ``test_ledger_account.py``; this file proves the named objects exist so
    the downgrade's drop-by-name will find them and that there is no
    model-vs-migration drift);
  * the three-step backfill's shape -> kind mapping (the
    ``_KIND_FROM_SHAPE_CASE_SQL`` constant) assigns the correct kind to a row of
    every shape -- evaluated as a SELECT because at HEAD ``kind_id`` is NOT NULL
    so the backfill UPDATE's ``WHERE kind_id IS NULL`` guard can never match a
    real row;
  * the ``downgrade`` is not a bare pass -- it drops every object the
    ``upgrade`` adds.

A full executable upgrade -> downgrade round-trip belongs in the Alembic-driven
environment, not an in-test xdist worker (executing the downgrade here would
DROP columns the whole session's ORM depends on, breaking every other test in
the worker).  The executable round-trip was run during development against the
prod-clone dev DB -- ``flask db upgrade`` created the objects, a re-run of
``flask db migrate`` produced an empty diff (model == migration), and ``flask
db downgrade`` removed them cleanly, returning the DB to the Commit-1 head -- so
the source-level downgrade check below is the safe in-worker analogue (the same
split the cash-posting schema migration test uses).

"""The row's figure columns are gone, and the migration that deleted them round-trips.

Plan step **balance:X-bi-4b-2**, rulings **R-BAL80**, **R-BAL82**, **R-BAL83**.
Migration ``45f10b870c8b`` deletes ``budget.transactions.settled_amount`` /
``settled_basis_id``, their three CHECKs, the FK and ``ref.settlement_bases``:
since ``X-bi-4b-1`` every reader of the settlement record asks the row's
covering movement, and the same fact in two homes is two sources (rule 14).

Three locks land here:

* **The columns, the CHECKs, the FK and the catalogue are gone** --
  ``information_schema`` and ``pg_constraint`` confirm it, so a migration or
  model edit that re-introduces a stored settled figure is caught the moment
  it lands.

* **The downgrade rebuilds the columns from the movements, exactly, and the
  upgrade takes them away again** -- the old C15-5 round-trip pattern, run
  against the live test database through the migration's own ``downgrade``
  and ``upgrade`` (:func:`~tests._test_helpers.run_migration_callable`, the
  ``_LATER`` idiom of ``test_one_level_relation_migration``).  Seven shapes
  are staged THROUGH THE DOORS -- a resolved bill, a typed correction, a
  ``$0.00`` close, an envelope closed from its purchases, a typed close
  reverted (the retained movement), a settled transfer pair and a row that
  never settled -- and the rebuilt columns are read by SQL, because the ORM
  no longer maps them: each row takes what the seam below would have
  written for it, every reader's answer is byte-identical across the round
  trip, and the second upgrade prints the same count.

* **Every refusal is DRIVEN** (``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard 4):
  the three fail-closed predicates of the upgrade and the one of the
  downgrade, each staged by SQL on the downgraded schema (no door writes any
  of them) and each shown to fire, with the ``$0.00`` exemptions shown NOT
  to.

**What this module does NOT grade, stated so it is not read as more.**
``tests/test_models/test_covering_cutover.py`` -- 25 functions (28 cases)
driving migration ``ad573b07bede``'s refusals, its cover write, its total-rule
proof and the deploy resync's ledger-net equality -- was DELETED whole at this
step (developer ruling **R-BAL84**, 2026-09-20), with the five cutover-arm
classes of ``test_amount_ownership.py`` and the pre-flight class of
``test_settlement_record.py``: every one staged a settled row carrying the two
columns this migration deletes, a state no door at head can produce.  Those
migrations' refusal, cover and restore ARMS are ungraded at head: they run only
on an old-dump restore, and a template build replays the chain over an empty
database.  The STATES they refused have homes -- a dateless settled row and an
undated movement are ``integrity_check`` DC-11's two arms
(``test_integrity_check.py``); a broken or missing shadow is the transfer
invariants' (``test_transfer_legs.py``, ``test_transfer_service.py::
TestRestoreTransfer``); a settled row recording nothing is the ``$0.00`` record
(``test_settlement_record.py``); a movement disagreeing with its row is this
module's second predicate; and the seam's own write per shape is
``test_covering_movement.py`` -- and the ledger-net equality the resync case
graded is the posting-ledger reconciliation oracles'
(``test_posting_ledger_*_reconciliation.py``) and this step's clone rehearsal
(the migration's docstring).  The per-class list is in the commit that
deleted them.

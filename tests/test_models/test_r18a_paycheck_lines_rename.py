"""Migration ``0a4d2c3e89f8`` -- a paycheck is base pay plus a list of lines.

Plan step **salary:R18-a** (ruling **R-SAL38**; ledger row **D59**): the
RENAME of ``salary.paycheck_deductions`` to ``salary.paycheck_lines``, of
``ref.deduction_timings`` to ``ref.paycheck_line_kinds`` (its two rows to
``pre_tax_deduction`` / ``post_tax_deduction``), of the kind column and of
the owning arm's column on ``budget.recurrence_rules`` -- with every
artifact the tables carry renamed beside them.  Every assertion reads the
CATALOGUE for the objects, both directions are driven through the
migration's own shipped callables, and the migration's own claims about
itself are graded hardest: that it moves every artifact (the catalogue is
compared whole, not by the names it lists), that a row survives the round
trip unchanged, that the audit trigger fires on the renamed table under
its new name and only its new name, and that the downgrade REFUSES a kind
name the old column cannot hold.

**Leaf R18-b (``6c15d2a97b78``) sits above this revision** and seeds the two
earning kinds, whose names the pre-rename column cannot hold; so the round
trip here runs R18-b's own ``downgrade()`` first and its ``upgrade()`` last
(Alembic's newest-first order, the stacked shape of
:func:`~tests._test_helpers.rewind_pay_schedule_rhythm`), and the refusal
case needs no seeded row of its own: R18-b's rows ARE the refusal.

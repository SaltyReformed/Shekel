"""``salary.salary_raises.terminal_year`` -- plan step **salary:S3-b**.

The additive half of ruling **R-SAL11**: the last year a raise is believed
to happen is a fact ON THE RAISE, ``NULL`` meaning indefinitely.  This step
adds the column and its three CHECKs and writes no value; the reader, the
write door and the deletion of
``auth.user_settings.merit_raise_horizon_years`` are the cutover step's.

**What these tests grade, and why the identity case is the important one.**
:func:`app.services.salary_raises.apply_raises` has read this attribute
through ``getattr(raise_obj, "terminal_year", None)`` since plan step
**salary:S3-a**, so the column is LIVE to the paycheck engine the moment it
exists on the model -- there is no dormant period to rely on.  The migration
therefore claims something specific: that an all-``NULL`` column is the
identity, because ``NULL`` is exactly what that ``getattr`` answered when
the attribute did not exist.  That claim is the one thing the rest of the
suite cannot see, since every existing test passes rows whose answer is
unchanged either way.  :class:`TestTheColumnIsLiveAndNullIsTheIdentity`
states both directions of it.

Four classes, each grading a different tier, because an adversarial review
of this step found the first draft grading only one:

* :class:`TestTerminalYearChecks` -- the three CHECKs, through raw SQL.
* :class:`TestTheColumnStoresNothingByItself` -- the live catalog: nullable,
  and no ``server_default``.  Asked of PostgreSQL rather than of the model,
  because a migration can add a default without touching the class and
  SQLAlchemy omits a valueless column from the INSERT, so the database's
  default would fire with every model-level assertion still green.  That is
  the F-068 / F-134 drift class ``test_c25_column_invariants`` exists for.
* :class:`TestTheColumnIsLiveAndNullIsTheIdentity` -- the arithmetic.
* :class:`TestTheMigrationDoesWhatItSays` -- what ``upgrade`` and
  ``downgrade`` actually CALL, since a constraint defined and never created
  is the silent form of this failure and CI runs only the upgrade
  direction.

The CHECK tests go through raw SQL rather than the ORM so the assertion is
about the STORAGE tier and nothing else.  *No form layer is being bypassed
today* -- ``terminal_year`` is in no Marshmallow schema and no template, so
there is nothing above the database to refuse first.  An adversarial review
of this step corrected a draft of this paragraph that borrowed the C-24
sweep's rationale wholesale; that rationale becomes true at the cutover, and
these tests are already the right shape for it.

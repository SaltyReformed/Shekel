    Two arms, decided by whether *overrides* names a definition:

      that template in the named paycheck (:func:`generate_row_of`, plan step
      balance:X-cf), flushed, with every OTHER override then laid onto it

      case that means the OWNER's re-priced row states ``amount_ownership``
      and ``is_override`` and gets exactly the two acts the re-price door
      performs.  ``pay_period_id`` picks the paycheck the engine writes into
      and is not restated afterwards.
    * **A BARE row** (no ``template_id``, or ``None``) is constructed by hand
      and returned UNFLUSHED, naming a rule-less definition of its OWN
      (below).

    Args:
        seed_user: The ``seed_user`` fixture payload.
        seed_periods: The ``seed_periods`` fixture list.  A ``pay_period_id``

    so every row staged here names its own definition
    (:func:`~tests._test_helpers.bare_expense_template`) and carries its
    paycheck's start as the day it is due and the occurrence it answers --

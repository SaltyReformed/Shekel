"""Migration ``d2e9f4a17c63`` -- one level relation (plan step ``balance:X-bj-1``).

Both directions are driven through the migration's own shipped callables
over a world holding what production holds -- an owner's assertions and a
placed statement -- plus the one shape production does not: a placement a
later import RELEASED.  Every assertion reads the DATABASE, and the
migration's claims about itself are the ones graded hardest: that the
backfill is a fast default that fires no trigger and writes no audit row,
that a standing placement round-trips onto the import row and back, and
that a released one writes back nothing (the state the old UPDATE-release
left) and is honestly gone after the next upgrade.

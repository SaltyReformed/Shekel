"""Tests for the 97bc03c2aa4c cash-posting ref-values migration.

Build-Order Step 3, Commit 1
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/implementation_plan_posting_ledger_cash_envelopes.md``).
The migration adds reference VALUES (not tables) to two ``ref`` lookup
tables Step 2 created: the ``income`` / ``expense`` kinds to
``ref.posting_kinds`` and the ``transaction`` source to
``ref.posting_sources``.

The migration is already at HEAD when these tests run (the template builder
upgraded it base->head), so the per-worker DB shows the post-migration
state.  These tests assert, without re-executing DML in the worker:

  * the migration is correctly chained (revision / down_revision);
  * this migration's own contribution is present in the live tables
    (``income`` / ``expense`` kinds, ``transaction`` source) -- the Step-2
    ``transfer`` rows are asserted by f5037400dc5e's own test, and the
    cumulative inline-seed coverage for every enum member lives in
    ``test_posting_ref_seed_parity.py``;
  * the ``downgrade`` is not a bare pass -- it deletes exactly the three
    rows the ``upgrade`` adds.

A full executable upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade round-trip belongs in the
Alembic-driven environment, not an in-test xdist worker.  Even though this
migration's downgrade is a row ``DELETE`` (not a ``DROP TABLE``, so it
needs no ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock), mutating these ``ref`` rows inside a
worker would desync the framework's session-scoped ``ref_cache`` -- it is
initialised once per session from these exact rows, and every other test
in the worker reads the cached IDs -- so the source-level downgrade check
is the safe analogue of the one used for f5037400dc5e and the loan-anchor
migration.  The executable round-trip was run manually against the
prod-clone dev DB during development (downgrade removed the three rows;
re-upgrade restored them identically).

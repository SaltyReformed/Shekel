"""Naming invariant regression tests for budget.interest_params.

Locks the post-rename state of every database artifact attached to
``budget.interest_params``: PK constraint, FK constraint, backing
sequence, indexes, and audit trigger.  All five must carry the new
``interest_params`` prefix; none of the legacy ``hysa_params``
artifacts must remain.

Without the M-1 fix migration
(``44893a9dbcc3_finish_hysa_to_interest_params_rename.py``), a
fresh-from-migrations DB carried both the renamed table and a
legacy ``audit_hysa_params`` trigger that the rebuild migration
never dropped, double-firing into ``system.audit_log`` on every
``interest_params`` write.  This test guards against:

  * Future migrations re-introducing legacy names (a new ALTER
    that uses ``hysa_params_pkey`` would fail loudly here).
  * Future ``apply_audit_infrastructure`` changes accidentally
    creating a second trigger alongside the canonical one (the
    audit-trigger assertion below counts exactly one
    ``audit_*`` trigger on the table).

Audit reference: M-1 of
docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/model-migration-drift.md.

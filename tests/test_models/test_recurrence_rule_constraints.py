"""Database CHECK constraint regression tests for budget.recurrence_rules.

Locks the STORAGE tier: what the table itself refuses, with no service, no
schema and no form in front of it.  Two families live here.

**The last day bound left at plan step recurrence:R5-a with its column.**
``ck_recurrence_rules_due_dom`` (migration f15a72a3da6c) bounded
``due_day_of_month`` to 1..31; ruling **R-R96** dropped the column (a rule's
own day is the day its rows are due), and its three cases went with it.

**Two SIBLING bounds left at plan step R7c-c with their columns.**
``ck_recurrence_rules_dom`` and ``ck_recurrence_rules_moy`` (both migration
1702cadcae54, the H-3 fix) bounded ``day_of_month`` and ``month_of_year``, the
storage encoding the write door derived from the resolved first occurrence.
Ruling **R-R16** collapsed both into ``starts_on`` -- a real DATE, which cannot
hold a 99th day or a 15th month at all -- so the states those CHECKs refused
are unrepresentable rather than refused, and
``ck_recurrence_rules_starts_on_range`` is what bounds the value that replaced
them.  This file's own docstring predicted the retirement one leaf earlier.

**The two CHECKs plan step R7c-b added**, which is the other half of that
step: with the two-axis columns authored and ``NOT NULL``, the table can state
rules it previously could not, and each closes a state a service guard used to
stand in for.  A THIRD was drafted -- ``end_date >= starts_on`` -- and held
back on a developer ruling until plan step R7d-g landed it as
``ck_recurrence_rules_valid_window``; :class:`TestTheWindowIsHeldAtTheTableToo`
carries the reason for the wait and pins the state it now refuses.

  * ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day -- COMPLETED at R7c-b with the clamp
    equality, which is what let ``_occurrence._require_generable`` lose its
    third refusal;
  * ck_recurrence_rules_starts_on_range -- the first occurrence falls inside
    the calendar this application reaches.

Every rule here is built COLUMN BY COLUMN rather than through
``recurrence.author_rule``, and deliberately: the door refuses each of these
values before it writes, so authoring one would exercise the door and prove
nothing about the table.  :func:`_storable_columns` supplies the four ``NOT
NULL`` columns every row needs so that the INSERT reaches the CHECK under test
rather than dying on a null.

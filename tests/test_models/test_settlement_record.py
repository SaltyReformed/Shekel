"""The settlement RECORD: what a row asserts, and what it merely remembers.

Plan step **X-au-c3**: *a row is a PLAN -- ``estimated_amount`` priced by
``amount_source_id`` -- until its money moves, and a RECORD of what moved once it
has.*  The two are NOT one fact with one lifetime, and believing they were is
the error this module grades the correction of.  WHAT MOVED is the row's
COVERING MOVEMENT -- a row of ``budget.transaction_entries`` carrying the
figure and who wrote it (``status_seam._covering``), the record's ONE home
since plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-2`` (ruling **R-BAL80**; through
``X-bi-4b-1`` the row's own ``settled_amount`` / ``settled_basis_id`` carried a
second copy, written by the seam and, from 4b-1, read by nothing); ``settled_on``
(with ``reconciled_by_id``) is the ASSERTION that it moved on a named day, and a
revert withdraws the assertion while KEEPING what moved (the movement, un-dated,
since ``X-bi-3e-2``).

**Both tiers read the row's ENTRIES** -- ``row_valuation.settled_figure`` and
``posting_reads.settled_figure_clause`` -- and a settled row holding none is the
``$0.00`` record (ruling **R-BAL82**): a movement of nothing is not one, so a
close of nothing has no entry.  The cases that read a figure lay the movement
(:func:`~tests._test_helpers.cover_bare_settled_row`), and the case that once
graded the reader's REFUSAL of a settled row recording nothing grades its
answer.

**The record's invariants are the CONSTRUCTOR's**
(:class:`app.services.status_seam.Settlement`), and this module is where that
is graded: a settle door BUILDS a ``Settlement`` to hand the seam, so a
malformed record cannot be constructed and therefore cannot be written.  Two
CHECKs stated the storable half of the pairing while the row carried the
columns -- ``ck_transactions_settled_amount_needs_basis`` (a stored figure
names its provenance) and ``ck_transactions_settle_day_needs_a_record`` (a row
asserting a settle DAY records what moved), both IMPLICATIONS after a draft's
BICONDITIONAL (``ck_transactions_settlement_recorded``) made every revert
destroy the user's figure -- and went with the columns; the states they
refused are now either unconstructible (a figure with no writer) or legal (a
dated close of nothing).

**Every test here is a FIRING CONTROL** (``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard
4).  A test that merely asserted a rule EXISTS would pass against a rule
admitting everything, so each one below writes the state the rule is supposed
to refuse and asserts the refusal, or writes the legitimate state and asserts
what both tiers read.

The shapes under test, and the real writer each stands for:

* **a figure stating no writer, and a writer stating no figure** -- the
  constructor invariant, from both sides; a door that writes what moved and
  forgets who said so is the overload ``actual_amount`` carried;
* **a settled row asserting a DAY and holding no entry** -- the ``$0.00``
  record, dated: legal, and read as ``0`` by both tiers;
* **a Projected row still holding its un-dated movement** -- the RETAINED
  state a revert leaves, which a draft refused and which is worth nothing to a
  balance because the STATUS decides;
* **the whole record together** -- the legitimate act, read off the movement
  by both tiers even where the row's plan says otherwise;
* **entering the settled band with no record at all** -- the seam's own
  refusal, which is what makes "a settled row states what moved" a property of
  the seam rather than a convention its callers keep.

# ``TestTheUpgradeRefusesASettledRowWithNoFigure`` -- two cases that renamed

# ``e4b8a71c0f36``'s pre-flight ``refuse_settled_rows_without_a_plan`` -- was
# DELETED at plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-2`` (developer ruling R-BAL84,
# 2026-09-20): its staged input, the row's own figure column, cannot be built
# at head once migration ``45f10b870c8b`` deletes it.  **That pre-flight is
# UNGRADED at head**: it runs only on an old-dump restore (the test template
# replays the chain from base over an empty database, where it refuses
# nothing), and no test at head drives it.  What head grades instead is the
# state it refused, a settled row storing no figure, which is the ``$0.00``
# record now (``TestTheRecordIsTheCoveringMovement::
# test_a_SETTLED_row_holding_no_entry_records_ZERO_and_never_its_plan``), and
# that ``45f10b870c8b``'s downgrade rebuilds the column the pre-flight read
# from the movements exactly (``test_the_record_is_its_movements``).


class TestTheSQLTierReadsTheSameHomeAsPython:
    """``posting_reads.settled_figure_clause`` and ``settled_figure`` agree.

    **Measured 2026-08-17 by an adversarial mutation pass**: reverting the SQL
    expression of the time to the ``COALESCE(settled_amount, Sigma(entries))``
    it replaced left the entire suite green -- so its stated reason to exist
    had no firing control at all, and this class became one.  Through
    ``X-bi-4a`` the two tiers disagreed on exactly ONE row, a settled row
    recording NOTHING (Python refused, SQL had to be made to answer ``NULL``
    rather than ``0``), and that difference was money:
    ``posting_service._settle_effective`` is a LOOKUP, not a fold -- it
    refuses a ``None`` and posts nothing, where a ``0`` is a figure it would
    post.

    **Since plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-1`` both tiers read the row's ENTRIES**
    (ruling **R-BAL80**), and a settled row holding none is the ``$0.00``
    record on both (ruling **R-BAL82**); the row the two disagreed about has
    one answer.  The cases grade that agreement from both sides: the empty
    row, and a row whose covering movement carries its figure while its plan
    says something the readers must NOT be reading.

"""Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``: the database keeps money out of a deleted row.

Ruling **R-CC89** (developer 2026-09-23), its first layer: *"The database refuses
any payment or purchase written under a deleted row, so no door, now or later,
can do it."*, and **R-CC92** extending it the same day ("Refuse both ways"): *"The
database also refuses hiding a row that still holds a payment or purchase,
except a transfer's half (BAL-532's, until X-bi-6-4). The check runs when the
change is saved, so a door that takes the money off and hides the row in the
same save still works."*  Review 3 measured the door that made the rule
necessary: a stale popover's Actual correction wrote a $125.00 payment record
under a deleted Paid Hotel, which locked its pay period and refused Reset for
good.  The pages' and writers' layers are
``tests/test_routes/test_cc5_4a4_hidden_row_doors.py``; this grades
:mod:`app.deleted_row_infrastructure`'s two triggers against the database the
suite runs on, with raw SQL where a writer nobody enumerated would use it.

Four things are graded, each against its control:

* **a movement cannot ARRIVE under a deleted row** -- an ``INSERT`` (raw, and
  through the ORM) or an ``UPDATE`` re-pointing one there is refused, and the
  same statement against a live row lands;
* **a row cannot be HIDDEN holding one** -- refused at COMMIT, so the delete
  door's own shape (the money off and the row hidden in one save) commits and
  an empty row hides; a transfer's twin was excepted until plan step
  ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``, which retired the exception (design D7) and gave
  the TRANSFER the same rule, so neither a twin nor a transfer can be hidden
  holding a payment (finding **BAL-532**'s state, unstorable since);
* **what is neither passes** -- a movement a hidden transfer holds can still
  be written in place and taken off inside the save that hides it, so the
  delete door's own order is not refused by this rule;
* **both are installed at head**, where the suite's template carries them.

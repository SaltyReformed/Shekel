"""
Shekel Budget App -- migration ``993eae6ade80``: a transfer holds its settled figure.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``'s 4d-4 half (rulings **R-BAL365**,
**R-BAL366**).  The revision gives a settled transfer's figure and who wrote it
ONE home on ``budget.transfers``, copied off its side records, and refuses
while the records do not state one figure.  Each case downgrades a head
database through the revision (the columns go; the records' copy is the only
one again), stages a state, and drives the upgrade or the downgrade, graded on
what the database holds after.

"""Tests for the c7d1e9a4b2f8 shape-C data-boundary migration.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3`` (rulings **R-BAL45**, **R-BAL98**, **R-BAL99**,
**R-BAL101**, **R-BAL102**).  The migration is the step's DATA BOUNDARY: it
generalises the chart's bucket flag (``is_fallback`` -> ``is_owner_bucket``),
re-keys the bucket singleton onto ``(user_id, class_id, kind_id)``, renames
the shape CHECK with the column, seeds the ``transit`` chart kind and the
``transfer_movement`` posting source, and UNLINKS every ``loan_payment``
split from the loan-side shadow it carried (the split is a date-keyed
correction with no row link, R-BAL102; leaf 2).  It re-books NO posting: the
deploy's cash resync re-books the transfers through the go-forward writer
(R-BAL98), graded in
``test_posting_service.py::TestTheDeployResyncReBooksTheLegacyShape``, and the
unlinked splits already sit at their key, so the deploy's loan hook writes
nothing over them (graded in ``test_loan_posting_service.py``).

The migration is already at HEAD when these tests run (the template builder
upgraded it base->head), so the per-worker DB shows the post-migration
schema.  These tests assert, without re-executing DDL in the worker:

  * the migration is correctly chained (revision / down_revision -- off
    ``credit_card:CC-5-1``'s ``9900b309f0b0``, the head production carried
    when this step's release was cut);
  * the two reference rows exist and resolve through ``ref_cache`` to the
    enum members the writer and the chart resolver name;
  * the ``downgrade`` tears down in the only order the balanced-entry
    invariant and the RESTRICT keys permit -- the ``loan_payment`` entries
    WHOLE (the old image's loan hook re-posts them keyed by shadow), the
    ``transfer_movement`` entries WHOLE before the ``transit`` chart rows, the
    chart rows before the reference rows -- and renames every object back to
    its ``45f10b870c8b``-era name and key;
  * the upgrade's loan-split UNLINK executes against a linked split and leaves
    none linked, and its grade refuses a split it could not unlink.

The renamed column, index and CHECK are asserted at HEAD by
``test_posting_cash_schema_migration.py`` (the migration that added them,
re-expressed for the rename).  The executable upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade
round-trip was run during development against the prod-clone
``shekel_xbi63`` (2026-09-21) on LEAF 1's migration: the ledger's 1,277
entries and 0.00 trial balance untouched in both directions, the two
reference rows seeded and removed, the index re-keyed and restored.  That
measurement predates leaf 2 and no longer describes the ledger half: the
upgrade now UPDATEs every linked ``loan_payment`` entry (25 on the
2026-09-20 restore; their links cleared, their legs unchanged) and the
downgrade DELETEs every ``loan_payment`` entry whole, graded here by
:class:`TestTheSplitUnlinkExecutes` and :class:`TestDowngradeExecutes`.

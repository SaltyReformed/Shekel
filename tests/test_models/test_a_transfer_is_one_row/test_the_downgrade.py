    Head's revision (:data:`_ABOVE`) goes down before this one's second
    downgrade and up after its last upgrade, as the chain does.

    From ``e616adf7fe22`` the app writes a settle, revert or cancel on the
    transfer and its sides' records and never on a twin, so afterwards the
    twins' status is not their transfer's, by design (cp1d review M-1).  This
    revision's upgrade does not refuse that (the status is not a copied
    field), and its downgrade re-reads each twin's status from the transfer
    and its day, basis and link from its side's record, which is what
    ``e616adf7fe22``'s downgrade census requires: the route that revision's
    own refusal prescribes, back to head.  Not inside a nested application
    context, for the chain test's reason.

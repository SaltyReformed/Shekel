"""A recurrence rule is owned by its definition, and the schema says so.

Plan step **recurrence:R-F6**, finding **F-6**: *a hard-deleted template leaves
its recurrence rule behind forever.*

**These are the cases the whole step exists for, and none of them existed
before it.**  The suite was green while three orphaned rules sat on production,
because every test asserted what the application DID with a rule and none
asserted what happened to the rule when its definition went.  The four
properties below are the ones the schema now carries:

1. **The leak is closed at the door that opened it** -- hard-deleting a
   definition through its ROUTE disposes of its rule, for both kinds.  This is
   F-6 itself, driven end to end rather than at the model.
2. **The disposal is RECORDED.**  ``budget.recurrence_rules`` is in
   ``audit_infrastructure.AUDITED_TABLES`` and a cascaded DELETE fires
   row-level triggers, so a rule that goes leaves a row in
   ``system.audit_log`` carrying the whole thing it was.  In a budgeting app a
   silent destruction is the defect even when the destruction is correct.
3. **An orphan is INEXPRESSIBLE**, not merely absent: ``ck_recurrence_rules_one_owner``
   refuses a rule with no definition and a rule with two.
4. **1:1 is structural.**  ``uq_recurrence_rules_transaction_template_id`` and
   its transfer twin refuse a second rule on one definition, which is what the
   runtime census ``_rule_is_exclusively_owned`` used to ask on every clear.

Every one is a FIRING CONTROL: remove the constraint it names and the case
fails.  That is what makes them different from asserting a state that was
already true -- ``docs/plans/verification.md``'s standard.

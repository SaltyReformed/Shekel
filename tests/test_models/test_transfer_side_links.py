"""Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``: a transfer side's payment hangs off the transfer.

Ruling **R-BAL88** (developer 2026-09-20, "Two side-keyed links"): a transfer
side's payment record names its transfer by one of two link columns, each in a
COMPOSITE key with the record's ``account_id`` onto that side's endpoint, under a
CHECK that exactly one parent is set.  *"The side IS which column is set, and the
account IS the endpoint -- structurally, no trigger.  The bug's row is
UNSTORABLE."*  Ruling **R-BAL107** ("Key transfer accounts to owner") keys each
endpoint to the transfer's owner, so a record is the owner's by the chain.
Ruling **R-BAL168** makes the side keys ``ON UPDATE CASCADE``: an endpoint move
carries the record.  And the deleted-row rule (rulings **R-CC89**, **R-CC92**)
gains its transfer arm, :data:`app.deleted_row_infrastructure.TRANSFER_ARM`.

Each case writes the state with raw SQL or the bare ORM, the way a writer
nobody enumerated would, against the database the suite runs on, and each
refusal sits beside its control: the like write the rule lets through.  The
records planted are KEPT
un-dated ones (a revert's, ruling R-BAL61) under a Projected transfer, the one
side-record state no settle verb is needed to reach.  A side's record states
no figure: its transfer holds the one the records moved, and holds a record
on both sides or on neither (the band's figure arm, graded at COMMIT), so a
case that commits records plants the revert's kept PAIR and its transfer's
figure (:func:`_kept_pair`).

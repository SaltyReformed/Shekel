"""Migration ``e6b4a2d8c713``'s DOWNGRADE, executed against real posted rows.

The upgrade seeds three reference rows and moves nothing; the downgrade is
where the data work is, and it is the direction that can destroy a ledger in
silence.  ``budget.account_postings.ledger_account_id`` is ``ON DELETE
CASCADE`` (:mod:`app.models.journal_entry`) and the balanced-entry trigger has
no DELETE arm (:mod:`app.posting_infrastructure`), so a leg the move misses is
simply deleted with its chart row and the trial balance goes out with no error
raised anywhere.  A source-level check cannot see that; this suite runs the
statements.

**Executed, not read**, on the precedent
``tests/test_models/test_anchor_cache_downgrade.py`` sets: the repo's other
migration-direction suites settle for a source check because their DDL wants an
ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock that fights the xdist workers.  This downgrade contains no
DDL at all -- four DML statements and two ref deletes -- so there is nothing to
lock and every statement runs here exactly as ``downgrade()`` orders them.

The shapes it is run over are the ones the step actually produces: a natively
modelled account whose true-up books straight to its counter row, a RE-POINTED
account carrying the counter-only delta entry (the shape with no linked leg,
which is what makes the move non-trivial), and an account whose ``anchor_equity``
row does not exist, which is the only arm with nothing to move onto.

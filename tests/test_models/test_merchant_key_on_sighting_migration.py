"""Migration ``3ef820b7dd52`` -- the sighting names the merchant (``bank_import:X-f6b-1b``).

Both directions are driven through the migration's own shipped callables over
a world holding what production holds -- one import per line, every worded
sighting's word already a merchant row -- plus the three shapes production
does not yet: a line two imports sighted under two WORDS, a second-source
word that never got a merchant row (the held-line gap the old record door
left), and a line whose stored key is STALE against its sightings (finding
**BI-504**).  Every assertion reads the DATABASE, and the migration's claims
about itself are the ones graded hardest: that the upgrade points every
worded sighting at its account's row for that word and mints the row where
none exists; that the downgrade writes the line's key back as the model
reads it -- the EARLIEST sighting naming one, by act order, never the lowest
sighting id -- and the word back from the row; and that the downgrade
SWEEPS the merchants no line's key and no rule names, which is the invariant
the old schema held.

"""Tests for migration ``70680a4a7405`` (plan step salary:X-av-3a).

Rulings **R-SAL59** ("Dated pay list + forecasts") and **R-SAL60** ("Each
raise rounds"): the salary's stored fact moves from one undated yearly figure
(``salary.salary_profiles.annual_salary``) to a dated pay list
(``salary.pay_entries``), what ONE paycheck pays from a payday on.

* the upgrade writes ONE entry per profile, its yearly salary over its owner's
  paychecks a year, rounded HALF-UP to the cent, dated on the owner's first
  saved payday; the conversion is audited;
* it REFUSES, writing nothing, an owner with no saved payday, an owner with
  more than one pay era, and a raise landing on or before the first saved
  payday (an entry replaces every forecast raise due by its payday);
* the downgrade restores the yearly figure as the entry times its paychecks a
  year -- 26, 52, 24 or 12, each arm of the count run -- and refuses a profile
  holding pay history, a profile holding no entry, a multi-era owner, a raise
  its entry already holds, and (forced, since the refusals leave none) a
  profile the restore missed;
* the model and the migrated table agree.

Every figure is made up.  ``$52,000.13`` is chosen because it divides by 26
to exactly ``$2,000.005``: half-up gives ``$2,000.01`` where half-even would
give ``$2,000.00``, so the rounding rule is visible in one assertion.

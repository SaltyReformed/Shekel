"""Tests for the c8f2b6a41d93 recurrence anchor-subtype migration.

Plan step **R2b** of ``docs/plans/implementation_plan_recurrence_redesign.md``,
as amended by plan step **R2d**.  The migration adds ``max_occurrences`` to
``budget.recurrence_rules`` with its two bound CHECKs, creates the two 0-or-1
anchor subtype tables, and audits them.  It writes no data at all.

Three groups, and the split is deliberate:

* **Schema at HEAD.**  The migration is already applied when these run (the
  template builder upgraded base->head), so the column, constraints and
  subtype tables are asserted against the live catalogue rather than by
  re-running DDL in an xdist worker.  Every CHECK is additionally shown to
  REJECT the value it names -- a constraint nobody has seen fire is a
  constraint nobody knows is wired up.
* **The audit trigger actually FIRES on both subtype tables**, and writes the
  right ``row_id``.  This is the regression guard for a defect measured while
  building the step: the plan specified ``recurrence_rule_id`` as the sole
  primary key, and ``system.audit_trigger_func`` assigns ``v_row_id :=
  NEW.id``, so every INSERT into such a table dies with ``record "new" has no
  field "id"``.  A presence check on ``pg_trigger`` would NOT have caught it
  -- the trigger exists either way and fails at INSERT time.
* **The derived columns are ABSENT, and that is asserted.**  See
  :class:`TestTheDerivedColumnsAreAbsent`.

**What this file no longer covers, and where that coverage went.**  An earlier
version of this migration added four derived columns and backfilled all 50
live rules, so this file carried ~600 lines unit-testing a frozen COPY of the
derivation that lives in ``app.services.recurrence``.  Plan step R2d removed
the columns and the backfill with them, and the copy went too.  The derivation
itself is covered -- more thoroughly than the copy ever was -- by
``tests/test_services/test_recurrence_resolution.py``, which exercises the
real function at exact dates: six first-of-month cases where this file had
three, plus month-end clamping, totality past the horizon, and the malformed
input coercions.

The executable upgrade -> downgrade -> re-upgrade round trip is a
development-time step: it was run against the prod-clone dev database while
building R2d (13 columns -> 12 -> 13, 2 subtype tables -> 0 -> 2).  Executing
a downgrade inside an xdist worker would drop tables the whole session's ORM
depends on, so :class:`TestDowngradeIsAReversal` reads the migration's AST
instead -- parsed rather than grepped, because a name in a comment satisfies a
substring search.

    xdist worker -- it would drop tables the whole session's ORM depends on --
    so the executable round trip is a development-time step, run against the
    prod-clone dev database while building R2d.

    The reversal is EXACT rather than best-effort because this revision writes
    no data: both subtype tables are created empty and stay empty until plan
    steps R7c and R8, and ``max_occurrences`` has no writer until R8.  There
    is nothing for a downgrade to reconstruct.

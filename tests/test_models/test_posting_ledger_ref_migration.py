"""Tests for the f5037400dc5e posting-ledger ref-tables migration.

Build-Order Step 2, Commit 1
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/implementation_plan_posting_ledger_transfers.md``).
The migration creates the three ``ref`` lookup tables
(``ledger_account_classes``, ``posting_kinds``, ``posting_sources``) and
inline-seeds the Step-2 values.

The migration is already at HEAD when these tests run (the template
builder upgraded it base->head), so the per-worker DB shows the
post-migration state.  These tests therefore assert, without re-executing
DDL in the worker:

  * the migration is correctly chained (revision / down_revision);
  * the three ``ref`` lookup tables exist and ``ledger_account_classes``
    carries exactly its five classes with the correct ``is_debit_normal``
    flags (f5037400dc5e is the sole, permanent producer of that table --
    accounting has exactly five classes);
  * the Step-2 ``transfer`` kind and source are present.  Later Build-Order
    steps add more rows to ``posting_kinds`` / ``posting_sources`` via
    their own migrations (Step 3's ``income`` / ``expense`` /
    ``transaction``), so this file asserts only f5037400dc5e's own
    contribution; the cumulative inline-seed coverage for every enum
    member lives in ``test_posting_ref_seed_parity.py``;
  * the ``downgrade`` is not a bare pass -- it drops every table the
    ``upgrade`` materialises.

A full executable upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade round-trip belongs in
the Alembic-driven environment, not an in-test xdist worker: a
``DROP TABLE`` needs an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock that conflicts with the
ACCESS SHARE locks the framework's session-scoped ``ref_cache`` refresh
holds on these ref tables, so it dies on ``lock_timeout``.  This is the
same constraint that drove the ``loan_anchor_events`` migration test
(``tests/test_models/test_loan_anchor_backfill.py::TestDowngradeSmoke``)
to a source-level downgrade check.  The executable round-trip was run
manually against the prod-clone dev DB during development (downgrade
dropped all three tables and their owned sequences cleanly; re-upgrade
restored f5037400dc5e's five ledger classes and the ``transfer`` kind and
source it seeds).

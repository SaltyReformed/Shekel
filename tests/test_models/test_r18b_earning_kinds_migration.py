"""Migration ``6c15d2a97b78`` -- a paycheck has earning lines.

Plan step **salary:R18-b** (ruling **R-SAL38**; ledger row **D59**): the two
EARNING kinds join ``ref.paycheck_line_kinds``.  Every assertion reads the
DATABASE for the rows, both directions are driven through the migration's
own shipped callables, and its claim about itself -- that the downgrade
REFUSES, by name, while any line carries an earning kind -- is graded with
a seeded line and shown to name it.

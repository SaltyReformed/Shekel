"""A transaction's OWNER is a column, and two composite keys hold it there.

Plan step **pay_calendar:C13-a**, migration ``d4a92f6b13c8``, ruling
**R-PC32**.

**What the keys replaced.**  ``budget.transactions`` carried no owner: a row's
owner was its pay period's, and nothing required that owner to be its
ACCOUNT's.  So a row filed in one person's paycheck against another person's
account was a STORABLE state, refused only by whichever door happened to look
-- and every door that refuses a foreign row had to state the relationship by
hand, which finding **P75** counts nineteen times in ``app/``.

**Why the SHAPE of the keys is graded here.**  The nineteen comparisons each
restate the same premise in their own words, and plan step ``C13-b`` is what
retires them.  This file grades the premise itself, so the readers can go on
stating only what they read.  It is the shape
``test_c4b2_pay_period_schedule_key`` uses one table over, and for the reason
that file gives.

*Two suites outside this file assert a key by name, and neither is a second
home for what is graded here*: ``test_statement_match/test_candidates`` and
``/test_create`` each show that a case whose SUBJECT this step made
unstorable now meets a refusal, which is a fact about those suites' own
fixtures rather than about the DDL.

**Every negative here has a CONTROL beside it**, because a refusal that fires
for the wrong reason grades nothing: each cross-owner case is paired with the
same INSERT built consistently, which must SUCCEED.  Without that pair a typo
in a fixture would produce a green refusal over a row the database was
rejecting for some other constraint entirely.

**The user delete is DRIVEN rather than argued from the DDL.**  Whether a
``DELETE FROM auth.users`` succeeds depends on referential-trigger ORDER across
three cascades and two RESTRICTs, which no reading of the schema settles --
and the shape that ships was chosen BECAUSE driving it showed the obvious
alternative (``UserScopedMixin``'s ``ON DELETE CASCADE``) turned a refused
statement into one that empties the database.

        ``UserScopedMixin`` here would have given ``user_id`` an ``ON DELETE
        CASCADE``, and driving this statement under that shape on a clone of

        -- because with the transactions cascading directly, the
        ``budget.accounts`` RESTRICT that refuses the statement today has no
        row left to object about.

        ``transactions_account_id_fkey``.  A test that accepted either would
        pass just as well against the shape the ruling rejected reaching
        through a different door.

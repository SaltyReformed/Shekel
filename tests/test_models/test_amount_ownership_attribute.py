"""The amount-ownership pair is ONE attribute, and the illegal shape is unsayable.

Plan step **X-au-k**, ruling **balance:R-IW**.  Its sibling
``test_amount_ownership.py`` grades the DATABASE tier -- what
``ck_transactions_amount_ownership`` refuses a writer that is not this
application.  This module grades the tier above it: what this application can
express at all.

**The TYPE is total over ruling R-FI's two states**, and everything else is
refused.  A figure beside a relation is the stale derived amount the arc
deletes; an empty pair is a row that has stated no ownership, and it is spelled
``None`` on the attribute rather than as an instance of the class.

**The indirection that makes the type total is `from_columns`, and it is
load-bearing.**  SQLAlchemy builds a composite from raw column values inside
its OWN machinery -- ``get_history`` for the pre-change side of an attribute
that may never have been set, ``Session.is_modified`` on a pending row -- and
both hand it ``(None, None)``.  A validating class mapped DIRECTLY as the
composite therefore raises from inside a path no caller entered; the factory
absorbs the empty pair and answers ``None``.  A first version of this step
mapped the class directly and had to weaken the type to survive it.
:class:`TestTheFactoryAbsorbsTheEmptyPair` is the regression control, because
a later edit "simplifying" the factory away would break exactly it.

**Every test here is a FIRING CONTROL** (``docs/plans/verification.md``
standard 4): each writes the state the mapping is supposed to refuse and
asserts the refusal, rather than asserting that a guard exists.

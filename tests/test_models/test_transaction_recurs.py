"""
Shekel Budget App -- ``recurs``: the one accessor for "is there a cadence"

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-7a`` (ruling **R-BAL20**, every plan item has exactly
one definition).  ``TransactionTemplate.recurs`` states whether a definition
has a recurrence rule; ``Transaction.recurs`` delegates to it for the row.
Every site that read ``template_id IS NULL`` as *one-off* reads this instead,
so a RULE-LESS definition's row -- template-linked, no cadence -- behaves as
the one-off it is.  What is pinned here is the accessor itself: what it
answers on each shape, that it reads the DEFINITION and not the link, and
that neither class-level name can key a query (a plain property compares
``False`` to everything, so ``filter_by(recurs=True)`` would return no rows
with no error -- the silent shape ``_derived_flag`` exists to refuse).

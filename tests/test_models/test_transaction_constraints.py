"""Regression tests for the non-negative figure guarantees on a transaction.

Locks the guarantee that a row's estimated_amount and its settled figure
cannot hold negative values.  The plan's guard is the storage tier:
`ck_transactions_estimated_amount`, declared on the model
(`app/models/transaction.py`) and materialised by migration
`dc46e02d15b4_add_check_constraints_to_loan_params_.py`.  The RECORD's
guard is the constructor: `status_seam.Settlement.__post_init__` refuses a
negative figure, because the record lives on the covering movement since
plan step `balance:X-bi-4b-2` (migration `45f10b870c8b`, ruling R-BAL80),
whose own CHECK is `amount <> 0` (a merchant credit is a negative PURCHASE,
ruling bank_import:R-II), so the storage tier cannot say `>= 0` for it.
Through `X-bi-4b-1` the row's own `settled_amount` carried
`ck_transactions_settled_amount` (materialised by the same migration, renamed
with its column by `e4b8a71c0f36_settlement_record.py`), and the second and
third cases here graded that column; they grade the constructor and the
`$0.00` record now.

The original H-1 drift fix
(`migrations/versions/724d21236759_drop_redundant_transaction_check_.py`)
removed an older duplicate pair (`ck_transactions_positive_amount` /
`ck_transactions_positive_actual`) that the model never declared but
that the migration chain materialised under different names.  These
tests are the contract that the surviving constraints continue to
catch negative amounts -- if a future migration accidentally drops
both pairs, the test suite turns red here instead of letting a
negative-amount Transaction slip past the storage tier and into
balance projections.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Migration ``c81f0a5b3e27``'s downgrade (plan step X-f1c3c)

The migration drops ``accounts.current_anchor_balance`` /
``current_anchor_period_id``, and its downgrade restores them by DERIVING each
account's current balance assertion.  That derivation is the part worth
grading: the columns come back from a computation, not from a saved copy, so a
downgrade whose ordering disagrees with ``cash_ledger.resolve_anchor`` restores
a DIFFERENT balance than the one the app was showing, silently and for every
account at once.

**Executed, not read.**  The repo's other migration-direction suites settle for
a source-level check because the DDL they would run needs an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE
lock that conflicts with the xdist workers.  That constraint applies to this
migration's ``ALTER TABLE`` statements, and NOT to the SELECT its backfill is
built on -- so ``_CURRENT_ASSERTION_SQL`` is a standalone statement and this
suite runs it against real rows.  A source-level check cannot see an ordering
that has drifted; this one fails on it.

The DDL half (the columns, the CHECK, the deferrable FK, the fail-loud gate)
keeps the execution-anchored source check the standard prescribes, so an edit
that deleted a statement from ``downgrade()`` while keeping its constant fails
here too.

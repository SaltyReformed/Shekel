"""The deleted-row rule is built ARM BY ARM, and a revision declares its own.

Plan step **balance:X-bi-6-4d-2**.  :mod:`app.deleted_row_infrastructure` is
imported LIVE by ``c4a4e7d1b9f2``, which shipped before the transfer arm's link
columns existed; without a declared arm set a chain replay would install, at
that revision, a trigger naming columns the re-parent's revision adds, and the
test template (which replays the chain) would fail to build.  The construction
is :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure`'s, and so are the properties pinned here:

* the builder takes an explicit ``arms`` set and installs exactly it, the row
  arm's bodies byte for byte what ``c4a4e7d1b9f2`` shipped;
* the statement is TOTAL -- an arm the caller does not name is dropped, which
  is what makes the newest revision's tuple the whole of a migrated database's
  rule;
* every revision names a literal tuple, ``c4a4e7d1b9f2`` the row arm alone and
  the newest calling revision every arm the module knows, so a database built
  by the chain and one built from scratch (``scripts/init_database.py``,
  ``scripts/build_test_template.py``, which pass :data:`ALL_ARMS`) agree.

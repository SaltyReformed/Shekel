"""Tests for the audit-infrastructure rebuild migration (Commit C-13).

Covers:

  * Idempotency of :func:`app.audit_infrastructure.apply_audit_infrastructure`.
  * Round-trip of apply + remove + apply that simulates ``flask db
    upgrade`` -> ``flask db downgrade`` -> ``flask db upgrade``.
  * Provisioning of the ``shekel_app`` least-privilege role and the
    GRANT block inside the migration -- exercised by creating the
    role within the test, asserting the role can DML but not DDL,
    then dropping it.
  * The ``app.current_user_id`` session-variable capture path.
  * The trigger-count health check that ``entrypoint.sh`` runs.

The tests lean on the ``shekel_user`` test role being a PostgreSQL
superuser (which it is on this project's local dev/test config) so
the role-provisioning paths can run without a separate fixture
container.  Tests that need that capability assert it up front via
``ROLE_PROVISIONING_AVAILABLE`` so a future hardened test
environment skips them cleanly instead of failing.

# ``shekel_app`` PostgreSQL role created by the
# :func:`shekel_app_role` fixture cannot be safely concurrent with
# tests in OTHER classes of this same file -- specifically
# ``TestApplyIdempotent`` and ``TestRoundTrip`` invoke
# :func:`apply_audit_infrastructure`, whose ``_GRANT_APP_ROLE_SQL``
# block conditionally ``GRANT``s privileges to ``shekel_app`` WHEN
# the role exists.  If those tests ran on a different worker while
# ``TestLeastPrivilegeRole`` had the role alive, the GRANTs would
# leak into the OTHER worker's per-session database; the
# ``shekel_app_role`` fixture's teardown ``DROP OWNED BY`` only
# affects its own database, so the cross-database grants would
# block ``DROP ROLE`` with ``DependentObjectsStillExist`` errors.
# Pinning the entire module sidesteps that race; other test files
# continue to fan out across workers normally.

#: end up in a different cluster from the databases it is guarding.

#:
#: **``xdist_group`` above is not enough, and the gap is a whole class of
#: shared state the project's isolation knobs cannot reach** (measured
#: 2026-08-22).  That marker pins this module to one worker WITHIN a run.  A
#: PostgreSQL role is a CLUSTER object, so it is shared by every database on the
#: postmaster -- and ``TEST_DB_PREFIX``, which is how two checkouts isolate
#: themselves, renames DATABASES.  Two suites running side by side therefore
#: tear this role out from under each other whatever prefix they use.
#:
#: Reproduced deterministically: two prefixed runs of this one module in
#: parallel produce 2-4 setup ERRORS on each side, every one an
#: ``@shekel_app_role`` fixture.  In a full-suite run it surfaces as a single
#: unexplained ``ERROR`` that passes on re-run alone -- which reads exactly like
#: a code regression and cost a session an hour.  It reproduces identically on
#: commits either side of plan step X-az, so it is not that step's.
#:
#: **The role may not simply be renamed per process**, and that is why the lock
#: is the fix rather than a suffix: ``app.posting_infrastructure`` names
#: ``shekel_app`` as a LITERAL in the GRANT / REVOKE SQL the fixture itself runs
#: (``apply_ledger_append_only_privileges``), so a renamed role would make the
#: app's own posture SQL a silent no-op and every privilege assertion below
#: would grade nothing.  The resource is cluster-scoped, so the mutex has to be.

    """Take the cross-process lock guarding the ``shekel_app`` role.

    **On the ADMIN database, and that is the whole mechanism** (measured
    2026-08-22, twice).  Two earlier shapes did not work and each was wrong in
    an instructive way:

    * a lock taken through ``db.session`` is lost at the fixture's first
      ``commit()``, because a session-level advisory lock is held by a
      CONNECTION and the session returns its connection to the pool there;
    * a lock taken on the test's OWN database excludes nobody, because
      **PostgreSQL advisory locks are namespaced per DATABASE**.  Two suites
      isolated by ``TEST_DB_PREFIX`` sit in different databases by
      construction, so they take the same key in two different lock spaces and
      both win.

    The role is a CLUSTER object, so the mutex has to live somewhere every
    process on the postmaster shares.  ``TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL`` is that
    place -- it is the connection ``conftest`` already uses to create and drop
    each worker's database, so it is guaranteed reachable wherever the suite
    runs.  A dedicated connection held for the fixture's whole span makes the
    create-use-drop sequence atomic; closing it releases the lock, so no unlock
    statement can be skipped by an exception.

    **It polls with a deadline rather than blocking**, so a peer that holds the
    lock produces a sentence naming the cause instead of the suite's 30-second
    per-test timeout naming nothing.

class TestLedgerAppendOnlyPrivileges:
    """The posting ledger is append-only at the DATABASE tier for ``shekel_app``.

    The 2026-07-02 balance-architecture review demonstrated (M1) that a
    raw-SQL DELETE of one leg of a balanced entry silently breaks the trial
    balance: the deferred balanced trigger has no DELETE arm (CASCADE
    disposal would see a transient ``COUNT < 2``), its UPDATE arm checks only
    the NEW row's entry, and the ORM immutability guards do not fire for raw
    SQL.  R4 closes that surface with ``REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE`` on
    ``budget.journal_entries`` + ``budget.account_postings`` from the
    runtime role (``app.posting_infrastructure.
    apply_ledger_append_only_privileges``, applied by migration
    ``e3c23fadb21d``, ``init_database.py``, and re-asserted by
    ``init_db_role.sql`` on every container start).

    These tests exercise the posture through the :func:`shekel_app_role`
    fixture, which provisions the role exactly as ``init_db_role.sql`` does
    (blanket DML grant, then the targeted ledger revoke) -- so what is
    asserted here is the runtime posture, not a test-local approximation.
    The two disposal tests are load-bearing: PostgreSQL executes referential
    actions as the table OWNER, so tenancy CASCADE and source SET NULL must
    keep working for a role that cannot DELETE or UPDATE the ledger tables
    (verified live on the dev stack before this suite was authored).

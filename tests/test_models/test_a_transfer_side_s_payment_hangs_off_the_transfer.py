"""Migration ``e616adf7fe22``: a transfer side's payment hangs off the transfer.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``, rulings **R-BAL88** (two side links),
**R-BAL107** (a transfer's accounts are its owner's) and **R-BAL168** (the side
keys carry a record on an endpoint move).  The revision files every payment
record under a twin row under its TRANSFER by a side link, moving no figure,
day, account or link; it REFUSES, writing nothing, while any stored row could
not take its link; and its downgrade puts each record back under its side's
twin, refusing while a side has none or while a twin no longer says what its
transfer and its side's record say (the cp2b-1 review's L-4).

Driven against the test database, which is built at head, through the shipped
``upgrade`` / ``downgrade``.  **At head no transfer has a twin**: plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``'s revision, the one above (:data:`_STEP_ABOVE`),
deletes them and refuses a new one.  So every case that reads or plants a
twin, or downgrades this revision, first runs the step above's downgrade
(:func:`_twins_built`), as the release's own way down does: it builds two
twins for every transfer by its one build rule, each saying its transfer's
status and its side's record's day, basis and link.  This revision's
downgrade then files every record under its side's twin, which is the
pre-step shape its upgrade meets.  Between the two the ORM's models name
columns the table does not have, so that window is raw SQL only.  Every case
whose last act is an upgrade runs both upgrades and so ends at head; a case
that ends in a refusal ends where the refusal left it, on a database the
``db`` fixture clones for that case alone.

**A case whose premise is a settle or a ``$0.00`` close the app made AT this
revision builds the twins first and then drives that act through the app's
own status door**: from this revision that door writes the transfer and its
sides' records and never a twin, so the twins keep the status and the day
they were built with, which is what this revision's downgrade refuses.  Only
that act stands in this way: the head app's create door writes no twin where
the one at this revision wrote two, so a case needing another act made at
this revision would have to plant it.

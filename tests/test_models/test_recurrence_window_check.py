"""
Shekel Budget App -- a closing date never precedes the first occurrence (recurrence:R7d-g)

One fact on ``budget.recurrence_rules`` (finding **D35**, ruling **R-R80**,
migration ``bf50951a3599``)::

    ck_recurrence_rules_valid_window
        end_date IS NULL OR end_date >= starts_on

Drafted for plan step R7c-b and HELD BACK on a developer ruling (2026-08-15)
because the two columns then held two KINDS of fact -- what an owner authors,
and the derived payoff ten chokepoints wrote for a loan payment, where a loan
cleared before its first installment inverts the pair honestly.  R7d-g deleted
the writers, so every stored pair is an owner's word and both authoring doors
already refuse an inverted one; the constraint makes the state unrepresentable
rather than merely unproduced.

**Three classes.**  The CHECK itself, exercised in every direction a writer
could reach it from -- an INSERT with the pair inverted, an UPDATE moving the
stop below the start, an UPDATE moving the start past the stop -- and the two
accepted shapes on the boundary (equal dates; a count bound, which the CHECK
does not name).  Every row is built BARE, for the reason
``test_template_row_needs_due_date`` gives: the write door and the two form
refusals exist to make the refused states unreachable, so a control routed
through one would grade the door and never the constraint.

Then the MIGRATION, driven over this test's private clone: its ``upgrade``
NULLs exactly the rows ruling **R-R80** names -- the standing payment of a
configured loan and an ARCHIVED transfer into one -- and leaves a second
active transfer's owner-authored stop and a count bound alone; its
``downgrade`` drops the CHECK and restores nothing.  The refusal the upgrade
makes on a row step 1 does not clear is FIRED here rather than left as the
one path a green suite never runs: a second transfer's inverted pair (planted
with the CHECK down) fails the ``ALTER TABLE`` whole and the rollback takes
step 1's NULLs back with it.

"""The feed table refuses what no writer should be trusted to avoid.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-2``, ruling **bank_import:R-BI12**.  Migration
``b447279d7a2e`` lands ``budget.bank_feeds``: the owner's claimed SimpleFIN
access URL, as ciphertext under the field-encryption key.

**Every constraint test here is a FIRING CONTROL.**  The claim door (a later
commit of the same step) refuses each of these states before it writes, so
nothing in ordinary use reaches the database tier -- and a test that merely
asserted a constraint EXISTS would pass against one admitting everything.
Each writes the state through the ORM, flushes, and asserts the refusal BY
NAME, which is the only tier that can see a future writer bypassing the door.

The shapes under test, and what each would cost if writable:

* **two feeds for one owner** -- two access URLs, so "the owner's feed" has
  two answers and the nightly door syncs one owner twice;
* **a feed holding no URL** -- a row that is not a feed, which the disconnect
  door would have to distinguish from one that is;
* **a feed surviving its owner** -- the CASCADE, asserted in the other
  direction: the state is unreachable because the database removes the row.

It also pins the audit registration and what the audit copy CARRIES: the
trigger writes the whole row, ciphertext included, as it does for
``auth.mfa_configs`` -- the exposure class ruling R-BI12 accepts -- so a
disconnect leaves the ciphertext readable under the key in ``system.audit_log``
until retention removes it.  That is stated by a test rather than assumed,
because the disconnect sentence ("revoke at Bridge") rests on it.

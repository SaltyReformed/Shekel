"""The cutover to the per-raise end year -- plan step **salary:S3-c**.

The second half of ruling **R-SAL11**: plan step salary:S3-b added
``salary.salary_raises.terminal_year`` and wrote no value; this step carries
each owner's ``auth.user_settings.merit_raise_horizon_years`` onto their raise
rows, deletes that setting, and deletes the in-memory fabrication
(``pension_calculator._terminate_after_horizon``) that would otherwise
overwrite the stored value on every ``/retirement`` render.

**The BACKFILL is the money and it is EXECUTED here, not inspected.**  A
migration's raw SQL is the one part a recorder cannot grade: the recorder sees
that an ``execute`` happened and nothing about what it did.  So
:class:`TestTheBackfillCarriesEachOwnersHorizon` restores the dropped column
into the test's own database, seeds the shapes the statement discriminates
between, RUNS the migration module's own ``_BACKFILL`` text, and reads the
rows back.  DDL is safe to do here because ``conftest``'s ``db`` fixture
clones a database per test and drops it afterwards, so the ``ACCESS
EXCLUSIVE`` lock this takes is on a database nothing else can see.  *Plan step
salary:S3-b's own migration class states the opposite rule and is still right
for what it does: it drives ``upgrade``/``downgrade`` through a recorder
because those are pure DDL, and DDL is what the recorder can grade
completely.*

The backfill's cases are its clauses, one test each, because a statement
that is right about all but one of them silently moves money on that one.

:class:`TestTheGlobalSettingIsGone` reads the live catalog rather than the
model, for the reason ``test_c25_column_invariants`` exists: a model and a
migration drift apart silently, and this one is a DROP, so the direction that
matters is a column that survived the migration.

:class:`TestARaiseStopsBadgingAfterItsEndYear` covers the obligation this step
INHERITED from salary:S3-a rather than created -- ``get_raise_event`` walks
the same rows to badge a raise on the salary surfaces and knew nothing about
termination, so it went on announcing a raise every year after the field had
already stopped moving the gross.

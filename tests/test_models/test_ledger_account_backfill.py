"""Tests for the b82538084d24 ledger-accounts migration backfill.

Build-Order Step 2, Commit 2
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/implementation_plan_posting_ledger_transfers.md``).
The migration creates ``budget.ledger_accounts`` then backfills one linked
ledger account for every existing real account, deriving the ledger class
from the account-type category.

The migration is already at HEAD when these tests run (the template
builder upgraded it base->head against an EMPTY ``budget.accounts`` table,
so the in-chain backfill was a no-op).  Each test therefore sets up a new
account, removes the ledger account the go-forward sync hook auto-created,
then invokes the migration's idempotent backfill SQL directly to assert the
deterministic mapping from account-type category to ledger class -- exactly
the pattern the ``loan_anchor_events`` backfill test
(``tests/test_models/test_loan_anchor_backfill.py``) uses.

**Post-Step-4 adaptation (``kind_id``).**  Step 4, Commit 2
(``efca4315bf81``) added a NOT NULL ``ledger_accounts.kind_id`` discriminator,
so the frozen b82 INSERT -- which predates that column and omits it -- can no
longer run standalone at HEAD.  In production the chain ran the b82 INSERT at
its own revision (before ``kind_id`` existed) and the Step-4 migration then
backfilled ``kind_id = 'linked'`` for every ``account_id``-bearing row; at
HEAD those two are fused because ``kind_id`` is already NOT NULL.
:func:`_head_valid_backfill_sql` reproduces exactly that fusion -- it reuses
the frozen (immutable, shipped) b82 mapping SQL as the single source of the
category -> class derivation and injects only the linked-kind value the Step-4
backfill would assign.  The category-mapping assertions below are unchanged;
they still execute the b82 derivation, now against the post-Step-4 schema.

A full executable upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade round-trip belongs in the
Alembic-driven environment, not an in-test xdist worker (a ``DROP TABLE``
needs an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock that conflicts with the session-scoped
``ref_cache`` refresh's ACCESS SHARE locks).  The downgrade is checked at
source level here; the executable round-trip was run manually against the
prod-clone dev DB during development (downgrade dropped the table and its
trigger; re-upgrade regenerated all 10 backfilled rows, 8 Asset / 2
Liability).

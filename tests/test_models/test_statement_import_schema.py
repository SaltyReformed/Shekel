"""The statement tables refuse what no writer should be trusted to avoid.

Plan step **bank_import:X-f6a-1**, ruling **R-FP**.  Migration
``3f408018a71c`` lands four tables whose whole job is to hold a record the app
did not author, and the constraints below are what make that record trustworthy
independently of the import door.

**Every test here is a FIRING CONTROL** (``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard
4).  The door already refuses each of these states in Python, so nothing in
ordinary use reaches the database tier -- and a test that merely asserted a
constraint EXISTS would pass against one that admitted everything.  Each test
writes the state through the ORM, flushes, and asserts the refusal BY NAME, which
is the only tier that can see a future writer bypassing the door.

The shapes under test, and what each would cost if writable:

* **a duplicated line identity** -- the same bank line recorded twice, which is
  double-counted money the moment the next leaf matches it;
* **a sighting whose account disagrees with its line's or its import's** --
  one bank's statement filed under another account, the defect the two
  composite keys exist to prevent (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-1``: a line
  is held by the SIGHTINGS of the imports that showed it, and what a source
  said about a line is the sighting's);
* **a line no sighting holds** -- unrepresentable rather than merely
  unlikely, because the last sighting takes its line with it;
* **the CHECKs** on the declared window and the ordinal, each of which encodes
  a sentence the door states in Python and the schema must state
  independently.  *The two CHECKs on the stored counts went with the counts*
  (ruling **R-IY**), and the external-id uniqueness went to the door
  (``_record._refuse_moved_ids``, graded in ``test_record``).

"""Tests for the C-41 / F-069 migration ``a80c3447c153``.

The migration creates the partial unique index
``budget.uq_scenarios_one_baseline`` on the production database (it
was already present on the test-template path via the c5d6e7f8a901
upgrade and on the ``db.create_all()`` path via the Scenario model
declaration, but production was bootstrapped before either of those
paths carried the index -- see F-069 / H-2 in
``docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/model-migration-drift.md``).

These tests exercise four invariants of the migration:

  1. **Idempotency.**  Running the upgrade against a database that
     already carries a correctly-shaped index is a no-op.  The
     test-template path lands every per-worker DB in exactly that
     state, so the assertion confirms the test suite itself does not
     trip the migration on every session start.
  2. **Recreate-on-missing.**  Dropping the index and re-running the
     upgrade restores it with the canonical UNIQUE, partial WHERE
     ``is_baseline = ...`` shape.
  3. **Pre-flight refusal on dirty data.**  Inserting a second
     baseline scenario for the same user and running the upgrade
     raises ``RuntimeError`` whose message names every offender
     (user_id, scenario ids, scenario names, created_at values) and
     the manual remediation SQL.  The migration MUST refuse rather
     than auto-resolving because picking the "winning" baseline is a
     financial decision the operator must make.
  4. **Downgrade halts.**  Calling ``downgrade()`` raises
     ``NotImplementedError`` with the manual recovery SQL embedded;
     a ``flask db downgrade`` chain stops here rather than continuing
     past a half-reverted step.

Two additional defensive tests guard the post-creation shape check:

  5. **Shape check rejects a malformed index.**  If the index name
     is present but the definition is missing the UNIQUE keyword or
     the partial WHERE clause, ``_assert_index_shape`` refuses with
     an actionable RuntimeError.
  6. **Multi-user partial index preserves per-user scope.**  After
     recreation, two distinct users may each carry exactly one
     baseline scenario simultaneously -- the partial index is
     keyed on ``user_id``, not globally unique on ``is_baseline``.

Tests bootstrap an Alembic ``MigrationContext`` against the test
session's connection so the migration's ``op.create_index`` and the
``op.get_bind`` proxy resolve to real DDL through Alembic's
Operations proxy.  This mirrors the test-c19 round-trip pattern.

# pylint: disable=too-many-arguments,too-many-positional-arguments
# Rationale: ``redefined-outer-name`` is the canonical pytest fixture
# pattern; tests in this file declare local fixtures and consume them
# under the same names.  ``unused-argument`` is unavoidable for the
# ``restore_baseline_index`` fixture, which yields nothing and is
# requested purely so its teardown reaches the test's cleanup phase
# even on failure.  ``too-many-arguments`` / ``too-many-positional-
# arguments`` fire on the multi-user integration tests that need
# four conftest fixtures plus the local restore fixture; the
# threshold is below pytest's standard fixture footprint.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transaction flag-resolution property tests

Unit tests for ``Transaction.tracks_purchases`` and
``Transaction.visible_to_companion``.  Resolution rule: a row's two flags
are its DEFINITION's (the definition is the single source of truth for
every row it generates or places), and a row that names no definition -- a
transfer shadow, a CC payback -- answers ``False`` (ruling **R-BAL73**).
These properties are the load-bearing abstraction behind F2 (companion
visibility) and F3 (purchase tracking).

**The row carries no flag of its own** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-7d-2``,
ruling **R-BAL20**).  Until that cutover a LEGACY link-less row stated both
flags in two cells of its own, sealed at ``balance:X-bi-1`` / ``X-bi-1b`` so
the dead half on a generated row could not be read (keying on it read 4
envelopes where there are 238); the cutover minted every such row a
rule-less definition carrying its flags and dropped both columns, so the
public names ``is_envelope`` / ``companion_visible`` that read the accessor
and wrote the cell are gone from the row too.
:class:`TestTheRowCarriesNoFlag` pins what that means; the derived flags'
class-level names still refuse to key a query rather than silently matching
nothing.

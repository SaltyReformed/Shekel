"""Tests for the db239773c2fd historical settled-transfer backfill (Commit 3).

The Commit-3 migration creates the ledger tables and then backfills one
balanced journal entry per historical settled, non-deleted transfer.  The
migration is already at HEAD when these tests run (the template builder
upgraded base->head against an EMPTY ``budget.transfers`` table, so the
in-chain backfill was a no-op).  Each test therefore engineers a transfer
through ``transfer_service`` (the sole writer, so the shadows are real) and
invokes the migration's idempotent
:func:`_backfill_settled_transfers` directly -- the same pattern the
``ledger_accounts`` / ``loan_anchor_events`` backfill tests use.

Since Commit 5 wires the transfer service to auto-post on settle, each
settled-transfer test first clears those go-forward postings (raw SQL, via the
shared ``clear_postings_for_transfer`` helper -- the ORM blocks deletes on the
append-only tables) to reproduce the pre-ledger historical state the backfill
targets; otherwise the backfill's ``NOT EXISTS`` guard would no-op and the test
would assert on the auto-posted entry instead of the backfilled one.

**THE EXECUTABLE HALF OF THIS SUITE WAS DELETED AT PLAN STEP X-f1** (developer
ruling, 2026-08-03), and what survives is the revision pair and the
source-level downgrade check.  The ten deleted tests drove
``_backfill_settled_transfers``'s frozen raw SQL, which reads
``sf.paid_at`` -- a column migration ``a3f7c8e21b64`` DROPS.  They graded these
invariants: one balanced entry per settled transfer (asset->asset and
asset->liability), the leg amount taken from the shadow's ``effective_amount``,
the entry date derived from the shadow's ``paid_at``, the four exclusions
(Projected / Cancelled / soft-deleted / zero-effective), and idempotency.

**The path they graded is unreachable with data, permanently, and that is why
they went rather than being fed a resurrected column.**  This migration runs at
its OWN point in the chain, long before the drop, so a real ``base -> head``
upgrade is unaffected -- but it runs there over an EMPTY ``budget.transfers``,
and on any database already past it it never runs again.  ``a3f7c8e21b64``'s
downgrade REFUSES, so Alembic cannot rewind past the drop either.  Keeping them
runnable would have meant a per-revision template fixture that this suite does
not have -- ``alembic upgrade base -> <that revision>`` gives exactly the
application's schema at that point and is not blocked, so the honest statement is
that the harness has no such fixture, NOT that the schema could not be
reproduced.  (An earlier draft said the latter; a neutral review corrected it.)

**One of the deleted ten was NOT redundant, and naming it is the point.**  The
zero-effective-transfer exclusion has no survivor anywhere.  Nor do the
``TestBackfillAndGoForwardAgree`` cases deleted from the two live reconciliation
oracles in the same pass: the two surviving "backfill == go-forward" tests
(``test_posting_ledger_account_backfill.py``, ``test_loan_posting_backfill.py``)
reuse the go-forward builder, so they are true by construction rather than an
independent second opinion.  The ledger these entries built is graded instead by the live
reconciliation oracles (``tests/test_integration/test_posting_ledger_*.py``),
which assert the stronger property: that the posted ledger reconciles to the
source rows, whatever wrote it.

The executable migration up/down round-trip was verified manually against the
prod-clone dev DB during development (downgrade dropped both tables, the
balanced trigger, and its function; re-upgrade regenerated 13 balanced
entries / 26 legs reconciling to the settled-transfer shadows); the downgrade
is checked at source level here, matching the ``ledger_accounts`` backfill
suite's rationale (a ``DROP TABLE`` needs an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock that
conflicts with the session-scoped ``ref_cache`` refresh in an xdist worker).

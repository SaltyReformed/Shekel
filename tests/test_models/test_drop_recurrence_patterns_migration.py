"""Tests for the b2e9a47c3f18 "drop the closed pattern set's table" migration.

Plan step **R9** of ``docs/plans/implementation_plan_recurrence_redesign.md``
section 4 -- the last artefact of the closed pattern set.  The revision drops
``ref.recurrence_patterns``; the same commit deletes ``RecurrencePatternEnum``,
``ref_cache.recurrence_pattern_id`` and the ``app/ref_seeds.py`` entry.

Three subjects, and none of them re-runs the migration:

* **State at HEAD.**  The template builder upgraded base->head before these
  run, so "the table is gone" is asserted against the live catalogue.
* **The DROP is un-CASCADEd**, read from the AST.  That is the whole
  precondition of this step -- no inbound foreign key -- made structural: a
  plain ``DROP TABLE`` is refused by PostgreSQL while any FK depends on it, so
  the revision needs no hand-written guard and must not grow one that reaches
  for ``CASCADE``.
* **The downgrade is EXECUTED**, and it restores what the NEXT downgrade
  reads: ``d9f5c1a48b73`` is one step further down and its own downgrade
  re-seats every rule with
  ``SELECT id FROM ref.recurrence_patterns WHERE name = :pattern_name``, so
  this revision's reseed must carry every name that statement can look up.
  Graded against ``d9f5c1a48b73._PATTERN_BY_READING`` itself rather than
  against a list written here, which would be the second copy that drifts.

**Running the downgrade for real costs nothing, and an earlier draft of this
file said otherwise.**  It claimed DDL here would take locks against every
other xdist worker's database; the ``db`` fixture re-clones THIS worker's own
database for every test, so the CREATE reaches nobody else and survives no
other case.  Only the UPGRADE stays source-read, and for a different reason:
dropping the table would take it out from under the rest of the case.

**Three negative controls were driven against the real migration**, 2026-08-17,
because a downgrade test that has never been shown failing is a downgrade
nobody has checked:

* delete ``('Once')`` from the reseed -> three cases red
  (``..._the_whole_table_and_no_more``, ``..._the_retired_row_too``,
  ``..._reseed_really_is_idempotent``);
* delete ``ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING`` -> exactly ONE case red, the
  idempotence one, which is what says that case grades the clause rather than
  the string;
* widen ``sa.String(length=20)`` to 40 -> exactly one case red, the shape one.

**What is still development-time evidence** is the round trip against real
data, recorded on the plan step: a production clone upgraded (8 rows -> table
absent), downgraded (table back, 8 rows), downgraded once further past
``d9f5c1a48b73`` (0 of 46 rules left with a NULL ``pattern_id``), and
re-upgraded.

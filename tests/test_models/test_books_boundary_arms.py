"""The books boundary is built ARM BY ARM, and a revision declares its own.

Plan step **balance:X-f3c-2b-2b**.  These cases exist because the shared
builders in :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` are imported LIVE from ``app/``
by migrations that shipped long before the arms they now install.  Nothing
stopped the module's growth reaching backwards, and it was measured doing
exactly that: with the matched-line arm added and ``d3b6f1c8a274`` still
calling the builder unqualified, that revision installed
``ck_matched_line_after_books_open`` and ``ck_line_day_after_books_open`` five
revisions before ``d1f6a83c9e47`` runs the census that decides whether the rows
already there can satisfy them.  Observed on a clone of the developer's
database stopped at ``c9f4b1e78d02``, which came up carrying both triggers
LIVE.  A constraint installed ahead
of its census is what finding **N-400** is made of, reached from the migration
side.

Three properties are pinned here, and the first two are what let the third
exist:

* the builders take an explicit ``arms`` set and install exactly it;
* the statement is TOTAL rather than additive -- an arm the caller does not
  name is dropped, triggers first and then functions;
* so ``d1f6a83c9e47``'s downgrade is one call naming one fewer arm, and keeps
  NO frozen copy of the previous function bodies.  The copy it used to keep
  was correct when written and pinned by nothing; the next edit to any of the
  three bodies would have rotted it silently.

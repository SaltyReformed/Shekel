"""Migration ``ef32dfe4cd8e`` -- a rule admits at most N occurrences a month.

Plan step **salary:R15-a** (ruling **R-SAL29**).  The migration adds
``budget.recurrence_rules.max_per_month`` with its floor CHECK, and its
downgrade REFUSES while any row carries a ceiling: dropping the column would
turn "every paycheck, at most 2 a month" into "every paycheck", which on the
developer's eleven payroll lines is ``$1,034.42`` a year of deductions the
employer does not take.  Both directions are driven through the migration's
own shipped callables, never through hand-written DDL standing in for them,
and every assertion reads the DATABASE for the objects.

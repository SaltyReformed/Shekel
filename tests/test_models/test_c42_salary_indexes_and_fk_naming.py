"""Tests for the C-42 migration ``c42b1d9a4e8f``.

The migration restores three salary-schema indexes dropped by
22b3dd9d9ed3 (F-071 / F-079), creates four missing FK-column indexes
(F-139 / F-140), and renames three FK constraints to the project's
``fk_*`` convention (F-072 / F-137 / F-138).  See the migration's
module docstring for the full per-finding rationale.

The test suite exercises five invariants:

  1. **Post-upgrade DB shape.**  Every index named in
     ``INDEX_SPECS`` exists in ``pg_indexes`` after the per-worker
     test-template clone (which carries the migration chain run to
     head).  Every FK in ``FK_RENAME_SPECS`` carries its new name
     and not its old name.
  2. **Idempotency.**  Running ``upgrade()`` against an already-
     migrated DB is a strict no-op (no DDL issued, no DB error,
     every index still present, every FK still under the new name).
  3. **Recreate-on-missing.**  Dropping an index and re-running the
     upgrade restores it with the same shape.  Renaming a FK back
     to its legacy name and re-running the upgrade restores the new
     name.
  4. **DESC ordering preserved.**  The composite
     ``idx_rate_history_account`` index encodes the
     ``effective_date DESC`` sort direction; the post-creation shape
     check refuses to accept an ascending recreation.
  5. **Downgrade round-trip.**  ``downgrade()`` reverses every
     change symmetrically: indexes dropped, FK names restored to
     the pre-C-42 ``<table>_<column>_fkey`` form.  A second
     ``upgrade()`` after the downgrade leaves the DB in the same
     post-upgrade state as the first.

Two additional defensive tests guard the helper invariants:

  6. **Helper return-value contract.**
     ``_create_index_if_missing`` returns True on real DDL, False on
     no-op.  ``_rename_constraint_if_legacy`` does the same.
  7. **Post-rename shape check.**  The migration refuses to silently
     succeed against a DB where the FK was dropped out-of-band
     between the existence check and the rename DDL (verified by
     calling the helper against an explicitly-stripped table).

Tests bootstrap an Alembic ``MigrationContext`` against the test
session's connection so the migration's ``op.create_index`` and the
``op.get_bind`` proxy resolve to real DDL through Alembic's
Operations proxy.  This mirrors the test-c41 round-trip pattern.

# pylint: disable=redefined-outer-name,unused-argument
# pylint: disable=protected-access
# Rationale: ``redefined-outer-name`` is the canonical pytest fixture
# pattern; tests in this file declare local fixtures and consume them
# under the same names.  ``unused-argument`` is unavoidable for
# fixture-only requests like ``seed_user`` that ensure conftest
# fixtures have produced a populated DB but whose return values the
# assertion does not depend on.  ``protected-access`` is required to
# call the migration's helper functions (prefixed with a leading
# underscore by convention to mark them as private to the migration
# module); the tests exercise these directly to assert their return-
# value contracts.

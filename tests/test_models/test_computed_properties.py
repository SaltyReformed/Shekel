        it to read the expense side, a pair that had somehow diverged would
        render one day on the form and file the postings under another.  The
        divergence is forced here (bypassing the service, which is what keeps
        the pair equal) precisely because the two rows are otherwise identical
        and the choice would be untestable.

        **The unfalsifiable version of this test was fixed in the CODE, not
        here, and that is the point worth keeping.**  The property used to
        iterate the ``shadow_transactions`` backref, which declares no
        ``order_by`` -- so "reads the income shadow" and "reads whichever row
        the unordered SELECT returned first" were indistinguishable, and a
        POSITIONAL implementation is right half the time.  A neutral review
        planted a last-row read and it survived; a second, swapped-days control
        written against it survived too, because a positional read that happens
        to land on the income row lands there in both arrangements.  No test
        over a two-row pair can separate them.

        The property now names the row in SQL (``account_id ==
        to_account_id``), so position is not expressible and the only mutation
        left is naming the WRONG account -- which this test kills in both
        arrangements.  The days are still swapped and the property still asked
        twice, because that is what proves the answer tracks the ACCOUNT rather

    """The COLUMN refuses a ``datetime``, on every ORM write path (N-179).

    ``datetime`` subclasses ``date``, so the type annotation catches nothing and
    the value reaches PostgreSQL, which coerces it into the ``DATE`` column on
    the SESSION clock -- UTC.  An instant at 2026-03-04 04:30 UTC is
    2026-03-03 23:30 Eastern, so the row would store 2026-03-04: one day late,
    silently, which is the split ruling R-DH (b) exists to delete.

    **These pin the VALIDATOR, and they exist because nothing did.**  The seam
    calls :func:`~app.models.transaction.reject_settle_instant` itself, ahead of
    any assignment, so ``test_status_seam.py``'s refusal test proves the SEAM
    and cannot reach the column hook at all -- it asserts the row was left
    untouched, i.e. that the assignment never ran.  Deleting the ``@validates``
    decorator therefore regressed nothing detectable, which is finding N-182's
    own shape (a guarantee with no pin) inside the fix for N-179.  The hook is
    what makes the claim "the column simply does not accept the type" true of a
    future fixture or service that writes the attribute directly.

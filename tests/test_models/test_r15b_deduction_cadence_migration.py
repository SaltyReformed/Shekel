"""Migration ``542c61e48ee8`` -- a payroll deduction's cadence is a recurrence rule.

Plan step **salary:R15-b** (rulings **R-SAL3**, **R-SAL29**, **R-SAL30**,
**R-SAL32**).  The migration adds the third arm of ``budget.recurrence_rules``'
owning arc, writes one rule per 24 / 12 line in the two shapes its docstring
spells, and drops ``salary.paycheck_deductions.deductions_per_year``; its
downgrade rebuilds the column from those two shapes and REFUSES any other
deduction-owned shape, because writing 26 for a line the owner said is
monthly moves money.  Both directions are driven through the migration's own
shipped callables, and every assertion reads the DATABASE for the objects --
and, for the rewrite, prices the migrated line through the engine against
the ordinal rule it replaced, which is the byte-identical claim in miniature.

**Every case that drives this revision's callables runs them under plan step
``salary:R18-a``'s downgrade** (:func:`~tests._test_helpers
.rewind_paycheck_lines_rename`, Alembic's newest-first order): head renamed
``salary.paycheck_deductions`` and the arm's column (ruling **R-SAL38**), so
the statements here find the schema they were written against only once the
later revision is undone -- and its upgrade is replayed before a line is read
back through the models this tree maps.  The one case that reads HEAD's
schema names the head objects.

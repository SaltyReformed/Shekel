"""Migration ``cddb15ffba5f`` -- a mis-dated loan statement is withdrawn (plan step ``recurrence:R23``).

Both directions are driven through the migration's own shipped callables over
a world holding every shape the predicate must tell apart, each built the way
the migration that wrote the copies left it: ``d3d25212504b`` inserted a legacy
``origination`` row and a ``user_trueup`` copy in ONE transaction, so the two
share a ``created_at``, and the copy is dated that migration's run day.

* ``copied`` -- the defect: the copy is the loan's earliest statement, dated
  after the setup day, and the owner recorded a statement of their own AFTER
  it.  Selected.
* ``owner_first`` -- the same copy, but the owner recorded a ``tracking_start``
  BEFORE it.  Excluded: the stated balance is on record already.
* ``no_signature`` -- a ``user_trueup`` on the same days whose instant is its
  own.  Excluded: nothing says a migration copied it.
* ``copy_on_setup_day`` -- a copy dated the setup day itself.  Excluded:
  nothing to move.
* ``set_up_at_origination`` -- a loan originated on its setup day.  Excluded:
  its origination is its assertion.
* ``tracking_start_copy`` -- a ``tracking_start`` sharing the origination
  row's instant.  Excluded: only a ``user_trueup`` was ever copied.

Every clause of the predicate has a shape that fails only it, so a predicate
missing any one clause selects a second row and the first case fails.  The
round trip grades ruling **R-R99**: the downgrade deletes ONLY the statement the
upgrade recorded, the audit log keeps it, and a second upgrade selects the same
copy again.  Every assertion reads the DATABASE.  Figures are made up.

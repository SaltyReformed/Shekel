"""A movement's figure names its source: the column and the backfill's arms.

Plan step **balance:X-bi-3a**, ruling **R-BAL39**.  ``transaction_entries.
figure_source_id`` says WHO WROTE a movement's figure -- the settle pricing it
from the plan (``resolved``), a person (``typed``) or the bank's own line
(``observed``) -- NOT NULL with no default, because both writers of a movement
state it and a stored guess is the shape ruling R-IY deletes.

**The backfill's arms are DRIVEN, not described** (the pattern
``test_settle_day_basis`` set for the day's catalogue, after a review showed a
test over a docstring grades a docstring).  The migration classifies by the
purchase's OWN day basis and never by its parent: a purchase the bank observed
carries the bank's figure, every other one a person's.  Each case below stages
rows in the pre-backfill state -- dated or not, with NO source -- runs
``classify_figure_sources`` against the test connection, and reads the
classification back by NAME.  The NOT NULL is dropped for the duration of each
case because the state a backfill classifies is exactly the intermediate the
migration itself creates before it adds it; DDL is transactional in
PostgreSQL, so the rollback each case ends with restores it.

"""The R7c-b migration's PRE-FLIGHT guards, each shown to fire.

Plan step **R7c-b** (migration ``b6d41f0a9c27``) tightens four columns to
``NOT NULL``, completes ``ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day`` with its clamp
equality, and adds ``ck_recurrence_rules_starts_on_range``.  Before each piece
of DDL it runs a Python guard that NAMES the rows the constraint would refuse,
because ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD CHECK`` reports the table and the constraint and
not the row: an operator meeting it mid-deploy would have a failed migration
and no way to see which rule to repair.

**Each guard grades a state the application cannot reach**, so it can never
fire in the suite by accident -- which is exactly why each is driven here,
with a control that shows it does NOT fire on healthy data
(``docs/plans/verification.md`` standard 4).

What this file covered until plan step R7c-c
---------------------------------------------

It graded the BACKFILL those two migrations share -- the SQL in
:mod:`migrations._recurrence_two_axis_backfill`, which derived the two-axis
columns from the closed-set ones -- against the write door as an independent
Python producer, over a matrix of schedules, cadences, clamp days and cycle
months, with a poison step as the firing control.

That grading is retired with the columns it read.  ``pattern_id``,
``day_of_month``, ``month_of_year``, ``start_date`` and ``start_period_id`` are
DROPPED (migration ``d9f5c1a48b73``), so the statement cannot be executed
against a database at head at all: not "it passes trivially", which would be
the free pass ``verification.md`` standard 3 warns about, but that it raises
``UndefinedColumn`` before reaching an assertion.

**The migrations themselves are unaffected and still exercised.**  Alembic runs
them at their own point in the chain, before the drop, on every build of the
test template -- and the evidence for what they did is in ``370a30cc`` and
``900e761a``, whose commit messages carry the measured matrix.  A migration is
graded where it executes; grading it against a schema three revisions ahead
would fail it for a change it cannot see.

Clock discipline (``.claude/rules/testing.md``): every date here is a literal.

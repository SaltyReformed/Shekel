"""Tests for the d9f5c1a48b73 "the closed pattern set dies" migration.

Plan step **R7c-c**, the CONTRACT half of the recurrence redesign's expand /
migrate / contract: it re-points ``interval_n`` off the closed-set encoding and
drops ``pattern_id``, ``day_of_month``, ``month_of_year``, ``start_date``,
``start_period_id``, ``offset_periods`` and the empty
``budget.recurrence_month_anchors``.

**What this file grades is the migration's two REFUSALS and the mapping they
share**, which nothing executed when the step was built -- against the standard
the migration's own docstring sets for them ("a refusal nothing executes is a
refusal nobody has seen work").  Both were driven by hand during an adversarial
review and both fired correctly; this is that drive made repeatable.

Three subjects, and none of them re-runs the migration:

* :func:`_pattern_for`, the closed set's INVERSE -- pure, and the piece a later
  edit gets wrong silently, because its exact-match-then-fallback ORDER is what
  decides whether ``(1, period)`` comes back as ``Every Period`` or as
  ``Every N Periods``.  Both resolve identically, so no behavioural test
  downstream can tell them apart, and only the named one round-trips.
* :func:`refuse_unencodable_cadences`, the downgrade's guard.  Driven against
  the live database, which needs NO DDL: it reads only columns that survive at
  head.
* the SQL spelling of the scheduling day, graded against the Python one over
  planted rules.  The migration's claim is that ``_authoring._author``'s
  expression, ``recurrence.scheduling_day_of_month`` and this SQL are the SAME
  rule; the equality was measured on a production clone and never asserted.

The upgrade's own refusal, :func:`refuse_unequal_scheduling_day`, is not driven
end to end here: its WHERE clause reads ``day_of_month``, which this revision
drops, so executing it at head would need the column back and DDL inside an
xdist worker takes locks on a database every other worker shares.  What that
refusal actually asks -- "does the SQL derivation equal the Python one" -- is
:class:`TestTheSqlDerivationIsThePythonOne` below, over the cases the two could
disagree on.  That is the half a future edit can break; the ``IS DISTINCT FROM``
comparison around it cannot drift on its own.

What R7c-c RETIRED, and why that is not a coverage regression
-------------------------------------------------------------

Two migration-grading files lost their subject to this revision's drops, and
both losses are stated rather than left to be noticed:

* ``tests/test_models/test_recurrence_start_bound_fold.py`` is DELETED (276
  lines).  It graded migration ``c4e1a8b70f36``'s fold -- plan step R7b-4's
  collapse of ``start_period_id`` plus ``start_date`` into the date alone --
  by running that revision's own SQL text over five planted shapes, the
  complete space of its predicate, with the last two as firing controls.  Both
  columns it reads are dropped here, so the statement raises ``UndefinedColumn``
  against a database at head before it can reach an assertion.  Not "it passes
  trivially", which would be the free pass ``docs/plans/verification.md``
  standard 3 warns about -- it cannot run at all.
* ``tests/test_models/test_recurrence_two_axis_backfill.py`` kept its file and
  lost its backfill half, for the same reason and with the same statement in
  its own docstring.

**The migrations themselves are unaffected and still exercised.**  Alembic runs
each at its own point in the chain, before the drop, on every build of the test
template; the evidence for what they did is in ``c4e1a8b70f36``'s commit and in
``370a30cc`` / ``900e761a``, whose messages carry the measured matrices.  A
migration is graded where it executes, and grading one against a schema
revisions ahead of it fails it for a change it cannot see.

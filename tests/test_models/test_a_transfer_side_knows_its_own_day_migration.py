"""Migration ``d3b8f5a1c7e2``: a transfer side knows its own day.

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``, rulings **R-BAL143** (relabel, by
predicate) and **R-BAL165** (a pre-step typed day stays typed on both sides).
The revision seeds ``ref.settled_day_bases.borrowed`` and relabels every
transfer side whose basis its writer did not earn -- on the shadow and its
covering movement together -- and REFUSES a relabel the day function would
never produce.  No day, figure or link moves.

Driven against the test database, which is built at head, through the
revision's own module-level pieces: :func:`classify_sides` grades each arm of
the predicate on the states the doors below plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` wrote (with the audit rows the database's triggers
write for them), :func:`refuse_unborrowable` fires on a side whose day is not
its sibling's, and the whole ``upgrade`` / ``downgrade`` pair is run over the
pre-step shapes, which the downgrade must restore exactly.

**Every settled pre-step pair is planted by SQL** since that step, which files
a transfer side's record under the TRANSFER and stops writing a twin's
status, day, basis and statement link -- so no door at head writes the shape
this revision reads (the twins settled, each holding a covering movement).
Each state is written as the pre-step doors wrote it: the parent's status,
each twin's status, day and basis in ONE UPDATE (the audit row the stamp arm
reads), a movement under each twin mirroring it, a correction writing twin and
movement together, and a tick linking both.  Setup only, approved by the
developer 2026-10-08 (rule 5, ruling **balance:R-BAL234**): no arm, basis or
day a case checks changed.  Until that step the service wrote these states.

**Two arms are told apart by a further plant**: the test database's writes
and the migration run as ONE role, so every write onto a settled dateless row
reads as the backfill's (``entered_guess``) until its audit row's ``db_user``
is re-labelled; and a statement member that existed and was later removed is
planted as the audit INSERT the member's trigger would have written.

    owner's companion a HIDDEN row (``not txn.visible_to_companion``,
    ``test_a_companions_probe``) and another household's companion a companion-VISIBLE row
    (its ``owner_id != acts_on``, ``test_a_companions_probe_of_another_household``).
    The door asks the not-found predicate
    (``is_not_found_to_transaction_doors``) AFTER both access branches, and its
    comment says why: every such probe is an access denial first (``access_denied_cross_user``
    at WARNING, the F-144 contract) and "not found" second, so the predicate never runs
    and logs nothing.  Measured at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` (ruling **R-BAL300**):
    evaluating the predicate ahead of the access branches, every return unchanged, logged
    the row as ``resource_not_found`` before the denial and failed no test that captures a
    log, for either requester (for the companion, at the deletion's parent too).  These
    cases are that grade.  Moving the whole block ahead also hands the requester the row's
    NAME: every case fails on that too, and ``TestNothingLeaksThroughTheName``
    (``tests/test_routes/test_cc5_4a4_hidden_row_doors.py``) grades the name at every
    surface.

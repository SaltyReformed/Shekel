"""Tests for the centralized monetary rounding boundary (E-26, HIGH-04).

The audit (08_findings.md HIGH-04) identified 24 bare
``.quantize(Decimal("0.01"))`` sites in ``app/`` that silently fall back
to Python's default ``ROUND_HALF_EVEN`` (banker's), against the
``ROUND_HALF_UP`` convention every hand-computed financial test in this
project assumes. ``app/utils/money.py`` introduces the single boundary
helper E-26 requires. This file pins the helper's behavior at the
boundaries that matter:

- The half-up / banker's divergence at the ``Decimal("2.345")`` boundary
  (the canonical case where the two rounding modes produce different
  cents: half-up -> 2.35, banker's -> 2.34).
- Negative-number half-up semantics (away from zero on ties).
- Long-precision inputs typical of pre-quantize loan/interest math.
- ``ROUND_CEILING`` sanctioned variant for the savings-goal case (named
  at the call site to make the deviation from default rounding
  explicit).
- ``TypeError`` on ``float`` so callers cannot bypass the Decimal
  contract by accident.

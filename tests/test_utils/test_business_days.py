"""Tests for the shared business-day calendar (plan step ``pay_calendar:C14-a``).

The module is one of the few in this application whose answer can be
checked against a published external record, and this file does exactly
that rather than re-deriving it.  **Every expected holiday below is
TRANSCRIBED from the federal holiday calendar, not computed**: a test that
asked :func:`~app.utils.business_days.federal_holidays` to grade itself --
by rebuilding the nth-weekday arithmetic in the assertion -- would share
one producer with its subject and measure nothing.

The five transcribed years are chosen so that between them they exercise
every branch the module has:

- **2020** predates Juneteenth, so it holds TEN holidays and pins the
  :data:`~app.utils.business_days.JUNETEENTH_FIRST_YEAR` floor.
- **2021** is the FIRST Juneteenth year, and it lands on a Saturday, so the
  floor and the backward observance are pinned in the same row.
- **2025** has no weekend collision at all -- the plain case.
- **2026** puts Independence Day on a Saturday, so it pins the backward
  observance, and it is the year ledger row **N-398** is about.
- **2027** is the hardest year available: Juneteenth and Christmas both
  fall on a Saturday, Independence Day on a Sunday, and New Year's Day
  2028 falls on a Saturday so its observance lands on **2027**-12-31.
  That last one is why the year holds TWELVE.

        Ten statutory holidays before Juneteenth and eleven after, moved by
        the one thing that can change a year's size: a New Year's Day
        falling on a Saturday is observed on 31 December, so the year that
        OWNS it loses one and the year BEFORE it gains one.  The two can
        never BOTH apply to one year -- 1 January of the next year is one
        or two weekdays later than this year's, so it cannot also be a
        Saturday, and there is no such year between 1900 and 2200.  *An
        earlier draft of this docstring called them independent.*

        **What this test actually grades, said honestly.**  It is a whole
        calendar oracle for the Juneteenth FLOOR and the New Year
        SPILLOVER, and it is blind by construction to everything else: a
        COUNT cannot see where a weekday-anchored holiday lands, because
        moving one cannot collide it with another.  An adversarial review
        measured that -- reverting ``_last_weekday`` to the Memorial Day
        2027 defect, and computing MLK as the second Monday of January,
        both leave this test GREEN.  ``_nth_weekday`` and ``_last_weekday``
        are graded by the five transcribed years above and by
        :meth:`test_memorial_day_is_always_the_last_monday_of_may`, not
        here.  *An earlier draft claimed those two functions were "what it
        is really grading", which is the one thing it cannot do.*

        Note also that ``expected`` is not an independent oracle for the
        rule it encodes: the Juneteenth floor and the spillover are
        restated here in miniature, so a shared misreading would pass
        both.  The transcribed 2021 and 2027 rows are what pin those two
        independently.

        A first draft asserted only ``expected`` or ``expected + 1`` and

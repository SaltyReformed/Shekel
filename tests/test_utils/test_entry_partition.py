"""Tests for the shared credit-vs-debit entry partition (deep-hunt #75).

``partition_entries`` is the single definition of "which entries are
credit-card purchases vs direct debits," shared by
``entry_service.compute_entry_sums`` (which sums each group) and
``entry_credit_workflow.sync_entry_payback`` (which needs the credit-entry
list to size and link the CC Payback).  This file pins the partition
contract so both callers share one tested rule:

- an entry is a credit iff ``entry.is_credit`` is true;
- the return order is ``(debit_entries, credit_entries)``, mirroring
  ``compute_entry_sums``'s ``(sum_debit, sum_credit)`` convention;
- input order is preserved within each group.

"""Shekel Budget App -- Unit tests for app.utils.session_helpers.

Locks down two cooperating contracts documented in
``app/utils/session_helpers.py``:

1. Every auth-factor state change that needs to invalidate parallel
   sessions does so by stamping ``users.session_invalidated_at`` and
   refreshing ``flask.session[SESSION_CREATED_AT_KEY]`` with the SAME
   timestamp.  The strict less-than comparison in :func:`app.load_user`
   then rejects every other live session for that user while letting
   the request that issued the helper survive (commit C-08 -- F-002,
   F-003, F-032).

2. The three ``stamp_*`` helpers (``stamp_login_session``,
   ``stamp_reauth_session``, ``stamp_session_refresh``) write the
   right SUBSET of lifecycle keys for each semantic event so the
   loader, the idle-timeout check, and the fresh-login check all
   stay coherent (commit C-10 -- F-006, F-035, F-045).  A regression
   that wrote ``_session_created_at`` on /reauth would silently let
   an attacker bypass a future ``invalidate_other_sessions`` bump;
   a regression that wrote ``_fresh_login_at`` on /invalidate-sessions
   would let the same UI extend the step-up window without typing a
   password.

These tests exercise the helpers in isolation against a real DB and
a real Flask test request context -- no mocks of ``db.session`` or
``flask.session``, because correctness depends on the exact
serialization round-trip of those two pieces of state.

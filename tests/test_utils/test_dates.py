"""Tests for the shared calendar date-arithmetic helpers (deep-hunt #34).

``months_between`` centralizes the "whole calendar months between two
dates, day ignored" convention that was inlined at five financial sites
(escrow inflation, loan amortization remaining/payoff, savings-goal
required-monthly, rate-period numbering).  This file pins the helper's
contract so every caller shares one tested definition:

- The day-of-month is disregarded (only year/month boundaries count).
- The result is signed (``end`` before ``start`` yields a negative).
- Cross-year deltas accumulate 12 per year.
- The inclusive ``+ 1`` and zero-floor that individual callers add stay
  the caller's concern (verified here by composing them with the helper).

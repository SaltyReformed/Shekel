"""
Shekel Budget App -- Test Fixtures

Provides reusable pytest fixtures for the test suite: a configured
test app, a freshly-cloned per-test database, an authenticated
client, and factory helpers for creating test data.

Strategy: each test gets a brand-new database cloned from
``shekel_test_template`` via ``CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE ...``
(Phase 3b of
``docs/audits/test_improvements/test-performance-implementation-plan.md``),
replacing the prior per-test TRUNCATE+reseed cycle.  The per-test
isolation contract (empty ``system.audit_log``, no rows in
``budget.*`` / ``auth.*`` / ``salary.*``, full ref-data seed,
in-process ``ref_cache`` matching the seeded IDs) is bit-for-bit
identical between the two mechanisms -- only the underlying
delivery changes.

The clone uses ``STRATEGY WAL_LOG``.  Phase 3b's original
``STRATEGY FILE_COPY`` was chosen for the reflink path on the dev
box's btrfs PGDATA and is 20x SLOWER on any cluster that has not
switched durability off -- which CI's postgres service container
has not.  ``_clone_worker_database`` below carries the measurements
and the failures that decision produced; do not restore
``FILE_COPY`` without re-measuring against a durable cluster.

    Called once at conftest module-load time, BEFORE any ``app``
    import.  Each pytest invocation (and each pytest-xdist worker
    within an invocation) gets its own database; concurrent
    invocations cannot deadlock on the per-test ``TRUNCATE CASCADE``
    because each operates on its own DB.

    Master-vs-worker detection:
        Under pytest-xdist the master process imports conftest for
        test collection but does not run tests.  It sets
        ``PYTEST_XDIST_TESTRUNUID`` but NOT ``PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER``
        (only the workers carry the latter).  The master must skip
        the bootstrap -- otherwise it would leave a per-PID DB that
        nothing uses and is never dropped.  Single-process pytest
        (no ``-n`` flag) has neither variable set and runs the
        bootstrap as ``worker_id="main"``.

    Orphan cleanup:
        On startup the function drops any leftover database that
        matches the worker's name (the Phase 3b stable form
        ``shekel_test_{worker_id}`` AND the legacy PID-suffix form
        ``shekel_test_{worker_id}_*`` from pre-Phase-3b runs) and
        has no active connections in ``pg_stat_activity``.  Handles
        the case where a previous pytest run crashed (SIGKILL,
        kernel OOM, ...) before ``pytest_sessionfinish`` could
        drop its DB.  Filtering by ``pg_stat_activity`` rather than
        name alone defends against the dropping-of-sibling trap: a
        concurrent pytest invocation (rare but documented in
        testing-standards.md) whose worker happens to share this
        worker_id would have its own live DB in the match list;
        the active-connection filter skips dropping it.  CREATE
        DATABASE later in this function will then fail with
        "database already exists" -- the right fail-loud signal
        that two concurrent invocations cannot share a cluster
        under Phase 3b's stable-name scheme.

    Template existence:
        The bootstrap fails fast with an actionable
        ``RuntimeError`` if ``shekel_test_template`` does not
        exist.  The fix is documented in the error message:
        ``python scripts/build_test_template.py``.

    Clone verification:
        After the clone, a fresh psycopg2 connection counts rows
        in ``ref.account_types``.  Anything other than the
        expected 19 means the template was corrupt at clone time
        and needs to be rebuilt; another actionable error message
        steers the operator to the fix.

    Side effects:
        Sets ``os.environ["TEST_DATABASE_URL"]`` to the per-
        session DSN.  ``app.config.TestConfig`` reads this at
        class-body evaluation time during the next ``from app
        import ...``; the env var write must precede that import.

    Returns:
        ``None`` when bootstrap is skipped (xdist master).
        ``(db_name, admin_url)`` otherwise; ``pytest_sessionfinish``
        uses these to DROP the per-session DB after the suite ends.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: When the template DB is missing, or when
            the freshly-cloned per-session DB carries a row count
            that disagrees with the seed list size.  Both errors

    the same start state the prior TRUNCATE+reseed cycle provided:
    empty ``system.audit_log``, no rows in ``budget.*`` / ``auth.*`` /
    ``salary.*``, full ref-data seed in ``ref.*``.  The template's
    contents come from ``scripts/build_test_template.py``.

    **Why ``STRATEGY WAL_LOG`` and not ``FILE_COPY``.**  This clone
    runs once per TEST, so its cost is multiplied by ~9,000.
    ``FILE_COPY`` makes PostgreSQL force three cluster-wide
    checkpoints per statement (one ``immediate force wait
    flush-all`` before the copy plus one after, and one more for the
    paired ``DROP DATABASE``); ``WAL_LOG`` forces none of its own,
    leaving only the DROP's.  Counted, not assumed: 20 drop+create
    cycles emit 60 forced checkpoints under ``FILE_COPY`` and 20
    under ``WAL_LOG``.

    Those checkpoints are free only on a cluster with durability
    switched off, which is exactly what ``docker-compose.dev.yml``
    gives the dev test-db and what CI's stock postgres service
    container does NOT.  Measured on one host against the real
    12 MB template, 20 drop+create cycles, per cycle:

    ==========================  ===========  ==========
    cluster                     FILE_COPY    WAL_LOG
    ==========================  ===========  ==========
    stock durable (CI's)        1618 ms      80 ms
    ``fsync=off`` (dev's)       31 ms        26 ms
    ==========================  ===========  ==========

    So ``FILE_COPY`` was 20x slower than the default strategy on any
    durable cluster and never faster on a non-durable one, which is
    how CI came to spend 702.8 s of a 1733.55 s run inside a
    single-threaded checkpointer that all 12 xdist workers block on
    -- and why tests carrying a fixed wall-clock budget (the
    ``url_map`` sweep at pytest-timeout's 30 s, the ``seed_user.py``
    subprocesses at 10 s) began failing about half the time from
    2026-08-16.  ``file_copy_method=clone`` does not rescue it: the
    reflink ioctl saves the byte copy, not the checkpoints, and
    measured 1594 ms per cycle on the durable cluster.

    The two strategies differ only in how blocks reach the new
    database, never in what it contains -- verified by diffing
    ``pg_dump`` of a ``FILE_COPY`` clone against a ``WAL_LOG`` clone
    of the same template: identical but for pg_dump's own random
    ``\\restrict`` nonce.  Row IDs, sequences and the
    ``ref.account_types`` count the bootstrap verifies are therefore
    unchanged.

    Args:
        db_name: Name of the per-worker DB to create.
        admin_url: Admin DSN (must NOT point at ``db_name`` itself).
        template: The database to clone FROM.  Defaults to the empty
            ``shekel_test_template``, which is what every test that has not
            declared a seeded start state gets.  A test carrying the
            ``seeded_start_state`` marker passes that world's snapshot instead
            (plan step balance:X-be-2) -- the ISOLATION is identical either
            way, a private database per test; only the content it starts with

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Named seeded start states (plan step balance:X-be-2)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# **A test says what world it starts in; it does not build one.**
#
# The suite has always been able to express two start states: EMPTY -- the
# ``shekel_test_template`` clone every test gets -- and "build it yourself",
# a function-scoped fixture writing rows.  Nothing could say *start from a
# prepared world*, so a module whose every test needs the same world built it
# once per test.
#
# **The measurement, stated once and in full here** -- the other two files
# that cite it give the headline and point at this paragraph, because three
# copies of one number is how two of them come to disagree.  Measured on the
# ``url_map`` sweep serially, 2026-08-30 (local dates; the figures it
# supersedes are 2026-08-29): 236 cases at 302 ms of setup for 22 ms of
# requests, the world byte-identical every time.  Setup was 93% of the file --
# but 93% is NOT the removable share, and reading it as one over-claims by
# about 2x.  That setup splits: ~180 ms the module's own seven-account
# fixture, ~50 ms ``seed_user``, ~30 ms the pay calendar, ~40 ms the per-test
# clone, ~10 ms the login.  A world removes the first three.  **The clone
# stays, because the clone is the isolation.**  End to end the file went
# 82.26 s -> 18.73 s, a 77% cut, which takes it from 6.8x the suite's ordinary
# per-test cost to about 1.0x -- it stops being special, which is the whole of
# what was wanted.
#
# **It is not a suite-level speedup and was not measured as one.**  Full suite
# before 11,770 tests in 278.25 s, after 11,781 in 281.64 s: unchanged, since
# this file is ~2% of the suite's work and the expected saving sits inside a
# run-to-run variance measured at 18 s.
#
# What this seam separates is ISOLATION from CONTENT.  The per-test drop and
# re-clone is what keeps tests independent and it does not change here: every
# test still gets its own database and may write to it freely.  What changes is
# only which database it is cloned FROM.  A world is built once per worker into
# a snapshot database, and the marker names it:
#
#     @pytest.mark.seeded_start_state("baseline_less_owner")
#     class TestSomething:
#         ...
#
# **Why a snapshot database rather than a wider fixture scope.**  A
# module- or class-scoped fixture cannot hold this state: every test on an
# xdist worker shares ONE database, so the next test from any OTHER module
# re-clones it mid-module.  Observed under ``-n 12`` on 2026-08-29 with gw0,
# gw10 and gw11 each running two modules interleaved -- measured, not inferred
# from the scheduler's documentation.  ``xdist_group`` pins a group to one
# worker and does not keep other tests off that worker, so it is not the fix
# either.  A snapshot is a different database, so nothing else re-clones it.
#
# **Why it is never persisted between runs.**  A world holds rows dated from
# ``display_today()``, so a snapshot kept across midnight -- or across a
# builder edit -- would be a start state no code describes.  It is built at
# first use and dropped in ``pytest_sessionfinish``; the name carries the
# worker DB as its prefix so the bootstrap's existing orphan sweep collects one
# a SIGKILL left behind.  This is finding **N-385**'s shape (a stored artifact
# whose stamp says current while its content is not), and the answer there is
# the same: do not stamp it harder, do not keep it.
#
# **A world is built inside the ``db`` fixture, so it CANNOT see an autouse
# fixture defined in a SUBDIRECTORY conftest, and that is a real limit rather
# than an oversight.**  ``db`` names the two autouse fixtures in THIS file that
# a builder needs, which orders them ahead of it; it cannot name a fixture
# defined below it in the tree, and those sort after ``db`` unconditionally.
# The live example: ``tests/test_services/conftest.py`` freezes
# ``pay_period_service.date.today()`` to a fixed day for every test under it.
# A world declared there would be BUILT on the real clock and then READ by
# tests that see the frozen one.  No world is declared under such a conftest
# today.  Before adding one, check what its directory's conftest does to the
# environment -- the build will not have had it.
#
# **A test that declares a world may not ALSO request a fixture that seeds the
# same rows.**  ``seed_user`` inside a test whose world already holds that owner
# inserts a second one and PostgreSQL refuses it on the unique email -- loudly,
# at the fixture, which is why this is a note rather than a guard: the failure
# names the collision itself, and a guard would have to enumerate which fixtures
# write what, which is the census this seam exists to stop anyone keeping.  A
# test needing a DIFFERENT owner declares no world (see
# ``TestTheHandlerIsInertForAHealthyOwner`` in the no-baseline sweep) or gets
# its own.
#
# **What a builder may return.**  Plain data only -- ids and scalars.  The
# dict is computed once, at build time, and handed to every test that asks for
# the world; an ORM object in it would be bound to a session that closed with
# the build, and a caller would get a detached row rather than an error.  Row
# ids are safe because ``CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE`` preserves them, which
# is the same property the per-test clone already depends on for ``ref.*``.

    Four separate defects in this suite had exactly one trigger: the day of the
    month the suite happened to run on (findings N-131, N-132, R8, and the two
    loan cross-surface tests that failed on 2026-08-01).  Each was found by a
    merge gate rather than by a test, because nothing here could ask "does this
    still pass on the 1st?".  This is that instrument::

        SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY=2026-09-01 ./scripts/test.sh

    ``tick=True`` keeps the clock RUNNING from the faked instant rather than
    freezing it, because a frozen clock makes every ``created_at`` in a session
    identical and the fold's assertion ordering (ruling R-DH: two assertions
    sharing a civil day apply in recording order) then has no order to read.

    **What it can and cannot move, stated because the gap decides how to read a
    failure.**  It moves the PYTHON clock -- ``date.today()``,
    ``datetime.now()`` and therefore :func:`app.utils.dates.display_today`.  It
    does NOT move POSTGRES: ``created_at`` / ``updated_at`` are
    ``server_default=db.func.now()`` (``app/models/mixins.py:237-263``),
    evaluated in the database.  (The settle day was a fourth such reach until
    plan step X-f1; the seam stamps ``display_today()`` into a ``DATE`` column
    now, which this instrument DOES move.)  So under a fake date every
    server-stamped row
    carries the REAL instant, and a test comparing a fixture-built date against
    a server-stamped one fails by the offset between them.  That failure is an
    artifact of this instrument, not a defect in the test -- see
    ``docs/testing-standards.md`` for how to tell the two apart.

    infrastructure, indexes, and reference seed data are therefore

    state's builder, which is ordinary application code, and the first attempt

    refused the suite's own seed password with a message about a data breach.

    is what says so out loud if the next builder needs a fixture nobody added

    Drops the per-worker DB and re-clones it from
    ``shekel_test_template`` via
    ``CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE ... STRATEGY WAL_LOG``
    (Phase 3b of test-performance-implementation-plan.md).  Each
    test gets bit-for-bit the same start state the prior
    TRUNCATE+reseed cycle provided:

      * ``system.audit_log`` empty -- the template carries zero
        rows by construction; ``scripts/build_test_template.py``
        truncates the log after the seed commits.
      * No rows in ``budget.*`` / ``auth.*`` / ``salary.*`` -- the
        template is freshly migrated and seeded with reference
        data only.
      * Full ref-data seed in ``ref.*`` including the 19
        ``ref.account_types`` built-ins.
      * In-process ``ref_cache`` and Jinja globals re-seated to
        match the cloned DB's row IDs (which equal the template's
        IDs because ``CREATE DATABASE TEMPLATE`` preserves them).

    **A test that declares a SEEDED START STATE gets the first, third and
    fourth of those and not the second** (plan step balance:X-be-2): its
    database is cloned from that world's snapshot, so it starts holding the
    rows the world's builder wrote.  ``system.audit_log`` is still empty --
    the build truncates it, for the reason the template builder does -- and
    the ref data and cached ids are still the template's, because the snapshot
    is itself a clone of the template.  **What does NOT change is the
    isolation**: the drop and re-clone below run for every test either way, so
    a test still cannot see another's writes.  Only the database it is cloned
    FROM differs.

    Mechanism, in order:

      1. ``setup_rollback`` -- defensive ``session.rollback()`` in
         case a prior test left a stale transaction.  Empirically
         a no-op (Phase 0 measured ~0.0 ms).
      2. Release the engine: ``session.remove()`` detaches the
         scoped session; ``engine.dispose()`` closes every pooled
         connection.  Prerequisites for ``DROP DATABASE WITH
         (FORCE)`` -- the FORCE clause severs leftover backends at
         the protocol level, but disposing here avoids the race
         and keeps the engine pool aligned with the freshly-cloned
         DB on the next session access.  Untimed because the
         steady-state cost is ~0 ms (the previous test's teardown
         already disposed).
      3. ``setup_drop_db`` -- admin-DSN ``DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS
         {worker_db} WITH (FORCE)``.
      4. ``setup_clone_template`` -- admin-DSN ``CREATE DATABASE
         {worker_db} TEMPLATE shekel_test_template STRATEGY
         WAL_LOG``.  See ``_clone_worker_database`` for why the
         strategy is named explicitly and what ``FILE_COPY`` cost.
      5. ``setup_refresh_ref_cache`` -- re-seat the in-process
         ref_cache and Jinja globals against the cloned DB.  The
         row IDs are identical to the template's (CLONE preserves
         them), but reseating costs ~5-7 ms and covers the edge
         case where a future migration changes the seeded ID set
         without anyone updating the in-process cache eagerly.

    Why the worker DB name is stable across the session: the URL
    the Flask-SQLAlchemy engine binds to at app-creation time is
    derived from ``TEST_DATABASE_URL`` set by
    ``_bootstrap_worker_database``; that URL remains valid across
    every drop+reclone because only the underlying database is
    swapped, never the URL.  ``engine.dispose()`` between tests
    forces the pool to reconnect on the next session access, and
    the connection re-establishes against the cloned DB at the
    same URL.

    The ``_profile_step`` wrappers below are no-ops when
    ``SHEKEL_TEST_FIXTURE_PROFILE`` is unset; when set they capture
    per-step elapsed time for the Phase 0 harness (see the block
    comment near ``_FIXTURE_PROFILE_ENABLED`` at the top of this

    ``_drop_seed_user_bootstrap``, 135 lines that carried out a schedule reset
    by hand: it re-stated the account's opening, deleted the opening pay period
    with a bare ``query.delete()``, renumbered every survivor with raw SQL
    (``SET period_index = period_index - 1``), and then re-posted the anchor
    corrections that delete had disposed.

    **The application already has a door that does that job**:
    ``pay_period_admin.reset_pay_periods``, the settings-page correction that
    wipes every period, rebuilds the schedule from a new opening payday and
    re-syncs the loan genesis postings and the account anchor corrections onto
    what it built.  It is not "exactly" the hand-rolled sequence -- it does
    strictly MORE, and the extra is one of the three differences below.  Each
    difference was a defect in the hand-rolled version:

    * it renumbered ``period_index`` ITSELF -- a fixture computing by hand the
      derived column this arc exists to delete, in raw SQL the ORM cannot see;
    * it never re-synced LOAN genesis postings, so a world holding a loan would
      have been rebuilt with that loan's opening entries missing;
    * it recorded the new batch BESIDE the surviving opening period and deleted
      that period afterwards, so the new periods were written at indices 1..N
      and pulled back to 0..N-1.  The door retires and records in ONE
      ``record_paydays`` call, so they are 0..N-1 when they are written.

    **It refutes ledger row N-392's diagnosis**, which says the seeded account
    reaches its resting state "through a DELETE of the pay period it was opened
    against, which no production path performs".  ``reset_pay_periods`` deletes
    every pay period the owner has, the account's own opening period included,
    and it is reachable from ``POST /pay-periods/reset``.  What was true is
    narrower: no production path performed the hand-rolled SEQUENCE.

    **The re-statement of the account's opening is deliberately NOT carried
    over, and that is measured rather than argued.**  The deleted helper moved
    the books to ``min(governing.opened_on, new_anchor.start_date - 1 day)`` --
    backward only.  Every owner this file builds opens its books the day before
    :data:`SEED_USER_BOOTSTRAP_START`, and every calendar this function is
    asked for starts later than that, so the ``min`` always chose the day
    already stored: the call could not move a day in any world this file
    builds.  ``TestTheResetDoesNotMoveTheBooks`` in
    ``tests/test_arch/test_the_seeded_calendar_comes_from_the_writer.py`` holds

    cheaper fixture.

    Like :func:`seed_periods_today` it RESETS the seeded owner's schedule

    that up-to-six-day alignment is itself worth a period or more and today

    The shared period-construction step behind ``seed_cross_page_account``

    ``[today.year - 1, today.year + 1]`` (``period_index`` 1..36, sitting
    cleanly above the ``seed_user`` bootstrap at index 0), then returns the
    full ordered period list and the anchor period (the calendar month
    containing today).

    Monthly (not biweekly) periods are deliberate: the anchor period's
    ``end_date`` IS a calendar month-end, so the C9-3 boundary invariant of
    the seam's :func:`app.services.balance_at.cash_balance_at` makes the
    calendar surface's projected month-end balance equal the anchor-period
    balance for the same data.  The anchor being the month containing today also
    lets ``PayCalendar.period_containing`` land on it with no date-mock
    plumbing.

    **This is the one calendar in this file the application cannot write, and
    that is why it is still built by hand** (ledger row **P76**, plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C4-b-1``).  ``pay_period_write.record_paydays`` spaces a
    batch at ONE cadence; calendar months are 28 to 31 days apart, so no door
    produces this schedule and no owner can have one.  Every other periods
    fixture here goes through :func:`_reset_seed_calendar`.  Plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C4-c``, which re-bases every hand-written ``PayPeriod(...)``
    when the two derived columns drop, owns the question of what these cases
    should assert on instead.

    The seeded owner's opening pay period is left in place beneath these, at
    ``period_index`` 0.  *The reason recorded here was that deleting it would
    cascade ``AccountAnchorHistory.pay_period_id`` and race an autoflush; that
    column no longer exists -- ruling ``balance:R-EO`` deleted it and its
    CASCADE FK -- so the stated hazard has had no subject for some time.* What
    is true is that keeping it is benign for the lock: it is a 2024 pre-anchor
    period every surface skips (the resolver only emits balances from the
    anchor period forward, and grid / dashboard / savings / accounts all key
    off the period CONTAINING today, which is today's month rather than the
    opening one).

    that materialises one symptom-tuple case shared across every
    balance-rendering surface (grid, /savings, /accounts checking detail,
    dashboard, year-end net-worth per-account, calendar).  The fixture
    realises the structural premise of HIGH-01 -- the developer's worst
    two symptoms (#1 $160 grid vs $114.29 /savings; #5 /accounts matches
    nowhere) had zero falsifying tests until this lock landed (Commit 11).

    The realised data shape is invariant across cases:

      * The user's existing seed_user bootstrap pay period is removed and
        replaced with 24 calendar-monthly periods spanning
        ``[today.year - 1, today.year + 1]``.  Monthly (not biweekly)
        periods are chosen deliberately so the anchor period's
        ``end_date`` IS a calendar month-end -- the C9-3 boundary
        invariant of the seam's :func:`app.services.balance_at.cash_balance_at`
        then guarantees the calendar surface's projected month-end balance
        equals the anchor-period balance for the same data.
        Without that alignment a mid-period month-end would silently make
        the calendar surface look like a divergence even when the
        underlying math agrees, defeating the cross-page lock.
      * The anchor period is the calendar month containing today (so the
        dashboard's containment lookup and the grid's window both naturally
        land on the anchor period without any date-mock plumbing).  Those
        two named ``get_current_period`` and ``get_periods_in_range`` until
        pay-calendar plan steps C2-f2b and C2-f3a deleted them; the
        alignment is what matters and it is unchanged.
      * The account anchor is overridden -- via a fresh
        ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row + cache-column update, latest-wins
        per E-19 -- to the case's ``anchor_balance``.  ``seed_user``'s
        factory-default $1,000 anchor is irrelevant here.
      * A single Projected envelope expense in the anchor period with
        ``estimated_amount = expense_amount`` and the supplied entries
        list, each entry dated ``anchor_period.start_date`` (so all
        entries fall on or before any month-end ``as_of`` the calendar
        surface evaluates).

    The factory returns a context dict keyed:

      * ``user_id``, ``account``, ``account_id``, ``scenario``,
        ``scenario_id``: identifiers callers pass to every surface.
      * ``all_periods``, ``anchor_period``: the period list and the
        chosen anchor period.
      * ``year``, ``month``: ``anchor_period.start_date.year /
        .month`` -- the calendar/year-end surfaces consume these.

    The five remediation-plan cases (PT-01 base, zero anchor, negative
    overdraft, credit-only entries, uncleared-floor) are realised by the
    test's ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` block, not baked into the
    fixture, so a future case can be added in one place without growing
    a conftest variant.

    Returns:
        Callable ``(anchor_balance, expense_amount, entries) ->
        dict``.  Each entry is a 3-tuple ``(amount, is_credit,
        is_settled)`` -- amount as ``Decimal`` (from string), and the two
        booleans as the entries-aware reduction's discriminants.
        ``is_settled`` stamps the purchase's ``settled_on`` with the anchor
        period's start day, which is the assertion's own ``observed_on``
        here, so the purchase reads as already inside the asserted balance

    """Drop the per-pytest-worker database AND emit the profile summary.

    Pytest invokes this hook at the end of every session -- including
    failed sessions -- so the per-session DB is cleaned up regardless
    of pass/fail.  No-op when the xdist master process skipped the
    bootstrap (``_BOOTSTRAP_RESULT`` is ``None``); only worker
    processes own a DB to drop.

    Why psycopg2 directly (not SQLAlchemy):
        Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.x scopes ``db.session`` and ``db.engine``
        to the current app context, and the
        ``pytest_sessionfinish`` hook runs AFTER the session-scoped
        ``app`` fixture has torn down -- there is no active app
        context to bind to.  Wrapping the cleanup in a fresh app
        context would require either keeping the session-scoped app
        alive via module-level state or building a new app, both
        of which add complexity for the same end state.  The per-
        test ``db`` fixture already calls ``_db.session.remove`` and
        ``_db.engine.dispose`` inside its app context after every
        test, so by the time this hook runs there are no live
        SQLAlchemy connections to release -- and the
        ``WITH (FORCE)`` clause severs any backend that did
        escape, at the protocol level.  See
        ``docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/per-worker-database-plan.md``
        Phase 3 for the broader context.

    Survives SIGKILL imperfectly: a process killed before this hook
    runs leaves an orphan DB.  The next session's bootstrap drops it
    via the ``shekel_test_{worker_id}_*`` cleanup pass (see
    :func:`_bootstrap_worker_database`), so the orphan is at worst
    a temporary disk-space cost between runs.

    Profile aggregation:
        When ``SHEKEL_TEST_FIXTURE_PROFILE`` is set, the harness
        printed by :func:`_profile_print_summary` reads every per-
        worker CSV under ``tests/.fixture-profile/`` and writes a
        single summary table to stdout.  Only the xdist controller
        (or, in single-process runs, the test process itself)
        prints; workers are write-only.  The aggregator runs AFTER
        the DB drop so a flaky summary path cannot leave per-
        session databases behind.

    Args:
        session (pytest.Session): pytest Session object (required
            by the hook signature; unused here -- the cleanup keys
            off the module-level ``_BOOTSTRAP_RESULT`` instead).
        exitstatus (int): Session exit code.  Unused: we drop the
            per-session DB regardless of pass / fail because it is
            throwaway.

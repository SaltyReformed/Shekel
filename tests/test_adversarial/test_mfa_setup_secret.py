"""
Shekel Budget App -- Adversarial Tests for MFA Setup Secret Storage

Regression tests that lock down the C-05 contract: the unconfirmed
TOTP secret captured during ``/mfa/setup`` must live server-side in
``auth.mfa_configs.pending_secret_encrypted`` (encrypted under the
application's Fernet/MultiFernet key) rather than in
``flask_session["_mfa_setup_secret"]``.  Flask's default
``SecureCookieSessionInterface`` signs but does NOT encrypt the
session cookie, so any value placed in the session is recoverable by
anyone who can read the cookie -- the user's browser, a malicious
extension, or anyone with read access to a shared profile.

If any of these tests starts failing, the F-031 fix has regressed.
Related: ``docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/remediation-plan.md`` C-05.

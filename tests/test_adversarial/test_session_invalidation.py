"""Shekel Budget App -- Adversarial Tests for Session Invalidation (C-08).

End-to-end coverage for the three cluster findings closed by commit
C-08 of the 2026-04-15 security remediation plan:

  * F-002 (CWE-613): pending-MFA session state has no time limit.
    Closed by ``_mfa_pending_at`` + ``_MFA_PENDING_MAX_AGE`` in
    ``app/routes/auth.py``.

  * F-003 (CWE-613): backup-code consumption does not invalidate
    other sessions.  Closed by the ``invalidate_other_sessions``
    call inside the backup-code branch of :func:`mfa_verify`.

  * F-032 (CWE-613): MFA disable does not invalidate other sessions.
    Closed by the ``invalidate_other_sessions`` call at the end of
    :func:`mfa_disable_confirm`.

Tests in this file run two test clients side-by-side -- one
representing a "compromised" session that should be terminated, the
other representing the user's new trusted session.  A regression on
any of the three findings would leave the compromised session alive,
which these tests detect by GETting a protected page from the
compromised client and asserting a 302 to /login.

Why adversarial, not unit:  the C-08 contract is a composition of
``users.session_invalidated_at``, the cookie's
``_session_created_at``, the helper, and ``app.load_user``.  A unit
test can verify each piece in isolation (and ``test_session_helpers.py``
does), but only an end-to-end multi-client test catches a regression
where the pieces are correct individually but wired together wrong.

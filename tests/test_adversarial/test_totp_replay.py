"""Shekel Budget App -- Adversarial Tests for TOTP Replay Prevention (C-09).

End-to-end coverage for the two findings closed by commit C-09 of the
2026-04-15 security remediation plan:

  * F-005 (CWE-294): ``pyotp.TOTP.verify(..., valid_window=1)`` is
    stateless, so any observed 6-digit TOTP code remains replayable
    for ~90 seconds (the +-1 step drift window) until the code rotates
    out.  Closed by ``mfa_configs.last_totp_timestep`` plus the
    strict-greater check in ``mfa_service.verify_totp_code``.

  * F-142 (Low): no structured log event for replay detection.  Closed
    by emitting ``totp_replay_rejected`` from
    ``app/routes/auth.py:mfa_verify`` and ``mfa_disable_confirm`` when
    ``verify_totp_code`` returns ``REPLAY``.

The unit-level coverage in ``tests/test_services/test_mfa_service.py``
exercises the verifier in isolation.  This file exercises the route
glue: the column update is committed across requests, the log event is
emitted on the right path, the replay-rejection branch returns the
right HTTP response, and the cross-route invariants (mfa_verify,
mfa_disable_confirm, mfa_confirm) all interact with
``last_totp_timestep`` consistently.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Concurrent Modification Tests (L-15)

Verifies that critical financial endpoints handle simultaneous requests
without data corruption.  Uses threading.Barrier to synchronize two
threads hitting the same endpoint at the same instant against a real
PostgreSQL database.

Each test creates its own data, runs two concurrent operations, and
asserts that the final database state satisfies an invariant.  The
tests do not assert which thread "wins" -- only that the outcome is
consistent and no data is lost or corrupted.

No application code is modified.  If a test reveals an actual race
condition bug, it is documented with a comment and marked xfail.

    Two threads simultaneously PATCH /accounts/<id>/true-up with
    different balance values.  The invariants:

      1. Neither request produces a 500.
      2. BOTH return 200, and BOTH assertions are recorded.
      3. The resolved balance is one of the two submitted values.

      4. The account's LINKED LEDGER sums to the resolved assertion.

    **Invariant 2 was the opposite until plan step X-f1c3c** (ruling R-EN),
    and this docstring is rewritten rather than annotated because the old
    text read as instructions to restore the deleted behaviour.  It said:
    after commit C-17 the route is no longer last-write-wins, the loser
    detects a stale ``version_id`` at flush time, and the route answers 409 --
    so at least one request returns 200 and any non-200 must be a 409.

    None of that survives, because the true-up stopped writing the row the
    lock guarded.  A true-up APPENDS an assertion, so there is nothing to
    contend for: two assertions of different balances are two FACTS, the
    later-observed one is current, and neither is lost.  **A 409 here is now a
    regression, not a contract.**  Two threads asserting the SAME balance on
    the same day are still idempotent -- since ruling R-EQ the write door
    compares against the governing assertion under the owner's write lock, so
    the waiter sees the winner's row, writes nothing and reports success.

    **Invariant 4 is the one this class was missing, and it is the reason the
    409's deletion was not free.**  "Append-only" is true of
    ``account_anchor_history`` and FALSE of the transaction a true-up runs: it
    also RECONCILES the account's posted corrections, which reads what is
    posted, subtracts it from what the assertions say, and writes the
    difference.  The deleted ``version_id`` UPDATE had been serialising that
    read-modify-write by accident, because it autoflushed and took a row lock
    before the walk.  Measured with the interleave forced at the reconcile's
    read: both requests answer 200, both assertions are recorded, and the
    resolver returns one of them -- every invariant above HELD -- while the
    account's linked ledger settled at ``$1,000.00`` against a resolved
    ``$2,000.00``.  Invariants 1-3 cannot see that, and the trial balance
    cannot either, because the anchor-equity leg mirrors the error exactly.
    The serialisation is now explicit and per-owner
    (:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`), and its own deterministic tests are
    in ``tests/test_services/test_user_write_lock.py``; invariant 4 is what
    grades the MONEY rule those tests protect.

    The old "tolerance for serialised-without-contention runs" paragraph is
    gone with the branch it excused: {200, 200} is no longer the rare
    scheduler-dependent outcome, it is the only correct one, so this no longer
    passes for two different reasons depending on the OS scheduler.

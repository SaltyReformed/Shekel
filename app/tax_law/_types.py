"""The shapes the tax law is written in, and the checks that make a malformed year unwritable.

Every value is a frozen dataclass over ``Decimal`` literals: the law is data the
release carries, never a row a user or a deploy can write (ruling
**salary:R-SAL74**).  A year is checked when its module is imported, so a
transcription slip in next year's figures -- a bracket ladder with a gap, a
filing status left out, a rate written as a percent -- stops the application
from starting rather than pricing a paycheck against it.

**The checks replace the per-user tables' constraints, one for one, and are
never narrower.**  Until plan step salary:X-at-1 each user's copy of the law sat
in five ``salary`` tables (unread since, and dropped at plan step X-at-2) whose
columns refuse a malformed row: amounts are ``Numeric(12, 2)`` and rates
``Numeric(5, 4)``, both ``NOT NULL`` where the law requires a figure, every
amount at least zero, the Social Security wage base and the Additional Medicare
threshold above zero, every rate between 0 and 1, a bracket's upper bound at or
above its lower one and a child deduction tier's above it, a state code of two
characters, and a tax year between 2000 and 2100.  Each of those is a check
below, on the dataclass that carries the figure, so no year can hold what no
table could.

**Several are stricter than the tables, because a per-row CHECK cannot state
them or the column chose otherwise:** every filing status present in each year
and each state, and FICA in every year; a ladder's rungs ordered by position
and climbing from zero without a gap to one open top (a child deduction table
likewise, when a state has one); no empty bracket (its table allowed an upper
bound EQUAL to the lower one); a state code of two capital letters; a state's
standard deduction always stated (``$0.00`` where it has none; the column
allowed ``NULL``); a figure with more decimal places than its column refused
where the column silently rounded it, because a transcription that disagrees
with its scale is a slip to fix, not a figure to reinterpret; a law that
cannot change once it loads, because every mapping in it is a read-only view;
and no year skipped between two the law carries (ruling salary:R-SAL86).

**The attribute names are the calculator's.**  :mod:`app.services.tax_calculator`
reads ``standard_deduction``, ``brackets`` (each ``min_income`` / ``max_income``
/ ``rate`` / ``sort_order``), the three credit amounts and the five FICA
figures off whatever it is handed; these carry exactly those names, so the
calculator prices the law without knowing where it came from.

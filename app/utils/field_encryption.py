"""Shekel Budget App -- the field-encryption key, as the environment states it.

The ONE home of what ``FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` and its rotation twin
``FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD`` mean: the names, the parse of their values
into the ordered Fernet list a ``MultiFernet`` is built from, and the
refusal an environment still spelling the key's OLD names meets.  No
Flask, no models -- ``app.config`` reads this module at import time to
validate a production configuration, and ``app.services.mfa_service``
reads it at call time to build the cipher.

The key was ``TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`` until plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-2``
renamed it (ledger row BI-503): it encrypts every ciphertext column the
app stores (``auth.mfa_configs``' TOTP secret), and ``TOTP`` named one of
them.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Structured Log Event Definitions

Defines standardized event categories, a registry of every Python-tier
event the application emits, and a helper for emitting structured log
entries with consistent fields.  All log events include the event name
and category as structured ``extra`` fields, making them filterable in
Grafana/Loki.

Three layers of audit coverage cooperate to produce the project's
forensic record (commit C-13, C-14, C-15 of the 2026-04-15 security
remediation plan):

  1. **DB-tier triggers** write to ``system.audit_log`` on every
     INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against financial/auth tables.  Most
     tamper-resistant -- the runtime app role cannot DROP the trigger.
  2. **Python-tier ``log_event``** (this module) emits structured
     events at every service-layer mutation.  Enables "what happened"
     queries keyed by event name without scanning audit_log row diffs.
  3. **Off-host shipping** flows both layers to S3 / Loki / rsyslog so
     the app container cannot rewrite history.

Event naming convention:  ``<verb>_<noun>`` or ``<noun>_<event>`` in
snake_case.  Every event used in the codebase MUST be registered here
via :func:`_register` so tests can assert completeness and so
operators can introspect the catalogue from the Python REPL.

Audit references: F-080 (Medium), F-085 (Low), F-144 (Low) -- all
remediated by commit C-14.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Event category constants
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Categories partition the event namespace by *intent*.  A single
# category-string travels with every record, so dashboards can filter
# (e.g. "show me every ACCESS event in the last hour") without having
# to maintain a name-to-category lookup table at query time.

#: Authentication and credential lifecycle (login/logout, password
#: change, MFA enrol/verify/disable, lockouts, HIBP rejections).
AUTH = "auth"

#: Business-domain mutations (transfers, transactions, entries, pay
#: periods, recurrence generation, carry-forward).  The dominant
#: category for service-tier events.
BUSINESS = "business"

#: Authorization decisions and IDOR boundary events (cross-user
#: resource access denied, owner-only route blocked, true 404s).
#: Distinguishing ACCESS from AUTH lets SOC tooling alert on probing
#: patterns without false-positives from password failures.
ACCESS = "access"

#: Reserved category for explicit audit-trail markers that do not fit
#: the other categories (e.g. compliance attestations, manual data
#: corrections).  No events emit under AUDIT today; the constant is
#: here so a future feature can add one without bumping the registry's
#: schema version.
AUDIT = "audit"

#: Unhandled-error events emitted alongside an exception trace so the
#: operator can wire alerting on event-name without grepping
#: tracebacks.
ERROR = "error"

#: Per-request lifecycle (slow_request, request_complete) emitted by
#: ``app.utils.logging_config``.  Not a service-tier category.
PERFORMANCE = "performance"


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Event registry
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every event the application emits via :func:`log_event` MUST be
# registered here.  The registry serves three purposes:
#
#   1. **Test completeness gate.**  ``tests/test_utils/test_log_events.py``
#      asserts that no two events share a name and that every category
#      string is one of the constants above.  A new event that is
#      emitted but not registered makes the test fail loudly.
#
#   2. **Operator introspection.**  ``python -c "from app.utils.log_events
#      import EVENT_REGISTRY; pprint(EVENT_REGISTRY)"`` lists every
#      Python-tier event the app can emit, the category each falls
#      under, and a one-line description.  Used by the SOC runbook.
#
#   3. **Self-documenting call sites.**  Service modules import the
#      ``EVT_*`` symbol rather than passing a bare string, so a typo
#      surfaces at import time as a NameError rather than at run time
#      as a silent observability gap.

EVENT_REGISTRY: dict[str, dict[str, str]] = {}

Shekel Budget App -- Account Validation Helpers

Shared validation helpers and Marshmallow schema singletons for the
``app.routes.accounts`` package.  Extracted in Commit 21 of the
financial-calculation follow-up remediation (F-1) when the monolithic
``app/routes/accounts.py`` was split into per-sub-domain modules.

The helpers fall into two groups:

* **Multi-tenant ``ref.account_types`` ownership** (commit C-28 /
  F-044).  ``_visible_account_types`` enumerates the seeded built-ins
  plus the caller's own custom types; ``_owned_account_type`` looks
  up a single owned row for per-type mutation routes;
  ``_account_type_is_visible`` is the route-layer guard that prevents
  a forged form from re-parenting an account onto another owner's
  custom type.

* **``Account`` update validation** (consolidates the four early-
  return gates of the ``update_account`` route into a single helper).
  ``_validate_update_account`` returns a ``(data, failure)`` tuple
  so the route owns the flash + redirect composition while this
  module owns the business validation.

* **Posting-boundary type guards** (Build-Order Step 5, C6).  A
  re-type of an account (``_validate_account_type_change``) or an
  in-place edit of a custom type's ``has_amortization`` /
  ``category_id`` (``_validate_account_type_boundary_edit``) that
  crosses the amortizing or Asset/Liability boundary is refused while
  the affected account(s) carry ledger postings -- see
  ``_crosses_posting_boundary`` for why exactly those two boundaries.

The six Marshmallow schema singletons (``_anchor_schema``,
``_create_schema``, ``_update_schema``, ``_type_create_schema``,
``_type_update_schema``, ``_interest_params_schema``) are also kept
here so every sub-domain module in the accounts package imports the
same instance -- preserving the pre-split behaviour where each
schema was constructed exactly once at module load.

Services boundary: this module is a route-layer helper, not a
service.  It imports the SQLAlchemy ``db`` proxy and reads the
SQLAlchemy ``Account`` / ``AccountType`` rows directly because it
exists to keep route bodies thin.  No Flask request globals are
touched -- callers pass the current user id in explicitly.

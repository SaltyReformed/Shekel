"""Shekel Budget App -- Security-event "was this you?" notifications.

Audit reference: F-091 (Low) / C-16 of the 2026-04-15 security
remediation plan.  C-16 also folds in F-114 (seed-script PII redaction)
and F-160 (log scrubber); see ``scripts/seed_user.py``,
``scripts/seed_tax_brackets.py``, and ``app/utils/logging_config.py``
for those.

What this module does
---------------------

When the user (or someone holding their session) performs a security-
relevant change -- password rotation, MFA enrolment / disable, backup-
code regeneration -- we stamp the moment and the kind of change on the
``auth.users`` row.  The next time the user loads any authenticated
page, the base template renders a dismissible "was this you?" banner
explaining what changed and offering a link to the security settings
section in case it was not.

The persisted columns are:

  * ``users.last_security_event_at`` -- timezone-aware datetime of the
    most recent security-relevant change.  ``NULL`` for new accounts
    that have never had one.
  * ``users.last_security_event_kind`` -- short machine-readable code
    naming the change (one of :class:`SecurityEventKind`).  ``NULL``
    iff ``last_security_event_at`` is also ``NULL``.
  * ``users.last_security_event_acknowledged_at`` -- timezone-aware
    datetime of the user's most recent banner dismissal.  ``NULL``
    until the user dismisses one.  The banner is visible iff
    ``last_security_event_at`` is set AND
    (``last_security_event_acknowledged_at`` is NULL OR
    ``acknowledged_at < event_at``).

Storing acknowledgement on the row (not in ``flask.session``) is a
deliberate robustness choice: a user who logs in on a new device or
clears cookies still sees the banner if a recent change has not been
acknowledged anywhere, AND an attacker who triggers a change cannot
hide the banner from the legitimate user just by dismissing it on
their own session.

What this module does NOT do
----------------------------

  * It does NOT itself emit ``log_event`` calls -- the route handlers
    that motivate the security event already log via
    ``EVT_PASSWORD_CHANGED`` / ``EVT_MFA_ENABLED`` / ``EVT_MFA_DISABLED``
    / ``EVT_BACKUP_CODES_REGENERATED``.  Adding a second log line here
    would double-count the same event in dashboards.
  * It does NOT commit the SQLAlchemy session.  The caller batches
    the security-event stamp with the credential change so a failure
    in either rolls both back atomically.  See the docstring on
    :func:`record_security_event` for the exact contract.
  * It does NOT send an email.  C-16 / F-091 explicitly defers email
    notifications -- the in-app banner is the MVP path.

The kind enum
-------------

:class:`SecurityEventKind` is a ``str``-valued ``enum.Enum`` so kind
values can travel through SQLAlchemy as plain ``VARCHAR`` while still
being comparable with ``is`` in Python.  The full set of allowed
values is mirrored at the database layer by
``ck_users_security_event_kind`` (see the migration), so a future
typo in this enum cannot persist a kind that the banner template
cannot render.

class SecurityEventKind(str, enum.Enum):
    """Allowed values for ``users.last_security_event_kind``.

    ``str``-valued so SQLAlchemy can serialise the member directly
    via ``member.value`` without a custom converter, AND so the
    Jinja banner template can compare ``user.last_security_event_kind
    == SecurityEventKind.PASSWORD_CHANGED.value`` without importing
    the enum.

    The backing database CHECK constraint enumerates these same four
    values; see the migration that adds the column.  Adding a kind
    requires:

      1. Adding the member here.
      2. Adding the value to ``KIND_DISPLAY`` below.
      3. Updating the DB CHECK constraint via a new migration.
      4. Wiring the route handler that motivates the new kind.

# Per-kind display copy rendered by ``_security_event_banner.html``.
# Keeping the strings here (not in the template) keeps the security-
# critical wording in version-controlled Python so a careless template
# edit cannot silently soften the alert.  Two fields per kind:
#
#   * ``title``  -- short heading used as the banner's emphasized
#                   text.  Renders inside a ``<strong>``.
#   * ``detail`` -- one-sentence body copy, ending in a period.  No
#                   HTML; the template handles emphasis.
#
# The "was this you?" phrasing is intentional.  It frames the banner
# as a verification prompt rather than a status notification, which
# nudges the user to act if the change was unauthorised.  The link to
# the security settings page is added by the template, not embedded
# in these strings, so the security copy is plain text and trivially
# auditable for HTML-injection (it has none).

    Sets ``last_security_event_at`` to ``now`` (defaulting to the
    current UTC time) and ``last_security_event_kind`` to
    ``kind.value``.  Does NOT commit -- the caller is expected to
    batch this with the credential change that motivated it so a
    rollback of one rolls back the other.

    Because the helper writes the kind enum's ``.value`` directly

    ``ck_users_security_event_kind`` is the load-bearing safety net:
    a programming-error attempt to call this with an unrecognised
    kind would still fail at commit time when the CHECK rejects the

    failure mode from "IntegrityError 500" to "TypeError at the

        kind: One of :class:`SecurityEventKind`.  Must be the enum
            member, not a bare string, so a typo at the call site

        now: Optional override for the timestamp.  Defaults to
            ``datetime.now(timezone.utc)``.  Tests pass an explicit

"""Shekel Budget App -- Session lifecycle helpers.

Two cooperating concerns live in this module:

  1. Force-invalidate every session for a given user EXCEPT the one
     making the current request (commit C-08 -- F-002, F-003, F-032).
  2. Stamp the three lifecycle timestamps that ``load_user`` and
     ``fresh_login_required`` consult on every authenticated request
     (commit C-10 -- F-006, F-035, F-045).

Lifecycle timestamps
--------------------

Each authenticated session carries three timestamps in the signed
session cookie:

  * ``_session_created_at`` (``SESSION_CREATED_AT_KEY``) -- the moment
    the session was established (or refreshed after a credential
    change).  ``load_user`` rejects the session if this value is
    strictly older than the database-side
    ``users.session_invalidated_at``, which is how
    :func:`invalidate_other_sessions` makes parallel sessions
    self-terminate.

  * ``_session_last_activity_at``
    (``SESSION_LAST_ACTIVITY_KEY``) -- the moment of the most
    recent authenticated request.  Refreshed automatically by the
    ``before_request`` hook in ``app/__init__.py`` on every request
    where ``current_user.is_authenticated`` is True; ``load_user``
    rejects the session when the gap to ``now()`` exceeds
    ``IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`` (F-006).

  * ``_fresh_login_at`` (``FRESH_LOGIN_AT_KEY``) -- the moment of the
    most recent password (or password+TOTP) verification.  The
    :func:`~app.utils.auth_helpers.fresh_login_required` decorator
    uses this to gate high-value operations: any value older than
    ``FRESH_LOGIN_MAX_AGE_MINUTES`` redirects to ``/reauth`` (F-045).
    Set on initial login, on the password leg of MFA verify, on
    successful ``/reauth``, and on ``change_password`` -- every code
    path that requires the user to type a password.

The three keys are deliberately distinct.  An idle-but-not-stale
session can still complete a benign GET (``_session_last_activity_at``
keeps refreshing as the user clicks around), but a high-value POST
will demand a re-auth even on an actively-used session if more than
``FRESH_LOGIN_MAX_AGE_MINUTES`` have passed since the last password
entry.

Stamping helpers
----------------

The three ``stamp_*`` helpers below own the only writes to those
keys outside ``load_user`` / the ``before_request`` hook.  Each maps
to a single semantic event so the caller cannot accidentally write
the wrong subset:

  * :func:`stamp_login_session` -- new login (password POST,
    successful MFA verify, password change).  Writes all three keys.

  * :func:`stamp_reauth_session` -- ``/reauth`` success on an
    existing session.  Writes activity + fresh; ``_session_created_at``
    stays at its original value so any earlier session that pre-dates
    a future ``invalidate_other_sessions`` call still gets caught.

  * :func:`stamp_session_refresh` -- ``/invalidate-sessions`` where
    the user did not actually re-authenticate.  Writes created +
    activity; ``_fresh_login_at`` stays untouched so a stale
    fresh-login window does not silently extend.

Invalidate-other-sessions mechanism
-----------------------------------

The user record carries ``session_invalidated_at``, a timezone-aware
column updated whenever the user's other sessions must be terminated.
On every request, ``load_user`` in ``app/__init__.py`` rejects any
session whose cookie-side ``_session_created_at`` is strictly older
than the database-side ``session_invalidated_at``.

``invalidate_other_sessions`` writes a single ``now`` timestamp to
both fields atomically (commit, then refresh the cookie), so:

  * Every other live session for the user has a strictly older
    ``_session_created_at`` and is rejected on its next request.
  * The session making this request has ``_session_created_at`` equal
    to ``session_invalidated_at`` -- the strict less-than comparison
    in ``load_user`` is False, so the current session survives.

Caller contract for :func:`invalidate_other_sessions`
-----------------------------------------------------

  * The caller must have already committed any state change that
    motivates the invalidation (password hash update, MFA disable,
    backup-code list mutation).  The helper commits its own write
    of ``session_invalidated_at`` and would inadvertently flush any
    in-flight session state with it.

  * The helper requires an active Flask request context because it
    refreshes the session cookie via ``flask.session``.  Calling it
    outside a request context is a programming error -- it will
    surface as a ``RuntimeError`` from Flask, not a silent no-op.

  * The helper assumes ``user`` is the same identity authenticated on
    the current request.  Passing a different user would invalidate
    that user's sessions but refresh the WRONG cookie -- the caller's
    session would still be rejected on the next request.  Documented
    here rather than enforced at runtime: ``flask_login.current_user``
    is a request-local proxy and importing it into this module would
    couple the helper to the auth blueprint's request lifecycle for
    no defensive gain.

"""The ONE way the migration chain runs on a caller's connection.

Plan step ``balance:X-cv``, rulings **R-BAL114** (one runner) and **R-BAL120**
(its home is here).

**One spelling of "run the migrations".**  The deploy
(``scripts/init_database.py``, entrypoint step 3) and the test-template build
(``scripts/build_test_template.py``) both run the chain through this module, on
a connection they hand over inside a transaction they opened, and nothing here
commits it.  So every template build -- every CI run -- pushes the whole chain
through the path a deploy takes, and a migration that cannot run inside a
caller's transaction fails the template build on the day it is written instead
of failing a release: one PostgreSQL refuses inside a transaction block
(``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY``) or one that asks Alembic for an
``autocommit_block`` (whose ``assert self._transaction is not None`` fires on a
transaction Alembic did not begin).  A migration that COMMITS the connection
itself (``op.get_bind().commit()``, or ``COMMIT`` sent as SQL) does not fail
there -- it commits early -- and ``scripts/init_database.py`` states the census
that finds none.  ``flask db`` is the one runner that is not this one:
``migrations/env.py`` opens and commits a connection of its own when none is
handed over.

**Alembic's shared-connection recipe.**  ``Config.attributes["connection"]``
tells ``migrations/env.py`` to configure the migration context on that
connection.  The connection is in a transaction, so Alembic treats it as
EXTERNAL (``MigrationContext._in_external_transaction``): it neither begins nor
commits one, and the migrations and the stamp commit or roll back with the
caller's own work.  **This module never commits, whatever the caller hands
over**: Alembic begins and COMMITS a transaction of its own only on a
connection that has none, so a connection outside a transaction is put inside
one first (:func:`_config`), and it is the caller's to commit or discard.  A
caller that never commits loses the migrations with its connection, which is
SQLAlchemy 2.0's own rule for work it did not commit.

**Paths resolve from the repository root**, not the working directory:
``alembic.ini`` and ``migrations/`` sit beside ``app/`` in the checkout and in
the image, and a test process need not run from either.

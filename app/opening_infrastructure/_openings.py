"""The OPENINGS side: both predicates, and the dispatcher that asks them.

A restatement is graded from this direction -- given the books' new day, do
they still hold everything the account records?  Both arms' predicates live
here TOGETHER, which is deliberate: they are one rule over two row sets, and
the module docstring's argument that a reader must see them side by side is
the same one :mod:`app.services.cash_ledger._books` makes for its refusals.

The trigger on ``budget.account_openings`` is DISPATCH -- it names the accounts
an event could have changed the books of -- and the predicates it asks are the
ones the INSTALLING revision declared, which is why its body is generated
rather than fixed (:func:`_create_opening_func_sql`).

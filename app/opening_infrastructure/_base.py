"""The BASE of the books boundary: the comparison, and which opening governs.

Arm-independent, because every arm's predicate asks both of these.  They are
installed whatever a caller declares and they survive an arm's withdrawal,
which is what lets a downgrade restore BEHAVIOUR without keeping a frozen copy
of the previous function bodies -- see
:func:`~app.opening_infrastructure.apply_opening_functions`.

This file also holds the ARM VOCABULARY a revision declares itself with.  The
package docstring (:mod:`app.opening_infrastructure`) carries the argument
these definitions only implement.

#: The MOVEMENT arm: a settled row may not be dated on or before its account's
#: opening.  Installed by revision ``d3b6f1c8a274``, which censuses and repairs
#: the movements already in the way before turning it on.
MOVEMENT_ARM = "movement"

#: The MATCHED-LINE arm: a bank line some match names may not be dated on or
#: before its account's opening.  Installed by revision ``d1f6a83c9e47``, which
#: censuses the matched lines already in the way before turning it on.
MATCHED_LINE_ARM = "matched_line"

#: Every arm this module currently knows how to build, **for the two SCRIPTS
#: that materialise a database at HEAD** and for nothing else.
#:
#: **A MIGRATION names its arms as a literal tuple instead, and that closes the
#: ARM axis -- which is not the same as closing every axis.**  These builders
#: are imported LIVE from ``app/``, so a revision that let the module choose
#: would install whatever it had grown into by the time someone ran it -- and it
#: was measured doing exactly that: with the matched-line arm added and
#: ``d3b6f1c8a274`` still calling the builder unqualified, that revision
#: installed ``ck_matched_line_after_books_open`` and
#: ``ck_line_day_after_books_open`` five revisions before ``d1f6a83c9e47`` runs
#: the census that decides whether the rows already there can satisfy them.
#: (Observed on a clone stopped at ``c9f4b1e78d02``, which is one revision
#: before the census; the five is the span from ``d3b6f1c8a274``, where the arm
#: goes in.)  A constraint installed ahead of its census is the failure this arc
#: names as its own root cause (finding **N-400**), reached from the migration
#: side.
#:
#: **What this does NOT close: the BODY axis.**  A revision still reads
#: :data:`GOVERNING_ORDER_SQL` and every ``_CREATE_*`` body live, so a shipped
#: revision installs today's definitions rather than its own.  That is load
#: bearing and unfixed: ``d3b6f1c8a274`` interpolates
#: :data:`GOVERNING_ORDER_SQL`, so it now installs ``id DESC`` four revisions
#: before ``c9f4b1e78d02`` -- the revision whose whole purpose is to introduce
#: that ordering -- while ``c9f4b1e78d02``'s downgrade still restores the frozen
#: ``created_at DESC, id DESC`` its own docstring calls known-broken.  A
#: downgrade past it therefore installs an ordering the database never had.
#: Reported rather than fixed here (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 6): it predates this step
#: and the remedy is the same arm-explicit treatment applied to bodies, which is
#: a step of its own.
#:
#: The name is deliberately not something a revision would reach for: a
#: revision declares, a script materialises.
ALL_ARMS = (MOVEMENT_ARM, MATCHED_LINE_ARM)

#: The governing-row lookup, stated ONCE in SQL so every trigger below reads
#: "which opening record governs" the same way -- and the same way
#: ``cash_ledger.account_opening_fact`` reads it in Python.  The order is
#: :data:`GOVERNING_ORDER_SQL`, whose own note records why it lost its
#: ``created_at`` term at plan step X-f3c-2b-2a: the table is append-only and
#: the latest restatement governs (ruling **R-HE**).
_OPENED_ON_FUNCTION = "budget.account_books_opened_on"

#: THE COMPARISON, in SQL, so this tier states it exactly once -- the same
#: move :data:`_OPENED_ON_FUNCTION` makes for "which opening governs", and for
#: its reason.  ``cash_ledger.books_hold`` is the Python half; between them the
#: rule ruling **R-HG** turns on (``>``, not ``>=``) is stated ONCE PER TIER
#: rather than in one Python function and five hand-typed PL/pgSQL predicates.
#:
#: **"In two places" would be the wrong count, and the exception is worth
#: naming rather than rounding off**: revision ``d3b6f1c8a274`` spells the same
#: rule three more times in live SQL (``m.earliest <= g.opened_on`` in
#: ``_ACCOUNTS_TO_RESTATE``, the same predicate again inside
#: ``_DECLARED_OPENINGS_IN_THE_WAY``, and the ``(m.earliest - 1)::date`` that
#: encodes the same reading as day arithmetic).  Those are the CENSUS and
#: REPAIR queries of the revision that installs this function, so they cannot
#: ask it -- it does not exist until they have run.  The claim this constant
#: can make is about the trigger tier, which is what it is now worded as.
#:
#: **It was five before plan step balance:X-f3c-2b-2b's own adversarial review
#: found them**, and three of those five were that step's: the module's Python
#: twin carried a docstring claiming the comparison was "stated once" while
#: the step added open-coded copies one file over.  ``IMMUTABLE`` and
#: ``LANGUAGE sql`` so the planner inlines it, which is what makes using it in
#: a per-row trigger free.
_BOOKS_HOLD_FUNCTION = "budget.books_hold"

_OPENINGS_TABLE = "budget.account_openings"

#: The RECORDING order that decides which opening record governs (ruling
#: **R-HE**): the table is append-only and the latest restatement wins.  Public
#: because the revision's three window functions, this module's own
#: ``budget.account_books_opened_on`` and
#: ``cash_ledger.governing_account_opening`` must all break it the same way; a
#: fourth spelling is how two tiers come to disagree about which restatement is
#: in force.
#:
#: **It is ``id`` ALONE, and it was ``created_at DESC, id DESC`` until plan step
#: X-f3c-2b-2a's adversarial review refuted the reason for the first term.**
#: That reason -- stated in this module and twice in ``cash_ledger`` -- was that
#: ``created_at`` is set on INSERT and so is monotone in recording order.  It is
#: not: :class:`app.models.mixins.CreatedAtMixin` defaults it to
#: ``db.func.now()``, which in PostgreSQL is ``transaction_timestamp()`` -- the
#: instant the transaction BEGAN.  ``anchor_service._governing_loan_anchor``
#: already says so in as many words about the loan twin, and this door never
#: carried the implication across.  **The failure it produced is a SILENT NO-OP
#: on the level every balance rests on**: two restatements from two tabs, the
#: one whose transaction opened EARLIER commits SECOND under the owner's write
#: lock, and its row sorts below the row it was meant to supersede -- so the
#: owner is told "Books restated" and nothing moved.
#:
#: ``id`` is a sequence value allocated when the INSERT executes, and the write
#: door holds ``lock_user_writes`` across its compare-and-append, so within an
#: account the id order IS the order the owner made the statements.  The
#: migration writes every row in one transaction and at most one per account,
#: so it is unaffected either way.

"""Shared definitions for the account-books boundary's database-tier constraint.

**An account's opening equity is the balance at the CLOSE of its
``opened_on``** (plan step X-f3c-2b, ruling **balance:R-HG**) -- exactly the
rule ``account_anchor_history.observed_on`` states for a balance assertion
(ruling R-DH (a)).  A cash movement dated ON OR BEFORE that day is therefore
already inside the figure, and recording it counts the money twice: the fold
seeds at the opening and ``cash_ledger.dated_deltas`` emits every source at its
own day, so the running total carries it a second time until the next assertion
resets it -- and on a MODELLED account (ruling **R-FO**) the correction that
resets it books to ``unrealized_change``, turning a transfer into market
performance that never unwinds (finding **N-378**).

**This module is what makes that state UNSTORABLE BY ANY SINGLE TRANSACTION,
rather than merely refused.**  Two limits are worth naming rather than leaving
a reader to assume more:

* Under READ COMMITTED two CONCURRENT transactions -- one recording a movement,
  one restating the books past it -- each see a snapshot without the other's
  uncommitted row, so both predicates pass.  **Neither trigger takes a lock,
  and what closes the window instead is that both DOORS take the owner's**
  (:func:`app.services.user_write_lock.lock_user_writes`), which was true of
  the movement side before there was a restatement door and is true of
  :func:`app.services.opening_service.stage_account_opening` by construction.
  The loser blocks until the winner's transaction ENDS, and a deferred
  constraint trigger runs at COMMIT -- after that block, on a fresh READ
  COMMITTED snapshot -- so it sees the winner's committed row and refuses.
  **Measured 2026-08-31 on a production clone rather than argued**: the settle
  path emits ``pg_advisory_xact_lock`` at statement 11 of the 13 an ordinary
  settle runs, inside ``account_posting_service.self_heal_anchor_corrections``,
  and ``reconcile_service.record_settled_days`` reaches the same lock through
  ``_post_stamped_purchases`` -> ``posting_service.sync_transaction_postings``.
  **The residue, stated rather than rounded off:** that self-heal returns
  BEFORE its lock when the source emitted no posting delta, so a movement whose
  legs all net to zero races a restatement unserialised.  ``SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE`` on the governing opening remains the fix that would not depend on a
  second door's locking, and it is a fix for that residue rather than for the
  whole window.
* ``session_replication_role = replica`` disables constraint triggers outright,
  which is what ``pg_restore --disable-triggers`` sets.  The prod-to-dev clone
  is a documented workflow here, so a restore can land rows this module would
  have refused; the CONSTRAINT is not re-validated afterwards, only future
  writes are.

The invariant spans FIVE tables and two directions, so PostgreSQL cannot
state it as a row-level CHECK:

* a MOVEMENT may not move back past its account's opening
  (``budget.transactions`` and ``budget.transaction_entries``, both of which
  carry ``account_id`` and ``settled_on``);
* a MATCHED BANK LINE may not be dated on or before its account's opening
  (plan step **balance:X-f3c-2b-2b**).  **This is not implied by the movement
  rule and the difference is a money defect**: a match settles every member on
  the LATEST of its bank days, so a group holding one pre-opening line and one
  later line settles after the books open and passes the movement arm
  untouched -- while the earlier line's money is inside the opening equity and
  inside a settled row at once.  Measured on a restored production clone
  2026-08-31: lines of 2026-03-26 (``-$15.96``) and 2026-08-17 (``-$64.04``)
  matched to one ``$80.00`` envelope against books opening 2026-03-26 at
  ``$689.16``, accepted.

  **It takes TWO attachments, and the second is what makes the claim above
  true.**  The FACT lives on ``budget.statement_match_members`` and the DAY on
  ``budget.bank_statement_lines``, so either can move without the other -- and
  a trigger on the members table alone left
  ``UPDATE budget.bank_statement_lines SET posted_on = '2020-01-01'`` on an
  already-matched line committing cleanly into the forbidden state.  Found by
  adversarial design review 2026-08-31, against the very paragraph above that
  claims no client can store it.  The movement arm has no such hole because
  ``settled_on`` sits on the table its trigger is attached to;
* an account's GOVERNING opening may not sit on or after a movement OR a
  matched line that already exists (``budget.account_openings``) -- stated
  over the rows that survive an event rather than over the row written, so
  restating forward, raw-updating the governing row and DELETING it (which
  promotes an older restatement) are one rule rather than three arms.  **Its
  two predicates are separate functions**, because the two states have
  different repairs -- re-date the movement, or undo the match -- and a
  refusal that names the wrong one sends the owner to a door that will not
  help.

**A FOURTH rule is enforced at the DOOR and deliberately NOT here**, and the
reason is worth stating because this module's whole claim is structural: a
restatement may not move the books past a day the owner has ASSERTED a balance
for (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.reject_books_open_after_an_assertion`,
plan step X-f3c-2b-2a).  It was written as a fourth trigger arm first, and the
suite refused it -- 12 failures and 22 errors, every one raising out of
``assert_account_books_hold_its_movements``.  **The state it forbids is
ROUTINE, and not only in fixtures**: nothing bounds an assertion against its
account's opening, because ``anchor_service.resolve_observation_day`` bounds
``observed_on`` at ``earliest_recordable_day`` and at today and never at
``opened_on`` -- so an owner may back-date an assertion below their own books
through ``accounts.true_up``.  A constraint refusing what existing rows already
hold does not enforce an invariant; it breaks every write on the accounts that
hold it.  Making the STATE illegal needs the assertion door bounded too and the
existing rows legalised, which is a step and not a clause (finding **N-400**).

All of them are cross-table facts, so they live in **deferred constraint
triggers** validating at COMMIT.  Deferral is not incidental: restating an account's
opening forward is legitimate when the movements in the way are being re-dated
or removed in the SAME transaction, which is exactly what the account-10 repair
(**N-379**) does.  An immediate trigger would refuse that by statement order.

**The service layer states the same rule in WORDS, and that pairing is the
established shape here** -- ``ck_transactions_settle_day_needs_a_record`` beside
:func:`app.services.status_seam.reject_settle_day_without_a_record`.
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.reject_movement_before_books_open` is the
sentence a date box gets; this is why a bulk ``UPDATE``, a raw statement, a
psql session or a writer nobody enumerated cannot produce the state anyway.
The bulk writer is not hypothetical: ``reconcile_service.record_settled_days``
stamps a statement's day onto ticked purchases with ``query.update()`` and has
no ORM instance for the service rule to fire on.

FIVE call sites in four files use these builders, exactly as
:mod:`app.audit_infrastructure` and :mod:`app.posting_infrastructure` are used
-- but they do **not** all produce identical infrastructure, and that
difference is deliberate:

1. Each Alembic revision that installs an ARM, naming the arms it declared and
   censused: ``d3b6f1c8a274`` passes ``arms=(MOVEMENT_ARM,)`` AFTER its
   restatement, and ``d1f6a83c9e47`` passes both arms after its own census.  A
   revision names a LITERAL tuple, never :data:`ALL_ARMS` -- see that constant
   for what letting the module choose was measured to cost.
2. A revision that installs NO arm and only re-states function BODIES:
   ``c9f4b1e78d02`` calls :func:`apply_opening_functions` with
   ``arms=(MOVEMENT_ARM,)``, which is the arm set of its own point in history.
   It is the revision :func:`apply_opening_functions` was split out for, and an
   earlier draft of this list omitted it entirely by describing item 1 as
   "each migration that installs an arm".
3. ``scripts/init_database.py``, whose fresh-database path builds the schema
   with ``db.create_all()`` + an Alembic ``stamp`` and so never runs the
   migration chain.  It materialises HEAD, so it passes :data:`ALL_ARMS`.
4. ``scripts/build_test_template.py``, which runs the chain and then RE-applies
   :data:`ALL_ARMS` idempotently so the latest in-code definition wins over
   migration-frozen state.

**The two SCRIPTS build a database at head; a REVISION builds the database its
own point in history describes.**  Conflating those is what let the
matched-line arm go live five revisions before the census that validates it --
see :data:`ALL_ARMS` for the measurement.

**So a from-scratch database and a migrated one agree only while the NEWEST
revision's arm tuple equals** :data:`ALL_ARMS`, because the scripts install the
latter and the chain installs the former.  Nothing about the alembic stamp can
see a disagreement -- it records which revision is head, never which arms ran --
so it is asserted instead, by
``tests/test_models/test_books_boundary_arms.py``.

**A deferred constraint trigger makes DDL on its table illegal until its events
drain, and that is worth knowing before writing the next migration.**
PostgreSQL refuses ``CREATE INDEX`` (and other DDL) on a table carrying pending
trigger events -- "cannot CREATE INDEX ... because it has pending trigger
events" -- so a transaction that WRITES a movement row and then alters that
table fails.  The remedy is ``SET CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE`` before the DDL,
which runs the checks in place rather than deferring them; it is what
``tests/test_scripts/test_integrity_check.py`` and
``tests/test_models/test_clearing_link_schema.py`` do before re-creating an
index and dropping a NOT NULL.

**THE COMMON CASE OF THIS IS GONE, and how it was closed is the point.**  The
movement trigger carries ``WHEN (NEW.settled_on IS NOT NULL)``, which is the
guard that used to be its function's first line.  An early ``RETURN`` in the
body cannot stop an event being QUEUED -- the queue happens at statement time
and the body runs at COMMIT -- so every Projected row this app writes used to
reserve ``budget.transactions`` against DDL for the rest of its transaction.
It cost two CI failures before it was found: ``recurrence:R17``'s
``test_dc06_detects_two_rows_answering_one_occurrence`` on the merge, and two
audit-trigger benchmarks in ``tests/test_performance`` -- a directory
``pytest.ini`` excludes from the ordinary run, so no local suite can see it.
**What remains is a row that really does carry a settle day**, which is the
only kind the rule was ever going to check.

**The case a reader will NOT think of is a MIGRATION**, and it is the norm here
rather than the exception: this project puts one-time backfills in the Alembic
revision that changes the schema, so an revision that alters
``budget.transactions`` or ``budget.transaction_entries`` AND writes movement
rows in the same transaction is the ordinary shape -- and it fails with
``ObjectInUse`` naming the table, not with the message
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.reject_movement_before_books_open` gives.
Order the DDL first, or drain with ``SET CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE``.  The same property has
been true of ``ck_account_postings_balanced`` since it shipped; this module
states it because a second deferred trigger makes it twice as likely to be met.

**Caller contract: all FIVE tables must already exist**, and that now includes
``budget.bank_statement_lines`` -- ``apply_opening_functions`` creates a body
naming it.

**The contract is MOSTLY the CALLER's to keep, and the claim that the server
kept it was false.**  This paragraph used to say ``check_function_bodies``
validates the table references at ``CREATE FUNCTION`` time, so applying early
"fails loudly".  That is true only for ``LANGUAGE sql`` bodies.  PL/pgSQL's
validator parses its body but does not resolve the table and function
references inside its statements; those resolve on first EXECUTION.  Measured
2026-08-31 with ``check_function_bodies`` ON, the two spellings differ:
``CREATE FUNCTION f() RETURNS void AS $$ BEGIN PERFORM 1 FROM
budget.no_such_table; END $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql`` **succeeds**, while the same
reference in a ``LANGUAGE sql`` body **errors** with ``relation ... does not
exist``.

So the five tables split into two groups, and saying which is the point:

* ``budget.account_openings`` IS checked.  :data:`_CREATE_OPENED_ON_SQL` is
  ``LANGUAGE sql STABLE`` and selects from it, so applying this module without
  that table fails loudly at the second statement -- the right signal.
* ``budget.transactions``, ``budget.transaction_entries``,
  ``budget.statement_match_members`` and ``budget.bank_statement_lines`` are
  NOT.  Every body naming them is ``plpgsql``, so applying early succeeds
  silently and surfaces later as a missing relation raised out of a deferred
  trigger at COMMIT -- the failure mode furthest from its cause, and the one
  this module argues twice that it exists to avoid.

*The correction above needed correcting: its first draft said every body here
is plpgsql "except ``budget.books_hold``, which names no table", which
overlooked that ``budget.account_books_opened_on`` is also ``LANGUAGE sql`` AND
names a table.  A correction that is itself wrong is the defect it was
replacing.*

The statement ORDER inside :func:`apply_opening_functions` (a predicate before
the dispatcher that ``PERFORM``s it) is held by this sentence alone.  Since
plpgsql does not resolve a ``PERFORM`` target at ``CREATE`` time either, both
orders in fact produce a working database today; the order is kept because a
reader should not have to know that, and because it is the order that would
survive either function being rewritten in ``LANGUAGE sql``.
:mod:`app.posting_infrastructure` and :mod:`app.append_only_infrastructure`
carry the same belief in their own docstrings and are out of this step's scope
(``CLAUDE.md`` rule 6) -- reported, not fixed.

    """Make the account-books boundary equal exactly *arms*.

    **It states the boundary TOTALLY rather than additively**, and that is the
    property the rest of this design rests on: an arm the caller does not name
    is DROPPED -- its triggers, then its functions -- not merely left alone.
    So one call materialises a database's whole boundary, and a downgrade that
    removes an arm is the same call naming one fewer.  ``d1f6a83c9e47``'s
    downgrade is exactly that, and it is why that revision keeps no frozen copy
    of the previous function bodies: there is nothing to keep in step by hand,
    because the bodies are regenerated from this module for the arms that
    remain.

    Executes, in order: the two BASE functions and the declared arms' functions
    (:func:`apply_opening_functions`), then each declared arm's constraint
    triggers, then the openings trigger, then the drops for every arm NOT
    declared.  Every statement is idempotent (``CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION``
    swaps the body; ``DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS`` + ``CREATE`` re-pins each
    trigger; every drop is ``IF EXISTS``), so a second run with the same arms
    is indistinguishable from the first.

    **Triggers are dropped before the functions they name.**  Every arm's
    ``DROP TRIGGER`` runs above, in the same pass, before its
    ``DROP FUNCTION`` -- and the openings dispatcher is REGENERATED without the
    withdrawn arm's predicate (by :func:`apply_opening_functions`) before that
    predicate is dropped.  Dropping a routine a stored function still names is
    legal in PostgreSQL and fails at CALL time, which would leave every
    restatement raising ``function does not exist`` on a database that reported
    a clean apply.

    **The caller must have LEGALISED the data for the arms it names.**  Applying
    an arm to a database whose existing rows violate it does not fail here -- a
    constraint trigger validates writes, not existing rows -- but the next
    write touching such a row aborts at COMMIT.  Each revision therefore
    censuses (and, where there is a safe automatic repair, restates) BEFORE

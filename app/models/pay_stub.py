"""
Shekel Budget App -- Pay Stub Models (salary schema)

A real PAY STUB, TRANSCRIBED line by line and dated (plan step **salary:S11-a**,
the tables leaf of ``S11``; ruling **R-SAL42**, which amends **R-SAL41** and
**R-SAL9**).  Four tables, one per kind of thing a stub prints (round 4, fork
11: "a table per kind of line"):

    salary.pay_stubs               one row per stub: its payday, base pay, the
                                   "Use for pricing" switch
    salary.pay_stub_line_amounts   what the stub shows for one PAYCHECK LINE
    salary.pay_stub_withholdings   what the stub shows for one TAX
    salary.pay_stub_one_offs       a named amount the paycheck lines do not hold

**Every column of the three child tables is required**, so a row that is two
things at once -- a paycheck line's amount that is also a tax, a one-off with no
kind -- cannot exist, and neither can a duplicate WITHIN a table: one amount per
paycheck line, one per tax, one one-off per name, each per stub.  The ruling's
own words were "Every column is required, so a row that is two things at once
or a duplicate can't exist"; **a duplicate ACROSS tables is not structural** --
a one-off named like one of the profile's paycheck lines, or like a tax, is
storable -- and ruling **R-SAL45** assigns it to the entry door (``S11-b``),
which refuses a one-off whose name matches a paycheck line or a tax ("enter it
on the line instead") beside its printed-net check.

**What is NOT stored, and why.**  Gross, taxable wages and net pay are DERIVED
from the lines (rule 14); the printed net is typed once at the entry door as a
check against the lines and never kept.  A line amount carries no KIND: the kind
is the paycheck line's, and a second copy of it here would be a second home.

**Nothing here is ever deleted** (fork 8a', "Nothing is ever deleted"), and since
ruling **R-SAL44** that holds for every routine writer, not only for the absence
of a delete door (a superuser disabling triggers is the named limit, in
:mod:`app.pay_stub_infrastructure`).  A stub the owner no longer wants pricing is switched off
(``use_for_pricing``), kept, and still editable.  Three guards:

* **The stub row** -- a trigger family (:mod:`app.pay_stub_infrastructure`)
  refuses a ``DELETE`` of a stub, a change of its ``salary_profile_id`` and
  (ruling **R-SAL46**) a ``TRUNCATE`` of any of the four tables.  Payday,
  base pay, the switch, notes and every line stay editable; removing one line
  is a row ``DELETE`` and stays allowed (and audited).
* **What holds a stub** -- ``pay_stubs.salary_profile_id`` is ``ON DELETE
  RESTRICT``, not the ``CASCADE`` :class:`~app.models.mixins.SalaryProfileScopedMixin`
  carries, so a profile holding a stub cannot be hard-deleted, and nor,
  through the profile's own cascade from its user, can the owner (the salary
  door ARCHIVES a profile and never deletes one).
* **What a stub holds** -- a line amount's paycheck line is ``ON DELETE
  RESTRICT`` (fork 10: "Deleting a paycheck line that any stub names is refused
  ... end it instead"), so a line a stub names outlives its end.

The child tables' stub keys ``CASCADE`` (a line of a stub is part of it), which
runs only under a deliberate lift of the trigger family.

**Trigger order decides nothing.**  A profile delete reaches a stub two ways --
through the stub's own key, and through the paycheck line's cascade from the
profile -- and ruling **R-CC32** states the principle: a delete's outcome must
not depend on which path PostgreSQL evaluates first.  The stub key's
``RESTRICT`` refuses at the first level, so the refusal names it; and the
trigger family's ``DELETE`` arm fires on a cascaded delete of a stub like any
other, so even a ``CASCADE`` on that key would be refused rather than let order
decide (measured by this leaf's second review, in both orders).

**A stub's line is its own profile's, by key.**  A line amount carries the stub's
``salary_profile_id`` as a co-located key column, held equal to the stub's by
``fk_pay_stub_line_amounts_pay_stub`` (onto ``uq_pay_stubs_id_profile``) and to
the paycheck line's by ``fk_pay_stub_line_amounts_paycheck_line`` (onto
``uq_paycheck_lines_id_profile``).  So a stub cannot name another job's line, or
another owner's, whatever a writer passes.  It is the construction
``fk_transaction_entries_owner_transaction`` / ``_owner_account`` use (ruling
**R-BAL76**): a key the database keeps true instead of a copy a writer keeps in
step.

No door writes these tables yet: the entry door is ``S11-b`` and the engine that
prices from them is ``S11-c``.  This leaf moves ``$0.00``.

class PayStub(OptimisticLockMixin, TimestampMixin, db.Model):
    """One real pay stub of one salary profile, dated at its payday.

    Columns:

      ``payday``          -- the stub's date, which the entry door requires to be
          one of the owner's paydays.  UNIQUE per profile (fork 4, "One stub per
          payday per job"): entering a date again OPENS that stub for editing
          (ruling **R-SAL50**), a new stub on a held payday is refused rather
          than let overwrite it (**R-SAL52**), and the audit log keeps every
          edit's old figures.  A DATE and not a pay-period key, because
          the date is the document's own fact and a pay period is a row the pay
          calendar may regenerate.
      ``base_pay``        -- the base pay line the stub prints.  Required and
          above zero.  It feeds only the DIFFERENCE the formulas price; the
          paycheck's own base pay keeps its one home in the salary and its
          raises (fork 5, "The app's salary").
      ``use_for_pricing`` -- the "Use for pricing" switch, on when entered (fork
          8a').  Off keeps the stub and prices every paycheck, past and future,
          as if it had never been entered.  A named column rather than
          :class:`~app.models.mixins.IsActiveMixin`'s ``is_active``, whose meaning
          is "stops driving new work while its history stays valid": this switch
          reaches backward too.
      ``notes``           -- free text.  Nullable: a stub needs no annotation to
          be valid.

    ``salary_profile_id`` is declared here rather than taken from
    :class:`~app.models.mixins.SalaryProfileScopedMixin`, whose ``CASCADE`` this
    table must not have (see the module docstring).  It never changes after the
    stub is entered: the trigger family refuses a move.

    ``version_id`` is :class:`~app.models.mixins.OptimisticLockMixin`'s, and
    **it guards THIS ROW only**.  SQLAlchemy bumps it when the stub row itself is
    updated, never for an edit to a line amount, a withholding or a one-off
    alone (measured by this leaf's adversarial review: a child-only edit left it
    at ``1``).  So two concurrent line-only edits both commit and the later
    silently wins, unless the entry door (``S11-b``) writes the stub row on
    every edit of its lines -- which is what makes its ``StaleDataError`` guard
    cover the stub as one act.

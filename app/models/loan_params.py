"""
Shekel Budget App -- Loan Parameters Model (budget schema)

Stores loan configuration for all installment loan types: principal,
rate, term, payment day, and optional ARM fields.  One row per
amortizing account, linked one-to-one via account_id.

E-18 / Commit 15 demoted ``current_principal`` and ``interest_rate``
from authoritative storage to non-authoritative seed columns, and both
are GONE.  DH-#56 completed the OPT-1 drop for ``interest_rate``: the
loan's base / period-0 rate lives in its origination
:class:`RateHistory` row (``create_params`` seeds one for every loan;
the DH-#56 migration backfilled pre-existing loans).  Plan step
``recurrence:R20`` (ruling **R-R72** part 3, finding **REC-519**)
dropped ``current_principal``: the balance the owner states at setup is
a dated ASSERTION and is recorded as one -- a ``tracking_start``
:class:`LoanAnchorEvent` the setup door appends in the same transaction
as this row -- where the column held it as a value nothing read.  The
loan resolver (``app/services/loan_resolver``) derives the displayed
current balance from the latest :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` plus the
confirmed payment stream, and derives the current applicable rate from
the :class:`RateHistory` series.  Display and money surfaces (loan
dashboard card, /savings debt card, /savings account card, year-end
net-worth liability, debt strategy) read the resolver's
``state.current_rate`` and the ``balance_at`` seam's folded balance,
never a stored scalar.  The origination anchor is synthesized from
``original_principal`` and ``origination_date``, the two immutable
figures this row still carries.

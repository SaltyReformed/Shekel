Shekel Budget App -- Ledger Account Model (budget schema)

The chart of accounts for the double-entry posting ledger (Build-Order
Step 2; extended with the per-category cash chart in Step 3, the per-loan
interest / escrow / refund accounts in Step 4, the per-loan opening-equity
account in the loan read switch, and the per-account anchor-equity account
in Step 5).  Every posting leg
(``budget.account_postings``) lands in exactly one ledger account, and every
ledger account carries a ``class_id`` fixing how a reader later interprets
that account's accumulated debit-positive posting balance (Asset/Expense are
debit-normal; Liability/Income/Equity are credit-normal -- see
:class:`app.models.ref.LedgerAccountClass`).

**The explicit row-kind discriminator (``kind_id``).**  Every row carries a
NOT NULL ``kind_id`` FK to :class:`app.models.ref.LedgerAccountKind` that
names its kind *positively* -- a reader branches on that integer ID, never
on which of ``account_id`` / ``category_id`` / ``is_fallback`` /
``loan_account_id`` happen to be NULL.  ``kind_id`` is the authoritative
discriminator; it is stamped by the sole writer (``ledger_account_service``)
on exactly the same trust contract ``class_id`` carries (see "Storage-tier
shape enforcement" below for what the constraints do and do not police).
Eleven kinds coexist in one table:

* **linked** (``account_id`` set, ``category_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback``
  False, ``loan_account_id`` NULL) -- one per real ``budget.accounts`` row,
  created by the account-create sync hook (``ledger_account_service``) and by
  the Step-2 backfill migration.  ``name`` is ``NULL`` and the display label
  derives from the live ``account.name`` via the relationship.  Every such
  row is Asset or Liability (derived from the account-type category:
  Liability category -> Liability class; Asset, Retirement, and Investment
  categories -> Asset class).
* **category** (``account_id`` NULL, ``category_id`` set, ``is_fallback``
  False, ``loan_account_id`` NULL) -- one Income or Expense ledger account
  per budget category per accounting class: the per-category chart of
  accounts the cash-posting step (Build-Order Step 3) books an ordinary
  transaction's counter-leg into.  ``name`` snapshots the category's
  ``display_name`` ("Group: Item") at creation, so renaming the budgeting
  category never rewrites posted history; the ``category_id`` link still
  enables live reporting grouping while the category exists.  A ``Category``
  is type-agnostic, so a category used for both an income and an expense
  transaction correctly yields two rows -- one per class.
* **fallback** (``account_id`` NULL, ``category_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback``
  True, ``loan_account_id`` NULL) -- the per-user ``Uncategorized Income`` /
  ``Uncategorized Expense`` buckets (exactly one per owner per class) that
  catch a settled transaction whose ``category_id`` is NULL.  ``name``
  carries the canonical label.  The ``is_fallback`` flag is what marks a
  row as *the* fallback.
* **orphan** (``account_id`` NULL, ``category_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback``
  False, ``loan_account_id`` NULL) -- a former **category** row whose budget
  category was later deleted: ``category_id`` is SET NULL but the row, its
  ``name`` snapshot, and its immutable postings persist (a permanent,
  now-inactive chart entry -- the accounting analogue of a retired expense
  account).  Orphans are deliberately NOT unique: any number coexist with one
  another and with the fallback of the same class.
* **loan_interest** / **loan_escrow** / **loan_refund** (``loan_account_id``
  set, ``account_id`` NULL, ``category_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback`` False) --
  the three per-loan accounts the Step-4 loan-payment correction books into:
  the loan's accrued-interest Expense account, its configured-escrow Expense
  account, and its payoff-overpayment refund Asset account.  ``name``
  snapshots a per-loan label naming the loan and the component; at most one
  of each kind exists per loan (``uq_ledger_accounts_loan``).
* **equity_opening** (``loan_account_id`` set, ``account_id`` NULL,
  ``category_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback`` False) -- the loan's opening-balance
  Equity account: the credit counter-leg of the once-per-loan opening-equity
  entry the loan read switch (Build-Order Step 4, second half) books at
  origination so the ledger is authoritative for the loan's confirmed balance.
  It shares the per-loan column shape and the ``uq_ledger_accounts_loan``
  unique with the three correction accounts above, differing only in class
  (Equity) and in what books it (the opening entry, not the payment
  correction).  ``name`` snapshots a per-loan "<loan> -- Opening" label.
* **anchor_equity** / **interest_income** / **unrealized_change**
  (``account_id`` set, ``category_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback`` False,
  ``loan_account_id`` NULL) -- the three per-account COUNTER accounts a
  NON-loan account's balance assertions book their counter-leg into: the
  balanced ``account_opening`` / ``account_trueup`` corrections make every
  non-loan linked ledger sum to an ABSOLUTE balance, and WHICH of the three
  takes the counter leg says what the difference WAS (ruling **R-FO**, plan
  step X-f3d) -- ``anchor_equity`` is Equity and books the correction that
  opens the account's books plus every ``PLAIN`` true-up, ``interest_income``
  is Income, and ``unrealized_change`` is the ``Unrealized`` class.  All three
  share the account-linked column *shape* with **linked** (the shape CHECKs
  cannot tell them apart; ``kind_id`` does, on the sole-writer trust
  contract), coexisting with the linked row and with each other under the
  ``(account_id, kind_id)`` key of ``uq_ledger_accounts_account_kind`` --
  which is why R-FO's two kinds needed no new index.  Unlike a linked row
  each ALWAYS carries a ``name`` snapshot ("<account> -- Opening",
  "-- Interest Income", "-- Change in Value"): the COALESCE display
  rule below is the LINKED-row rule, so a reader rendering a counter row
  branches on ``kind_id`` and uses the snapshot, never ``account.name``.

**Why ``is_fallback`` exists.**  A fallback and an orphan are BOTH
``(account_id NULL, category_id NULL)`` -- nothing in those two columns
tells them apart.  Without a discriminator, a per-(owner, class) singleton
over the NULL/NULL space would (a) forbid a second retired category of a
class, and worse (b) make a category delete's ``category_id`` SET NULL
*fail at the database* the moment the orphan it produces lands on an
existing fallback of that class -- the SET NULL is part of the DELETE, so
the whole category delete would raise.  ``is_fallback`` confines the
singleton to the true fallback, so a deleted category becomes a
freely-coexisting orphan and the delete always succeeds.

**Storage-tier shape enforcement.**  The constraints keep each row's column
*shape* mutually exclusive and consistent with its kind; the ``kind_id``
value itself is trusted from the sole writer (the same contract ``class_id``
has -- no CHECK pins ``class_id`` to a valid class for the shape either).
``ck_ledger_accounts_account_or_category_null`` forbids setting both
``account_id`` and ``category_id``; ``ck_ledger_accounts_fallback_shape``
forbids ``is_fallback`` on anything but the NULL/NULL shape;
``ck_ledger_accounts_loan_shape`` forbids a ``loan_account_id`` row from also
carrying an ``account_id`` / ``category_id`` / ``is_fallback`` (so a per-loan
row can never also be a linked / category / fallback row); and each
*constrained* kind has its own partial unique index -- one account-linked
row per ``(account, kind)`` (``uq_ledger_accounts_account_kind``: exactly
one ``linked`` row per real account, and at most one of each per-account
COUNTER kind), one
category row per ``(user, category, class)``
(``uq_ledger_accounts_category``), one fallback per ``(user, class)``
(``uq_ledger_accounts_uncategorized``, keyed ``WHERE is_fallback``), and one
per ``(user, loan, kind)`` (``uq_ledger_accounts_loan``, keyed ``WHERE
loan_account_id IS NOT NULL``).  Orphans carry no uniqueness by design.

**Why ``ck_ledger_accounts_loan_shape`` does not pin ``kind_id`` to the loan
kinds.**  A CHECK constraint cannot contain a subquery, so "this row's
``kind_id`` is one of the four loan kinds" is inexpressible without
embedding the seeded ``ref.ledger_account_kinds`` row IDs as literals -- which
the project forbids (ref IDs are resolved through ``ref_cache``, never
hardcoded).  The CHECK therefore policies the column *shape* of a loan row,
and "a loan row's kind is a loan kind" is guaranteed by the sole writer
(``ledger_account_service.get_or_create_loan_ledger_account``, Step 4) and its
tests -- the identical, deliberately-accepted trust contract the (un-CHECKed)
``class_id`` already carries (see ``ledger_account_service``).

**Reconciliation of orphans** (a forward note for Build-Order Step 8's
oracle).  An orphan still holds the immutable postings made while its
category was live, but the transactions that produced them now read
``category_id IS NULL`` (``transactions.category_id`` is itself SET NULL on
category delete).  So the counter-leg reconciliation must follow the
postings' ``transaction_id`` linkage on the journal entries (which row
posted to which ledger account), NOT a ``category_id`` match (the category
is gone): that formulation reconciles an orphan against exactly the
transactions whose legs landed on it, and the fallback against the
still-uncategorized remainder.

The ``name`` column is display-only and is never used for logic
(IDs-for-logic invariant).  The display rule is
``COALESCE(account.name, ledger_account.name)``: a linked row reads the
live account name, a category / fallback / orphan / per-loan row reads its
own snapshot.  **The COALESCE rule is the LINKED-row rule only**: an
per-account COUNTER row also carries ``account_id`` (so the COALESCE would
wrongly resolve to the bare account name), so readers rendering chart
entries branch on ``kind_id`` and use the ``name`` snapshot for those rows
-- the sole writer always stamps one.  Readers do that with a DEFAULT arm
rather than an enumeration, which is why R-FO's two new kinds needed no
edit in ``ledger_report_service._attribution.ledger_account_label``.  The
``ck_ledger_accounts_name_present`` CHECK guarantees at least one of the
two is present so the display rule can never resolve to NULL -- and because
a non-account-linked row has ``account_id`` NULL, that CHECK forces it to
carry a ``name``.

**Write-once, not append-only.**  Rows are created by the sync hook /
backfill and never edited afterwards: ``class_id``, ``kind_id``,
``account_id``, and ``loan_account_id`` are intrinsic, and a linked row's
``name`` stays NULL (the display name lives on ``account.name``).  The table
therefore uses :class:`CreatedAtMixin` (no ``updated_at``).  Unlike the
append-only ledger tables (``journal_entries`` / ``account_postings``) it
carries no ORM immutability guards: a ledger account is a directory entry
that is disposed of -- never corrected -- when its real account is deleted.

**FK-action rationale (the cascade-imbalance impossibility argument).**
``account_id`` is ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` so a freshly-created *empty*
account deletes cleanly, taking its (postings-free) ledger account -- and,
since Step 5, its (equally postings-free) per-account counter rows -- with
it.
An account whose ledger rows *have* postings is instead kept off the
hard-delete path by route **Guard 5** (``archive_helpers.account_has_ledger_postings``
in ``routes/accounts/crud.py``), which joins by ``account_id`` across ALL
kinds -- so it covers the linked row and the anchor-equity twin alike --
and archives (``is_active=False``) any such account rather than deleting
it.  (**A counter row CAN be the lone posting-bearing row, and the parenthetical
here said it could not**: it read "the twin's legs only ever land pairwise
with correction legs on the linked row", which ruling R-FO falsified -- a
correction re-pointed from one counter row to another emits a delta entry
whose linked leg is zero and dropped, so its two legs are both counter legs
and no linked leg exists.  The conclusion survives untouched because Guard 5
was never resting on that premise: it joins by ``account_id`` across ALL
kinds, so it sees a counter row's postings whether or not the linked row has
any.  The premise is corrected rather than deleted because it is what
authorises a DESTRUCTIVE FK action.)  That guard -- not the shadow-transaction
RESTRICT FKs -- is what makes the impossibility hold, because a settled
transfer's postings OUTLIVE the transfer: a transfer hard-delete SET-NULLs
``journal_entries.transfer_id`` but keeps the immutable legs, so once the
shadows are gone the RESTRICT FKs on ``transactions.account_id`` /
``transfers.from|to_account_id`` (``transaction.py`` / ``transfer.py``) no
longer cover the case on their own.  With Guard 5 in front, only a
posting-free account ever reaches the CASCADE, so CASCADE can never orphan a
posting leg; those RESTRICT FKs on any still-live shadows, plus the
``loan_account_id`` RESTRICT below (a loan-correction row survives even with no
settled transaction at all), are the DB-tier second layer.  (Accounts with
history are *archived*, never deleted.)  The relationship to
:class:`~app.models.account.Account` is
deliberately one-directional (no backref): ``Account`` has no awareness
of its ledger account, so deleting an account never triggers an ORM
SET-NULL on the ledger row -- the database-level CASCADE is what removes
the paired row, cleanly.

``class_id`` is ``ON DELETE RESTRICT`` because the seeded
``ref.ledger_account_classes`` rows are non-removable application
invariants: a successful class delete would strand every ledger account
in that class.  ``kind_id`` is ``ON DELETE RESTRICT`` for the same reason:
the seeded ``ref.ledger_account_kinds`` rows are non-removable invariants,
and a kind delete would strand every ledger account of that kind.

``loan_account_id`` is ``ON DELETE RESTRICT``.  It links a per-loan
interest / escrow / refund / opening row to the loan ``budget.accounts`` row
it books against, and is NULL on every other kind.  RESTRICT
(not SET NULL or CASCADE) because such a row accumulates immutable postings:
SET NULL would strand the row's kind (a ``loan_interest`` row with no loan),
and CASCADE would delete a posting-bearing chart entry and orphan its legs
(breaking the per-entry SUM = 0 invariant).  A loan account that has per-loan
ledger rows therefore cannot be deleted -- consistent with "accounts with
history are archived, never deleted," the same disposal contract the linked
``account_id`` CASCADE relies on (that CASCADE is only ever reachable for an
empty, postings-free account; see the impossibility argument above).  Like
``account`` and ``category``, the relationship is one-directional (no backref
on ``Account``), so an account delete never triggers an ORM action on the
ledger row.

``category_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` (the same action
``budget.transactions.category_id`` uses).  A category ledger account
accumulates immutable postings, so the ledger account itself can never be
deleted; when the budgeting category it snapshots is deleted, clearing the
back-link (and keeping the ``name`` snapshot) turns the row into an
**orphan** (``is_fallback`` stays False, so it freely coexists with the
fallback and any other orphans -- see the row-kind taxonomy and the
"Why ``is_fallback`` exists" note above; without that discriminator this
SET NULL would collide with the per-(owner, class) fallback singleton and
abort the category delete).  RESTRICT would wrongly forbid deleting a
category that has posted history.  Like ``account``, the relationship is
one-directional (no backref on ``Category``).

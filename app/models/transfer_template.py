Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Template Model (budget schema)

A template defines a recurring transfer between accounts (e.g. "Monthly
savings contribution") along with its recurrence rule and default amount.
The transfer recurrence engine uses templates to auto-generate Transfer
rows into future pay periods.

Shekel Budget App -- the statement-import models' table arguments, as one value each.

**Born as a MOVE in the commit that also edited two of the four** (plan step
``bank_import:X-f6b-1b``, 2026-09-18, under ruling **balance:R-IR**:
*pylint's 1,000-line module ceiling stays, and the session that breaks a
module is the one that splits it*).  :mod:`app.models.statement_import` stood
at 1,132 lines once the sighting relation gained the merchant key and the line
gained its two sealed projections, so the four ``__table_args__`` tuples came
here on the seam :mod:`app.models._transaction_table_args` established:
``__table_args__`` is the one part of a model that is a VALUE rather than a
declaration, names no attribute the class exposes, is imported by no caller,
and is read by SQLAlchemy exactly once at class construction.  Every other
cut (the columns, the properties, the class docstrings) would have separated
things a reader needs side by side.

**What "moved verbatim" covers, and what it does not, stated against the
tree the commit started from** (``git show <parent>:app/models/statement_import.py``).
``account_external_identity_table_args`` and ``statement_import_table_args``
are byte-for-byte the tuples that stood in the class bodies: ``ast.dump`` of
each equals ``ast.dump`` of the expression it replaced -- identical in KIND,
in ORDER and in every keyword argument, so a drop, a swap, a reworded
predicate and a changed ``ondelete`` are all ruled out at once.
``bank_statement_line_table_args`` and ``statement_line_sighting_table_args``
carry X-f6b-1b's OWN schema edits in the same commit -- the line's
``fk_bank_statement_lines_merchant_account`` and
``idx_bank_statement_lines_account_merchant`` DROPPED (8 members to 6), the
sighting's ``fk_statement_line_sightings_merchant_account`` and
``idx_statement_line_sightings_account_merchant`` ADDED (8 to 10) -- and are
otherwise the same tuples; the AST equality for those two was measured
against the edited class bodies immediately before the move, so the MOVE
changed nothing and the schema change is the model's (rulings **R-BI16**,
**R-BI17**).  *A first draft of this paragraph claimed all four were
verbatim, measured against the working copy rather than the parent commit;
named by adversarial review 2026-09-18.*

The argument for each key, constraint and index stays WITH it, in the comments
below.  The models that read these values:
:class:`~app.models.statement_import.AccountExternalIdentity`,
:class:`~app.models.statement_import.StatementImport`,
:class:`~app.models.statement_import.BankStatementLine` and
:class:`~app.models.statement_import.StatementLineSighting`.

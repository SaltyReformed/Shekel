"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence Rule Model (budget schema)

Defines the pattern by which transactions are auto-generated into
future pay periods (every_period, monthly, annual, etc.).

**This table states its recurrence in SIX columns and carries no second
statement of any of them.**  ``interval_n`` / ``unit_id`` / ``placement_id`` /
``shift_id`` / ``starts_on`` / ``nominal_day`` are what a caller AUTHORS and
what every reader takes; beside them sit only ``due_day_of_month`` -- the
servicer's date for a bill the cadence schedules elsewhere -- and the closing
bound's exclusive arc.

**Seven columns were DROPPED at plan step R7c-c** (migration
``d9f5c1a48b73``), each a derived encoding the write door maintained:
``pattern_id`` (a closed set of eight names for cadences the two axes state
directly), ``day_of_month`` and ``month_of_year`` (the cycle's day and its
residue class, both carried by the first occurrence), ``start_date`` (the
opening bound, which the first occurrence IS), ``start_period_id`` (the
paycheck a rule started in), ``offset_periods`` (the cycle phase, derived from
the first occurrence on every read), and ``interval_n``'s ENCODED value -- the
column held ``1`` for every pattern whose interval was baked into its name, so
a Quarterly rule read as monthly at face value until that migration re-pointed
it.

Plan step R2d (developer ruling, 2026-08-07) refused to store the two-axis
values while they were a DERIVATION over the closed-set columns plus the
owner's schedule, because a stored derivation is a cache and a cache drifts the
moment one writer moves one side alone.  That is not what they are: the form
collects ``starts_on`` and the loan sync writes it from a contract, so there is
no input left for it to lag.  A stored derivation is a cache; a stored authored
value is a fact.  (A day-less LOAN payment is the one shape still measured
against the schedule -- see ``recurrence._authoring._author`` and plan ledger
row **D39**, which plan step R5 owns.)

Ruling **R-R16** is what collapsed the four anchor columns: the first
occurrence is the earliest thing a cadence produces, its day is the cycle's day
and its month is the cycle's month.  Plan ledger row **D28** measured what
keeping them apart would have cost, at 18 of 24 live multi-month rules firing
in the wrong months forever.

``end_date`` and ``max_occurrences`` are ONE authored value above this table
(``app.services.recurrence.EndBound``, plan step R7b-3): the occurrence walk
has read both since plan step R3, and the write door splits the single bound
into this pair on the way in and rejoins it on the way out.  That is what makes
the exclusive arc below structural rather than maintained -- no value in the
application can state two closing bounds, so nothing has to check.

**Every write goes through one door** (:mod:`app.services.recurrence`).  A
caller states what it AUTHORS -- a ``RecurrenceSpec``, never a column -- and
the seam writes the whole spec.  Nothing in ``app/`` or ``scripts/`` constructs
or mutates this model outside that seam.

**A rule is OWNED BY its template, and plan step R-F6 turned that arrow
around.**  The FK used to point from the template to the rule
(``transaction_templates.recurrence_rule_id ON DELETE SET NULL``, and its
transfer twin), which is a satellite referenced by its parent rather than
declaring one -- and three consequences followed from the direction alone:

1. **A hard-deleted template stranded its rule forever** (finding **F-6**).
   ``SET NULL`` fires on the wrong side, so no ``ondelete`` in that direction
   could dispose of the rule; the two hard-delete routes each had to remember,
   and neither did.  Three rows had accumulated on production.
2. **1:1 was unstateable**, so the application carried a runtime census --
   ``_recurrence_form_helpers._rule_is_exclusively_owned`` -- counting the
   templates referencing a rule before daring to delete it, and
   ``scripts/integrity_check`` carried check **OR-02** scanning for the
   orphans afterwards.  Both are DELETED: the arc plus a unique index per arm
   says what they asked.
3. **The rule carried its own ``user_id``**, which the template also carried,
   with nothing tying the two together.  It is a property now
   (:attr:`RecurrenceRule.user_id`), read through the owner, so the pair
   cannot disagree.

The shape is ``budget.template_amount_versions``' exactly (developer,
2026-08-11) -- the OTHER satellite of these same two parents: an exclusive arc
of two nullable typed FKs under one CHECK, ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` on each. The
arc is EXACTLY-one rather than at-most-one, for that table's own reason one
noun over: a cadence nothing repeats is not a cadence.

    # one line down: eager-joined ``budget.pay_periods`` for ZERO readers.
    # ``month_anchor`` went at plan step R7c-c with the table it pointed at
    # (ruling **R-R16**): ``budget.recurrence_month_anchors`` was to hold the
    # clamped day once the anchor became a column, and that day is
    # ``nominal_day`` above instead, under a CHECK tying its presence to
    # meaning.  The counter-argument it settled is worth keeping: a nullable
    # column is a wide sparse table one column at a time UNLESS its absence is
    # the discriminator and its presence is constrained, which
    # ``ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day`` is what makes true here.
    #
    # ``weekday_anchor`` is the ONE 0-or-1 subtype left, it is EMPTY, and it is
    # SCHEDULED FOR DELETION unwritten (ruling **R-R25**, 2026-08-16, plan step
    # **R8-c**).  It was to hold "the third Friday" -- two fields with their own
    # domain, and "the LAST Tuesday" (``nth_week = -1``) is not derivable from a
    # date at all -- and those two fields go on THIS table as an exclusive arc
    # instead, for the reason the ``month_anchor`` paragraph above already
    # gives: a rule fires on a day-of-month OR an nth-weekday, never both, and
    # that invariant is only a CHECK while both facts sit on one row.  This
    # comment claimed it "is a CHECK against ``nominal_day``" with the anchor in
    # another table, which plan step R8-a measured unbuildable -- a PostgreSQL
    # CHECK may reference only columns of the row being checked.
    # ``uselist=False`` because the UNIQUE constraint on its
    # ``recurrence_rule_id`` makes at most one row possible; ``lazy="select"``
    # because nothing reads it and nothing will, so an eager join would cost
    # every rule load for no reader; ``passive_deletes`` defers to the FK's ON
    # DELETE CASCADE rather than loading the child to delete it.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurring-definition amount versions (budget schema)

The effective-dated price history of a recurring definition's amount.  A
transaction template and a transfer template each carry ONE stated amount
(``default_amount``), a scalar with no time dimension: when a subscription's
price rises the old figure is overwritten, so the app cannot say what the
definition cost last March and a price change retroactively rewrites every
past projection.  :class:`TemplateAmountVersion` is that amount as a dated
SERIES instead -- rule 1 of ruling **R-FI**, "every financial quantity that
varies over time is a dated series resolved as-of".

**Supersession, not ranges.**  A version is in effect from its
``effective_date`` until the NEXT version of the same template supersedes it,
so there is no ``end_date`` and two versions of one template can never
overlap -- the same model :class:`~app.models.escrow_line.EscrowComponentVersion`
uses for an escrow line, and for the same reason: an overlapping-range state
that has to be checked is a state that can exist, while an unrepresentable one
cannot.

**The date a version is compared against is the ROW's own due date**, not the
pay period that funds it (developer, 2026-08-11), which is the rule ruling D5
already applies to a loan payment's escrow: a bill's price is a fact about the
day the bill is due.  A recurring definition therefore prices a bill due
2026-09-12 at the version in effect on 2026-09-12, even when the paycheck
funding it runs past a later version's date.

**Before the earliest version the series HOLDS FLAT** -- the resolver
back-projects rather than answering "no amount", which is ruling **R-I**'s shape
on the balance fold applied here.  A template generates rows into historical pay
periods as readily as into future ones, so a partial resolver would refuse to
price a row the app itself created; the honest answer for a date before any
recorded price is the earliest price recorded.  See
:func:`app.services.template_amount_service.amount_as_of`.

**Which definitions have a series, and which must not.**  A version records an
amount somebody STATED.  A template whose amount is DERIVED gets no series at
all, because building a price history over a derived quantity manufactures a
history nobody ever stated: a salary-linked transaction template (the paycheck
calculator prices each row) and a derive-mode loan-payment transfer template
(``default_amount`` is a stored snapshot of P&I plus escrow) are both excluded.
:func:`app.services.template_amount_service.owns_its_amount` is the single
predicate, and :func:`app.services.template_amount_service.set_amount` is the
single write door.

Additive as of plan step **X-au-a**: ``default_amount`` stays authoritative and
nothing prices a row from this table yet.  Plan step **X-au-b** builds the
resolver that reads it and **X-au-e** cuts generated rows over onto it.

class TemplateAmountVersion(TimestampMixin, db.Model):
    """One effective-dated version of a recurring definition's stated amount.

    A child of EXACTLY ONE of :class:`~app.models.transaction_template.TransactionTemplate`
    or :class:`~app.models.transfer_template.TransferTemplate`, through an
    exclusive arc of two nullable typed foreign keys with a CHECK that exactly
    one is set (developer, 2026-08-11).  One table rather than two: the two
    template kinds are parallel by construction, so a version table per kind
    would duplicate the model, the resolver, the write door and their tests --
    the duplication this codebase already carries several one-sided
    ``duplicate-code`` disables for.  The arc is EXACTLY-one rather than
    at-most-one (which is what ruling R-DY chose for ``journal_entries``): a
    version with no owner is not a state this table has, because an amount
    nobody stated for anything is not an amount.

    ``uq_template_amount_versions_transaction_effective`` and its transfer twin
    are PARTIAL unique indexes -- at most one version per template per date, so
    a same-day correction edits that row rather than appending a second -- and
    each doubles as the index for the as-of lookup
    (``WHERE <fk> = ? AND effective_date <= ? ORDER BY effective_date DESC``).
    Partial rather than plain: half this table's rows carry ``NULL`` in either
    key, and an index over those NULLs answers no query.

    The two amount CHECKs mirror the owning tables' own rules rather than
    restating a looser one: ``ck_transaction_templates_nonneg_amount`` allows
    zero, ``ck_transfer_templates_positive_amount`` does not, so a transfer
    version is pinned strictly positive and a transaction version merely
    non-negative.  Stating it here as well as there is what stops a version
    from carrying a figure its own template could not.

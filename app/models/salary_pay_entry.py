    """One entry of a salary profile's pay list: from *payday* on, *amount* a paycheck.

    **The salary's one stored fact** (plan step salary:X-av-3a, rulings
    **R-SAL59** and **R-SAL61**; findings **N-237** and **N-391**).  It
    replaced ``salary_profiles.annual_salary``, one undated yearly figure the
    engine divided by the paychecks a year: a typed-in raise re-priced every
    paycheck not yet received, back to January, and a typo fix looked exactly
    like a raise.  An entry is dated, so a raise received is a NEW entry and a
    correction is a Fix of the entry it corrects, which moves only the
    paychecks that entry covers.  The yearly figure is the amount times the
    paychecks a year of the rhythm in force on the payday, shown and never
    stored (**R-SAL59**, **R-SAL66**).

    What a payday is priced at is
    :meth:`~app.services.payroll_basis.PayrollBasis.base_pay_on`'s answer, and
    this row is read nowhere else by the engine: the latest entry on or before
    the payday (else the first), then every forecast raise landing after that
    entry's payday (:func:`~app.services.salary_raises.applications_between`,
    each step rounded by :func:`~app.services.salary_raises.raise_pay`).

    A profile holds at least one entry, and every door keeps it so: the
    create form writes the first, and no door removes the last (**R-SAL68**;
    the Remove door is plan step salary:X-av-3b's).

    Optimistic locking: see :class:`Transaction` for the ``version_id_col``
    contract.  Two tabs fixing one entry race for the bump; the loser raises
    ``StaleDataError`` and the route surfaces a flash + redirect.

    Attributes:
        payday: The payday the entry takes effect on -- a payday on the
            owner's calendar, saved or projected, which the doors check.
        amount: The gross base pay of one paycheck from that payday on,
            before any forecast raise landing after it.

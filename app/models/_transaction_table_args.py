"""
Shekel Budget App -- ``budget.transactions``' table arguments, as one value.

**Born as a PURE MOVE** (plan step X-ca, developer 2026-09-06, under ruling
**balance:R-IR**: *pylint's 1,000-line module ceiling stays, and the session
that breaks a module is the one that splits it*).
:class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` stood at 997 of that ceiling, so
the next constraint the balance arc adds could not be written at all -- and
R-IR's answer is to SPLIT, never to shave a comment or raise the limit, the
module-level ``too-many-lines`` escape hatch having been withdrawn with it.  The
340 lines of ``__table_args__`` came here verbatim: nothing reworded, reordered
or dropped.  **The constraint that split was made for is the first member
added since**: ``ck_transactions_template_row_needs_due_date`` (plan step
X-bv-2, 2026-09-11), so the purity claim below is dated to the move and
describes the 25 members that came across, not the tuple as it stands.

**Why THIS seam.**  ``__table_args__`` is the one part of the model that is a
VALUE rather than a declaration.  It names no attribute the class exposes, no
caller imports it, and SQLAlchemy reads it exactly once at class construction --
so moving it changes what a reader scrolls past, and nothing else.  Every other
candidate cut (the columns, the hybrid properties, the class docstring) would
have separated things a reader needs side by side.

**What establishes "pure", and what does NOT.**  The claim is settled by an AST
comparison: ``ast.dump`` of the tuple here equals ``ast.dump`` of the expression
this replaced, so the 25 members are identical in KIND, in ORDER and in every
keyword argument -- which rules out a drop, a swap, a reworded predicate and a
changed ``ondelete`` at once.  A byte-exact reverse-dedent of the 340 lines
agrees, and so does a compiled-DDL diff of the ``CREATE TABLE`` plus all 11
``CREATE INDEX`` statements.

*Counting the constructed table is NOT sufficient, and an adversarial review
proved it by mutation rather than by argument.*  A census of
``Transaction.__table__``'s columns, constraint names, predicates and column
lists -- 29 / 27 / 11, identical here -- is BLIND to ``postgresql_using``,
``postgresql_ops``, ``deferrable``, ``initially``, ``info`` and a column
``comment``: an index silently switched to a hash method reads identical through
it.  The count is worth stating and is not the evidence.

The argument for each index and constraint stays WITH it, in the comments below.
They are why this file is long and they are worth the length: several of them
record what a missing predicate cost in dollars on real data.

    # figure, so the two states pair exactly one-to-one with the presence of
    # a figure -- which makes a stale derived amount UNREPRESENTABLE rather

    #
    # **WHAT THIS CONSTRAINT NOW CATCHES, restated at plan step X-au-k
    # because the paragraph here described a world that has ended.**  It
    # used to say that every private repair mechanism R-FI names writes the
    # amount column ALONE, so a writer stamping a figure onto a derived row
    # was an ``IntegrityError`` at flush.  Two of those mechanisms were
    # converted at X-au-k and ``transfer_service``'s copy and drift
    # corrector were deleted at X-au-g-2c-2, so no writer in this
    # application writes one column any more: the pair is ONE mapped
    # attribute over a type that has no member for the illegal shape, and
    # the ORM spelling raises ``AttributeError`` before a flush is reached.
    #
    # This CHECK is therefore the backstop rather than the catcher, and it
    # is not redundant.  It refuses the EMPTY pair, which the type does not
    # represent and a half-built row passes through legitimately in memory;
    # and it refuses a writer that is not this application at all -- a
    # migration, a ``psql`` session, a trigger, a bulk ``UPDATE`` that
    # names the column rather than the attribute.  A reader that skips the

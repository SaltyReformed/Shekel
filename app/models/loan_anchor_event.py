"""
Shekel Budget App -- Loan Anchor Event Model (budget schema)

Append-only log of dated balance assertions for a loan account.  The
loan resolver (Commit 13 / E-18) replays confirmed payments forward
from the latest event in this log to derive the loan's current
principal, monthly payment, and full amortisation schedule on read.

Two row provenances are recorded via the ``source_id`` FK into
``ref.loan_anchor_sources``:

* ``origination`` -- LEGACY ONLY (the read switch's final commit retired
  this write): rows materialised from the immutable :class:`LoanParams`
  fields (``origination_date``, ``original_principal``) by the Commit 12
  backfill migration and, until the retirement, by ``create_params``.
  Every consumer now SYNTHESIZES the origination anchor from the params
  (``loan_loaders.load_loan_anchor_facts``) and ignores these rows --
  they are value-identical append-only history, kept, never read.
* ``user_trueup`` -- appended by the loan dashboard's balance-edit
  flow (Commit 16, decision D-C) whenever the operator asserts a new
  dated balance: the operator's SOURCE DOCUMENT, from which the genesis
  ledger's self-healing TRUEUP correction is derived and re-derived.
  Mirrors the checking-account ``AccountAnchorHistory``
  UX so the mental model is consistent across account types.

This table is **structurally append-only**.  Application code never
updates or deletes a row, mirroring the
:class:`AccountAnchorHistory` design and matching the project's
forensic-immutability stance for financial state changes.  The
in-process guard fires on any ORM-mediated UPDATE or DELETE
(:func:`sqlalchemy.event` listeners below); database-level CASCADE
deletes from ``budget.accounts`` still cascade through the FK action,
since those run outside the ORM and are the documented disposal path
for an entire account's history.

Duplicate-submit prevention follows the :class:`AccountAnchorHistory`
precedent, and since ruling **R-EQ** (plan step X-f1c4b) that precedent is a
WRITE-DOOR rule rather than a unique index: an event is appended only when it
differs from the event that already governs its source.  See
:func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service._append_loan_anchor_and_sync` for the rule
and the ``__table_args__`` comment below for what the deleted index could not
express.

    """Append-only dated balance assertion for a loan account.

    Read by the loan resolver (Commit 13) which selects the most
    recent event per account, treats ``(anchor_date, anchor_balance)``
    as the snap-to point, and replays confirmed shadow-income
    transactions forward from that anchor to produce a current
    balance, monthly payment, and full amortisation schedule.

    The ``source_id`` FK is RESTRICT-on-delete because the seed rows
    in ``ref.loan_anchor_sources`` are non-removable application
    invariants: a successful DELETE would orphan every event tagged
    with that source.

    Storage tier guarantees:

    * ``anchor_balance >= 0`` -- a negative loan balance is
      meaningless; the engine treats overpayment as zero principal,
      and a positive-only domain matches every monetary CHECK in
      the rest of the schema.
    * ``account_id`` CASCADE-on-delete -- deleting a loan account
      removes its anchor history with it.  No orphan-event rows.
    * No uniqueness guard over the row's VALUES, deliberately (ruling R-EQ)
      -- a duplicate submit is refused at the write door, which can compare
      against what governs; an index over the row's values cannot.  See the
      ``__table_args__`` comment below, which also says why the one UNIQUE
      the table does carry, over ``(account_id, id)``, rejects no row.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Statement Import Models (budget schema)

What a BANK said, recorded as fact.  Four tables, one subject (plan step
``bank_import:X-f6a``, ruling **R-FP**; the fourth at ``bank_import:X-f6b-1``,
ruling **R-BI10**):

  * :class:`AccountExternalIdentity` -- which account at a SOURCE is which
    account here.  The one-time mapping R-FP calls "a fact, not a guess".
  * :class:`StatementImport` -- one act of importing, and the window it
    declares it answers for.
  * :class:`BankStatementLine` -- one line the bank showed: the fact every
    source agrees on.
  * :class:`StatementLineSighting` -- what ONE import said about ONE line.
    A line is held by the sightings of the imports that showed it, and lives
    while any sighting does.

**None of them moves a figure, and that is the leaf boundary rather than a
coincidence.**  Recording what a statement said is separable from deciding
which of the app's own rows it explains, so this leaf lands with no matcher, no
``settled_on`` correction and no clearing link -- the same discipline that made
``X-au-c1`` and ``X-f3a-1`` provably balance-neutral.  What the recorded lines
are FOR is the leaves after it: the match and its review (``X-f6a-2``), the
purchase a bank line becomes (``X-f6a-3b``), the walked-statement silence that
makes an unshown line NOT CLEARED (``balance:X-f3a-2``), and the re-openable
recorded difference at the cutover (``balance:X-f3c``).

Sign convention, stated once: :attr:`BankStatementLine.amount` is SIGNED and
positive means money ENTERING the account, matching
``cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg`` exactly so a later match compares two figures
that already agree about direction.  Both of the developer's sources use that
convention natively (OFX ``TRNAMT``, and the CSV's Credit / Debit pair), so no
adapter has to invert anything.

    """Which account at a SOURCE is this Shekel account.

    Ruling **R-FP**: the importer "needs a one-time account mapping -- the
    export's ``ACCTID`` to the Shekel account -- and that mapping is a fact, not
    a guess."  This is where the fact lives.

    **It is RECORDED by the user's own choice and then CHECKED, never
    inferred.**  On the first import the user says which account a file is for
    and the file's own identity is written here; on every import after it, the
    file's identity is compared against the recorded one and a disagreement
    REFUSES the import.  Inferring the account from the file instead would make
    a mis-typed export silently post one account's statement onto another --
    and the two sources cannot even be compared for equality, because SECU's
    CSV masks the account number (``******3820``) where its OFX spells it out
    (``40943820``).

    **A row has one of two PROVENANCES, and its lifetime follows** (plan step
    ``bank_import:X-f6b-2``, ruling **R-BI26**).  A row LEARNED from a file is
    the shape above: the first import teaches it, and it is forgotten with the
    last import from that source (ruling **R-GB**), because a fact learned
    from evidence should not outlive the evidence.  A row DECLARED on the bank
    feed panel is the owner saying "Bridge's account X is my Checking" before
    any import exists; its evidence is the owner's standing permission -- the
    ``budget.bank_feeds`` row ``feed_id`` names -- so it dies with THAT, by the
    CASCADE on ``fk_account_external_identities_feed_owner``, and deleting
    imports never touches it.  R-GB's forgetting reads ``feed_id`` to tell the
    two apart, and R-BI26 amends R-GB to exactly that scope: the state R-GB
    rejected, a pairing with no import behind it, is the declared row's
    ordinary state between the claim and the first sync.

                       the account's by ``fk_account_external_identities_owner``
                       so it is a co-located key rather than a copy.  It exists
                       because UNIQUENESS IS PER OWNER: see below.

                       (``ref.statement_sources``).

        feed_id     -- the owner's ``budget.bank_feeds`` row when this row was
                       DECLARED on the feed panel; NULL when it was LEARNED
                       from a file.  Held equal to the row's owner by the
                       composite ``fk_account_external_identities_feed_owner``,
                       ON DELETE CASCADE.  Nothing here says WHICH sources may
                       carry a feed: at this commit no door sets it (the
                       mapping form is the next commit of leaf 3c, and it
                       writes it under the ``simplefin`` source), and

                       pins that a learned row is forgotten and a declared one
                       is not.

    **The key is per SOURCE, not per institution, and that is deliberate
    honesty rather than a limitation accepted.**  SECU's CSV and its OFX are
    two adapters over one real account, and they would produce two rows here.
    Keying on the institution instead would require deciding that
    ``******3820`` and ``40943820`` name the same account -- which is a guess,
    which is exactly what this table exists not to make.  Two rows pointing at
    one ``account_id`` is the truthful record: each says what its own source

                        states no range; a feed sync declares the window it
                        requested, so a quiet day inside it is covered and a
                        zero-line sync still covers what it asked for.  This

                        bounds a placed level (``budget.level_lies_within_file``).
                        *They were ``period_start`` / ``period_end`` -- the

                        import recorded before it the extremes ARE what a CSV
                        declares, so the rename moved no value.*
        stated_balance / stated_balance_on -- what the file's OWN header claims
                        the account held, and the day it names.  A CLAIM, kept
                        verbatim and never rewritten.  Both-or-neither,
                        enforced by
                        ``ck_statement_imports_stated_balance_paired``.

    **``line_count`` and ``recorded_count`` were DELETED at X-f6b-1** (ruling
    **R-IY**: a derivable column is deleted, not maintained).  How many lines
    a file held is how many sightings this import wrote; how many were new is
    how many of those lines it was the FIRST to sight
    (:meth:`StatementLineSighting.first_import_of_each_line`); and the
    receipt still says both, computed by the door that knows them.  A stored
    count beside the rows it counts was a cache with no reconciler, and
    ``ck_statement_imports_line_count_positive`` went with it because a
    zero-line sync that states a balance is an observation, not a parse that
    found nothing.

    **The stated day is NOT the day the figure is for, and that is measured
    rather than defensive.**  SECU writes the balance as of the EXPORT INSTANT
    and labels it with the export's own day.  On the developer's 2026-08-21
    export the header reads ``Balance as of 08/21/2026,2501.310000`` while the
    file's last line is 08-18 and ``2501.31`` is 08-18's closing; on the
    2026-08-16 export it reads ``$4,747.63``, which is 2026-08-13's closing,
    over a file listing two 2026-08-14 lines worth ``-$1,006.72``.  The claim
    and the day it is FOR are therefore two facts, so the file's own words stay
    here and the solved day is a LEVEL.

    **What the import made of the claim is a row in the LEVEL RELATION, not
    two columns here** (plan step ``balance:X-bj-1``, rulings **R-IS** and
    **R-JN**).  ``balance_effective_on`` and ``balance_evidence_id`` lived on
    this row from ``bank_import:X-f6e-1`` until that step, and a release
    nulled them by UPDATE.  The bank's placement is an observation of the same
    quantity the owner's true-ups observe -- the account's balance at the
    close of a day -- so it is a :class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory`
    row naming this import, its amount locked to :attr:`stated_balance` by
    ``fk_anchor_history_statement_import_claim`` over
    ``uq_statement_imports_id_stated_balance``, and its withdrawal an
    appended :class:`~app.models.anchor_release.AnchorRelease`.  An import
    whose header cannot be placed owns no level; one whose placement was
    released owns a level and a release.  The three CHECKs that paired and
    bounded the two columns went with them: the pairing is the level row's
    NOT NULL shape and its keys, and the bound (the solved day lies inside the
    declared window) is ``budget.level_lies_within_file``
    (:mod:`app.level_infrastructure`), attached to BOTH tables so neither the
    level nor this row's window can move outside the other.

    **``opening_balance`` and ``closing_balance`` were DROPPED at X-f6e-1**,
    and dropping them is the point rather than a tidy-up: ``closing`` is
    ``opening + Sigma(lines)`` and ``opening`` is
    ``stated - Sigma(lines up to the effective day)``, so both were derived
    values stored beside their own source with nothing reconciling the three --
    the root cause several of this project's arcs exist to remove.  What is
    stored is the claim; the observation and how firmly it is held are the
    level row's; every balance derives.

    is stored ONCE, on the sighting** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-1b``,
    ruling **R-BI16**, which amends R-BI10's "stays on the line" clause).

    (:attr:`StatementLineSighting.merchant_id`, by
    :meth:`StatementImport.act_order`), so the merchant a
    :class:`~app.models.merchant_rule.MerchantRule` is stated against does not
    move when a later source shows a different word, and a deleted import
    takes its own word with it and leaves nothing to repair.  *The key lived
    HERE from plan step ``bank_import:X-gd-1`` (when the merchant became a
    row) until X-f6b-1b: minted from the first sighting that named a word,
    filled from a later one only while NULL -- a derived value stored beside
    its source with no reconciler, so a line kept a key that a since-deleted
    import had minted (finding **BI-504**).*

    **Both reads are ONE SQL producer each, and nothing else derives them**
    (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14; R-BI16's "one SQL producer, read-only" option):
    a ``column_property`` built by :func:`_stated_by_the_naming_sighting`,
    correlated to this row explicitly, so ``line.merchant_id`` on a loaded
    row and ``BankStatementLine.merchant_id`` in a ``filter``, ``group_by``
    or ``distinct`` are the same subquery -- a reader in either dialect
    reaches the one walk, and there is no Python re-derivation to agree
    with it.  The ``hybrid_property`` over each is the SEAL: a
    ``column_property`` accepts an assignment silently (measured 2026-09-18
    on SQLAlchemy 2.0: the constructor kwarg and ``row.attr = x`` both land
    in the instance and vanish at the next load), where the hybrid without a
    setter raises ``AttributeError`` on both, so no writer can put a key on
    a line.  **A loaded row's answer is as of its load**: the record door
    expires :data:`READS_OVER_SIGHTINGS` on every held line after it stages
    this import's sightings, and a locked read reloads them
    (``statement_match._resolve.locked_for_write`` composes
    ``populate_existing()``), which is the same rule the eager
    :attr:`sightings` collection already lived under.

    **The facts a SOURCE states about a line are its sighting's**, read
    through :attr:`sightings` and exposed here once each so a reader holding a
    line does not have to know which sighting to ask: :attr:`description`,
    :attr:`source_category` and :attr:`running_balance` are the sighting of
    the LATEST import (:attr:`current`) -- what the bank calls the line now --
    and :attr:`transaction_on` is the EARLIEST day any sighting states,
    because that is the day a match writes onto a purchase's ``purchased_on``
    (ruling **R-FW**) and money cannot be spent after the earliest day a
    source says it was.  A source's own id (``external_id``) is exposed on no
    line property: it is corroboration this source's next import pairs on
    (``_record``), never a fact about the line.

    **A line's stored IDENTITY is ``(account_id, posted_on, amount,
    sequence_in_group)``**, and the ordinal is what makes that key total.  Two
    genuinely distinct charges can share a day and an amount -- the same coffee
    twice -- and a key without the ordinal would reject the second as a
    duplicate, which is silent money loss on exactly the shape a duplicate
    detector is supposed to protect.

    **The ordinal is a SURROGATE this app mints, and no re-import compares
    against it** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-4``).  Three of the key's four
    terms are facts the bank stated; this one is not, and the write door used
    to compare an incoming line against whatever sat at its ordinal -- treating
    an app-assigned number as though the bank had supplied it, which is a
    derived value stored beside its source with nothing reconciling the two.
    Measured against the shipped code 2026-08-20, that refused a whole file on
    two events that were not restatements at all: two same-day same-amount
    lines re-ordered between exports, and a genuinely NEW line the bank
    INSERTED ahead of a recorded one.  A re-import now reconciles a
    ``(posted_on, amount)`` GROUP as a set -- by this source's own id, then by
    the wording this source wrote, then by count against the lines another
    source showed (``statement_import._reconcile._reconcile``) -- and mints an
    ordinal only for a line it has decided is new
    (:func:`app.services.statement_import.fresh_ordinals`).  What this key
    still guarantees is that every recorded line has a distinct, stable
    address, which is the whole of what a surrogate owes.

    **The merchant is a FACT the adapter states, not a token a reader parses,
    and the NULL is the source saying it names none** (plan step
    ``bank_import:X-f6a-3d``).  It was
    ``statement_match._offers.merchant_of(description)``, read at render time,
    and that was right for what it fed: a form's name box, where a wrong parse
    costs a badly-named row.  Keying a RULE on it is a stronger claim than a
    display default can carry, in one specific way -- that reader is TOTAL, so
    a source with no merchant token falls back to the whole description, and
    SECU's own OFX truncates 326 of its 361 descriptions to exactly 32
    characters.  Every one of those would key one rule, which would then fire
    on every merchant behind them.  A NULL keys nothing, so a source that
    cannot name a merchant offers no rule rather than a wrong one -- the same
    direction a missing fact has to fail in that :attr:`transaction_on` already
    fails in.
    **It is read from the source's own merchant FIELD** (for SECU's CSV, the
    parenthesised trailing token of the Description CELL) rather than from
    the description, which is the ``Description | Memo`` join -- so a user's
    own memo ending in parentheses cannot become the key a rule matches on.
    That bound is structural rather than guarded, exactly as
    ``_secu_csv._stated_transaction_day``'s is.

    **There is deliberately no ``transaction_on <= posted_on`` CHECK** on a
    sighting.  The obvious constraint is false on real data: 2 of 361 lines
    in the developer's own SECU export carry an OFX ``DTUSER`` one day AFTER
    their ``DTPOSTED`` (both ACH deposits, 2026-02-24 and 2026-03-18).  A
    constraint that a real statement violates would make the truth
    unimportable.
    **What depends on that day being the earlier one is therefore a READER's
    guard, not the schema's** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3a``): a match
    corrects a purchase's ``purchased_on`` to this day, and
    ``entry_service.update_entry`` refuses the pair a later one would make --
    so the proposer declines the pairing rather than the table refusing the
    line.

    **THE one producer of a line's merchant** (plan step
    ``bank_import:X-f6b-1b``, ruling **R-BI16**): a scalar subquery over the
    line's sightings that name a merchant, joined to their imports for the
    act order and to the merchant row for its name, taking the first by
    :meth:`StatementImport.act_order`.  Both of
    :class:`BankStatementLine`'s projections are built here, so the key and
    the label a reader gets off one row come from the SAME sighting by
    construction rather than by two derivations agreeing.

    **Correlated to the line EXPLICITLY, and that is load-bearing.**  A
    scalar subquery auto-correlates every table the enclosing statement also
    selects from, and one reader encloses this in a statement that joins
    the sightings and the imports itself
    (``statement_match._vocabulary.account_payment_merchants`` files a line
    under a category by ANY of its sightings).  Measured 2026-09-18 on that
    reader, four ways: written with an IMPLICIT ``FROM`` (every table named
    only in the ``WHERE``) and left to auto-correlate, the inner sightings
    ARE the outer joined row and the set holds the filing sighting's
    merchant instead of the line's -- the silent wrong answer; the explicit
    ``select_from(...).join(...)`` chain below happens to survive
    auto-correlation, because a ``JOIN`` is one ``FROM`` element the outer
    statement does not hold; and ``correlate(BankStatementLine)`` is correct
    under BOTH forms, because it names the one table that IS the enclosing
    row and keeps every other in the subquery's own ``FROM``, where it
    shadows the outer one.  So the correlate is the guarantee and the join
    chain is the shape; a rewrite that drops both is what
    ``test_the_set_holds_the_LINES_merchant_not_the_filing_sightings``
    (``tests/test_services/test_statement_match/test_bars.py``) fails on.

Shekel Budget App -- Shared Model Mixins

Centralizes column declarations that would otherwise repeat verbatim
across many model files.  SQLAlchemy mixins produce DDL identical to
inline column declarations; the only effect is to keep the canonical
definition in one place so a future change (e.g. timezone choice,
default precision) is a single edit instead of N edits.

Mixins are NOT registered in ``app/models/__init__.py`` -- they
represent shared declarations, not concrete tables.

class UserScopedMixin:
    """Owning-user foreign key for per-user data tables.

    Adds one column:

      ``user_id`` -- INTEGER NOT NULL, ``FK auth.users.id ON DELETE
                     CASCADE``.  Identifies the user who owns the row;
                     deleting a user cascades to every row they own.

    Applied to the user-owned tables whose ``user_id`` is exactly this
    shape: a NOT NULL CASCADE FK with no ``unique`` qualifier.  Three
    ``user_id`` columns are deliberately EXCLUDED because their DDL
    differs:

      * ``ref.*`` per-user override rows (``AccountType``) -- the FK is
        ``ON DELETE RESTRICT`` and ``nullable=True`` (a NULL ``user_id``
        marks a seeded, system-owned row).
      * ``auth.user_settings`` / ``auth.mfa_configs`` -- 1:1 satellite
        tables whose ``user_id`` carries ``unique=True``.

    ``Transaction`` has NO ``user_id`` at all -- it is scoped through
    ``pay_period_id`` / ``account_id`` -- so it does not use this mixin.

    DDL-ORDERING NOTE (differs from the end-positioned mixins below).
    SQLAlchemy renders mixin columns AFTER a class's own columns, so
    extracting this previously-second column moves ``user_id`` to the
    tail of the emitted ``CREATE TABLE``.  This is NOT byte-identical to
    the prior inline declaration -- unlike :class:`OptimisticLockMixin`
    et al., whose columns already sat at the table tail.  It is
    nonetheless safe here, and the correct verification standard for
    this mixin is **order-independent equivalence + an empty Alembic
    autogenerate diff**, not byte-identical DDL, because column ORDER is
    load-bearing nowhere in this project:

      * the test suite clones the Alembic-migrated ``shekel_test_template``
        (column order comes from the migration chain, not the model);
      * no code or test does positional row/column access on these
        tables (the ORM addresses every column by name);
      * the documented ``db.create_all()`` <-> migration alignment
        invariant is about CONSTRAINT NAMES and existence, never order.

    Alembic autogenerate compares columns by name, so the reorder
    produces no migration.  If the auth-FK policy ever changes (e.g. a
    different ``ondelete``, or an added FK index), it is now a single
    edit here instead of ~15.

        CLASS, not an instance, and SQLAlchemy's own documented signature for
        the decorator names that parameter ``cls``.  The same disable
        :meth:`OptimisticLockMixin.__mapper_args__` carries for the same reason.

        Args:
            cls: The mapped class, supplied by ``declared_attr``.  Its
                ``__tablename__`` is what makes the constraint name per-table.

        The type guard lives on the COLUMN rather than only at the write door,
        and that placement is the point (finding **N-179**).  The seam refuses
        an instant it is handed, but nothing stopped a caller -- or a fixture --
        assigning the attribute directly, and PostgreSQL then truncates the
        instant on the UTC session clock in silence.  A validator fires for the
        constructor, for a plain ``txn.settled_on = ...``, and for every ORM
        write path, so the wrong type is a loud ``TypeError`` wherever it is
        written instead of a day that is wrong by one.

        It is not a fence with an allowlist and it hunts no call sites: the
        column simply does not accept the type.  The residual, stated because
        an unstated limit reads as stronger than it is: a bulk
        ``query.update({"settled_on": ...})`` bypasses the ORM attribute layer
        and is not seen here, the same boundary
        ``LoanAnchorEvent``'s append-only guard states for itself.

        Args:
            value: The candidate settle day.  (SQLAlchemy also passes the
            attribute name, always ``settled_on``, which this ignores.)

        Returns:
            *value* unchanged when it is a civil ``date`` or ``None``.

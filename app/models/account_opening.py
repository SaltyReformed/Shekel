"""Shekel Budget App -- Account Opening Equity Model (budget schema).

**What an account held before its records begin, as a RECORDED FACT** (plan
step X-f3c-2a, ruling **R-GX**).  One append-only row per restatement; the
latest recorded row governs.

**The quantity, in one sentence.**  An account's opening equity is the capital
its books opened with -- the level every balance the app has ever rendered is
stacked on top of.  On the developer's own Checking account it is ``$689.16``:
the ``$2,746.58`` asserted for 2026-03-27 less the ``$2,057.42`` of movements
that assertion already contained.

**It was INFERRED on every read until this step, and each of the four defects
that caused has the same root.**  The balance fold re-derived it as
"the earliest assertion minus the movements dated at or before it"
(``balance_at._cash_fold._actual_steps``' seed, ruling **R-I**), which meant:

1. **It moved when an assertion was BACK-DATED.**  Which assertion was "the
   opening" was decided by SORT POSITION -- ``is_opening = index == 0`` over
   ``(observed_on, created_at, id)`` in ``cash_ledger._events`` -- and
   ``anchor_service.resolve_observation_day`` permits a back-dated assertion.
   Recording a balance for a day earlier than any on file silently re-elected
   the opening, recomputed the constant, and moved every pre-opening balance,
   with no surface saying so.
2. **It differed per SCENARIO.**  The subtraction ran over
   ``settled_cash_facts(account_id, scenario_id)``, so two scenarios holding
   different settled rows produced two opening equities for one real bank
   account.  Money that existed before tracking began cannot be a function of
   a what-if.
3. **It could not be CORRECTED.**  Finding **N-275**: account 1's opening
   asserts ``$2,746.58`` for 2026-03-27 where the bank's own closing that day
   is ``$3,182.63``, so the inferred figure is wrong by ``$436.05`` and there
   was nowhere to say so.
4. **It was derived TWICE.**  The read fold seeded it; the posted ledger
   booked it again as the ``account_opening`` journal entry's linked leg
   (``asserted - ledger_before``).  Measured on a production clone 2026-08-27
   the two agree to the cent on all seven non-loan accounts -- because both ran
   the same subtraction, not because either read a fact.

This table is the fact both now read.

**Why a satellite table rather than a column or a journal entry** (developer,
2026-08-27).  A column on ``budget.accounts`` would have to be NULLABLE for an
amortizing loan, a rule the schema cannot state because the kind lives on
``ref.account_types``, and it would sit exactly where ruling **R-EH** deleted
``accounts.current_anchor_balance``.  The posted ``account_opening`` journal
entry cannot be the source of truth for three separate reasons: it is
scenario-scoped (defect 2 returns), a ``$0.00`` opening books no entry at all
so "zero" is indistinguishable from "none", and the posted ledger is a
PROJECTION of the walk in this codebase, so reading it from the balance seam
would invert the arc's own dependency direction.  What is left is a per-account,
scenario-free, always-present record -- the shape ``loan_params`` /
``interest_params`` / ``investment_params`` already use.

**EVERY account carries one, including an amortizing loan, and that is a
REACHABILITY fact rather than a tidiness preference.**  The spec's first draft
said the two loans get no row.  They must: ``balance_at.balance_at`` -- the
KIND-CORRECT public entry the savings page and the net-worth surfaces read --
dispatches on ``_resolution.configured_loan``, which returns ``None`` for an
amortizing account carrying no :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`, and
falls through to the replay over this fold.  That state is ordinary (create a
Mortgage, do not finish the loan-params form), so a loan without a row would
raise on a live screen.  With every account carrying one, absence is
unreachable and :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.account_opening_fact` refuses it
rather than falling back to a fabricated ``$0.00``.  A CONFIGURED loan never
reads its row: its opening is ``LoanParams.original_principal``, materialised
by ``loan_loaders.synthesize_origination_anchor``.

**It carries the DAY as well as the amount, and fixing only the amount would
have left half of defect 1 alive.**  ``opened_on`` is the civil day the books
opened.  The posted ``account_opening`` journal entry is dated on it; before
this step that entry was dated on whichever assertion sorted first, so
back-dating still silently re-dated the opening posting and demoted the
previous one to a true-up.  With the day stored, ``is_opening`` stops existing
as a money concept: this row books the ``account_opening`` kind and every
assertion books ``account_trueup``, with no positional flag left to read.

**THE EQUITY IS THE BALANCE AT THE CLOSE OF ``opened_on``, so no cash movement
may be dated ON OR BEFORE that day** (plan step X-f3c-2b, ruling **R-HG**).
That is the same rule ``account_anchor_history.observed_on`` states for an
assertion (ruling R-DH (a)) -- "a source dated at or before this day is already
inside this figure" -- and adopting it is what makes the table's two writers
mean one thing.  ``account_service.create_account`` stores the balance a human
typed "as of" a day, which is that day's close; migration ``a7c41f9d2b60``
derived a level from BEFORE the earliest recorded movement while dating it at
the earliest ASSERTION.  One column, two semantics, differing by whatever moved
that day -- and where the movement is not absorbed, counted twice (finding
**N-378**: the fold seeds here and ``dated_deltas`` emits the row at its own
day, so the running total carries it again until an assertion resets it, and on
a MODELLED account that reset books to ``unrealized_change``, turning a transfer
into market performance that never unwinds).

**The rule is enforced where it cannot be skipped, not where it is convenient.**
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.reject_movement_before_books_open` refuses it at
:func:`app.services.settle_day.record_settle_day` -- the ONE assignment of
``settled_on`` on either movement table -- and at
``reconcile_service.record_settled_days``, the bulk ``UPDATE`` that has no ORM
instance to hand that function.  What makes the state UNSTORABLE rather than
merely refused is :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure`: deferrable constraint
triggers over ``budget.transactions``, ``budget.transaction_entries`` and this
table, so the rule holds in BOTH directions -- an opening cannot be restated
FORWARD past a movement either -- and against a writer nobody enumerated.

**Append-only, latest governs -- the same shape as its two siblings.**
:class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory` records what a bank said and
:class:`~app.models.loan_anchor_event.LoanAnchorEvent` records what a loan owed;
both are append-only and this is the third member of that family.  An UPDATE
would make a restatement invisible to the app -- ``system.audit_log`` would hold
it, but nothing could render it, which is the exact gap finding **N-205** built
the balance-history card to close.  Restating the number every balance rests on
is not a state this app may enter silently.

**"Latest governs" is NOT the positional read this step deletes**, and the
difference is which clock orders it.  ``is_opening`` inferred a TYPE from
position in a list ordered by ``observed_on`` -- a business date the owner may
back-date -- so an ordinary user action changed the inference.  This orders by
``created_at``, the recording instant, which no door lets a user move; it is
the same rule ``cash_ledger.governing_anchor_on`` already applies to
assertions, and it is monotone by construction.

Reads: :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.account_opening_fact`.  Writes:
``account_service.create_account`` (``user_declared``) and migration
``a7c41f9d2b60`` (``migration_derived``).

      * ``failed_login_count`` -- count of consecutive bad-password
        attempts.  Incremented inside ``auth_service.authenticate`` on
        every failed verify, reset to ``0`` on a successful login or
        when the threshold trips and ``locked_until`` is stamped.

        ``NULL`` outside lockout.  ``authenticate`` short-circuits and
        raises ``AuthError`` without running ``verify_password`` while
        ``locked_until > now`` so a brute-force attacker observes
        constant-time rejections during the lockout window (no timing
        oracle on whether the password was correct on the locked
        account).

    Together these columns implement per-account brute-force throttling
    that does not depend on Flask-Limiter's IP-keyed storage.  IP
    rotation (residential proxy, RFC 1918 spoofing) cannot bypass the
    per-account counter -- only knowing the password before the
    lockout trips can.  Threshold and duration are env-configurable
    via ``LOCKOUT_THRESHOLD`` and ``LOCKOUT_DURATION_MINUTES``; see

    The TOTP secret is encrypted at rest using Fernet symmetric

    During an in-progress /mfa/setup flow the unconfirmed secret is

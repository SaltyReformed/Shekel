"""
Shekel Budget App -- Loan payment settings model (budget schema)

The loan-payment attributes of a recurring transfer, normalized off the generic
:class:`~app.models.transfer_template.TransferTemplate` into their own 1:1 table
(decision B, ``docs/design/escrow_line_identity_refactor.md`` Sec. 6.3).

A recurring transfer that is a LOAN payment carries two settings the generic
transfer does not: whether its cash amount is derived LIVE from the destination
loan (``derive_from_loan``, moved here off ``transfer_templates`` to retire that
column's loan-only smell) and a standing extra-principal amount added on top of
the base payment every month (``extra_principal``, the overpayment feature).  A
template with no ``loan_payment_settings`` row is not a loan payment: every
reader defaults ``derive_from_loan`` to ``False`` and ``extra_principal`` to
``0.00`` for the row-absent case, so investment contributions and generic
transfers are unaffected.

``extra_principal`` is applied as a LIVE loan-level parameter -- added to the
cash at display, frozen at settlement, and threaded into the payoff projection
-- rather than baked into the stored transfer amount, so changing it updates
every surface from one source with no shadow regeneration.  See the design doc
Sec. 6 for the full overpayment model.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Journal Entry + Posting Models (budget schema)

The append-only double-entry ledger for the posting architecture
(Build-Order Step 2).  A confirmed financial event is recorded as one
:class:`JournalEntry` header plus two or more :class:`Posting` legs whose
signed amounts sum to zero.  Step 2 pilots the mechanism on settled
transfers (the simplest balanced event: money leaves one account and
enters another), so the only legs written are a transfer's two.

**Coexistence, not replacement.**  These tables run *alongside*
``budget.transfers`` / ``budget.transactions``.  Every balance read in the
app still flows through the ``balance_at`` seam over ``budget.transactions``
(Build-Order Step 1); nothing reads postings yet.  The ledger is a parallel,
independently-checkable record of the confirmed-transfer subset, validated
by the reconciliation oracle (Commit 6) against the settled-transfer shadow
effect in ``budget.transactions``.

**The signed amount is debit-positive.**  Each :class:`Posting` carries one
signed ``Numeric(12,2)`` ``amount``: a debit is positive, a credit is
negative.  For a transfer the *from* leg is ``-amount`` (a credit: money
leaving) and the *to* leg is ``+amount`` (a debit: money entering), so the
entry sums to zero regardless of whether a leg's ledger account is an asset
or a liability.  The posting builder therefore never branches on account
class; the class only affects how a *reader* later interprets an account's
accumulated debit-positive balance (Asset/Expense are debit-normal;
Liability/Income/Equity are credit-normal -- see
:class:`app.models.ref.LedgerAccountClass`).  Debit-positive (not
"balance-effect") is required so the sum-to-zero self-check survives the
later steps that post income and expense legs.

**Append-only, corrected by reversing entries.**  Mirroring
:class:`app.models.loan_anchor_event.LoanAnchorEvent`, both tables are
structurally append-only: the ``before_update`` / ``before_delete``
SQLAlchemy listeners below raise :class:`JournalEntryImmutableError` /
:class:`PostingImmutableError` on any ORM-mediated UPDATE or DELETE.  A
correction is a NEW balanced (reversing) entry, never an edit.  The
database-level CASCADE that disposes of an entire tenancy
(``journal_entries.user_id`` / ``scenario_id`` / ``pay_period_id`` are
CASCADE, and ``account_postings.journal_entry_id`` / ``ledger_account_id``
are CASCADE) runs OUTSIDE the ORM session, so the listeners do not block it;
the audit-log trigger captures the disposed rows regardless.  The
``passive_deletes=True`` on the postings relationship tells SQLAlchemy to
rely on that database CASCADE rather than loading and individually deleting
the legs (which would trip the leg's own ``before_delete`` guard).

**The balanced-journal invariant is enforced in the database.**  Per-entry
``SUM(amount) = 0`` and ``COUNT(*) >= 2`` cannot be expressed as a row-level
CHECK, so they live in a *deferred* constraint trigger
(``ck_account_postings_balanced``) that validates at COMMIT, after all of an
entry's legs are inserted.  Its SQL is centralised in
:mod:`app.posting_infrastructure` (modeled on
:mod:`app.audit_infrastructure`) so the migration, ``scripts/init_database``
(the ``create_all`` path that bypasses migrations), and
``scripts/build_test_template`` stay in lock-step.  The trigger fires
``AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE`` but NOT on DELETE, so the CASCADE disposal path
does not abort mid-cascade on a transient ``COUNT < 2``.

class JournalEntry(UserScopedMixin, CreatedAtMixin, db.Model):
    """The header of one balanced double-entry event.

    Carries the owning ``user_id`` (tenancy), the ``scenario_id`` and
    ``pay_period_id`` the event is attributed to (the join keys the
    reconciliation oracle uses), the civil ``entry_date`` of the confirmed
    event, a ``source_kind_id`` naming the *kind* of source
    (``ref.posting_sources`` -- ``transfer`` in Step 2, ``transaction`` in
    Step 3), an optional concrete ``transfer_id`` / ``transaction_id``
    linking back to the source row, and a human ``description``.

    The source references are deliberately layered: ``source_kind_id``
    answers "what kind of event posted this?" (a non-removable ref
    invariant, RESTRICT) while each concrete nullable FK answers "which
    concrete source row?" (SET NULL, so the immutable posted fact survives a
    source delete).  Step 2 added ``transfer_id``; Step 3 adds
    ``transaction_id`` beside it for ordinary (non-transfer) settled
    transactions.  ``source_kind_id`` disambiguates which is set: a
    ``transfer`` entry carries ``transfer_id`` (``transaction_id`` NULL), a
    ``transaction`` entry the reverse.  Later Build-Order steps add one
    concrete nullable FK per new source kind beside these two.  (The
    one-set-FK-per-entry rule is maintained by the posting builder, not a
    storage CHECK -- a CHECK would have to grow with every future source
    kind and reference ref-table IDs it cannot see; the reconciliation
    oracle is the cross-source correctness gate.)

    Append-only: see the module docstring.  Disposal is the database-level
    CASCADE from a deleted user / scenario / pay period, which runs outside
    the ORM and so is not blocked by the immutability listeners below.

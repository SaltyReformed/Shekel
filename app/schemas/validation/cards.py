"""The credit card's forms: its terms (plan step credit_card:CC-2) and its APR (CC-3).

**The terms.**  ONE schema for ONE door: the "Card terms" form on the cash detail page
renders every control every time, so a submit IS the whole row, and the door
creates the row when the card has none and rewrites it when it has one
(developer ruling **R-CC24**, 2026-09-18: one door, one schema).  There is no
create / update pair here on purpose -- the loan has two because its CREATE
also seeds a rate row and posts a genesis ledger, and the interest door's
every-field-optional shape needs a "required when configuring for the first
time" branch that restates the NOT NULL rule the database already holds.  The
five NOT NULL columns are REQUIRED, ``cashback_rate`` among them: the form
renders it pre-filled with ``0.00`` for a card with no terms, so a browser
always posts a value, and a submit that carries none is a crafted or truncated
POST rather than a choice -- refused, never silently written as zero over a
rate the owner stated.  The two nullable columns read an empty control as
NULL, the "not set" state the model documents.

E-28 / HIGH-06 / PA-02: both rates are validated as decimal fractions pinned
to ``[0, 1]``, matching the model's CHECKs, and the ``@pre_load`` converts the
form percent (``"2.5"``) to its fraction (``"0.025"``) so the schema's
``Range`` and the DB CHECK accept exactly the same set of values.

**The APR.**  :class:`CardAprSchema` is the second form, two controls, for the
set-by-date door (developer ruling **R-CC27**).

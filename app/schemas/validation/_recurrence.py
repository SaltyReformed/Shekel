"""The recurrence controls both template forms submit, and the rules on them.

Everything a form states about HOW OFTEN a definition repeats: the two cadence
axis fields, the cross-field rules over them, the closing bound's
three-controls-into-one-value composition, and the
:class:`RecurrenceFormFieldsMixin` the two template create schemas inherit.

Split out of :mod:`._helpers` at plan step R7c-b, when that module met the
1,000-line cap.  The seam is the one the module list already implied: `_helpers`
holds the primitives EVERY domain schema in this package needs -- the base
schema, the shared range validators, the percent-to-fraction hook, the
:class:`~app.schemas.validation._helpers.RowId` field and the
:class:`~app.schemas.validation._helpers._RefEnumField` base -- while this holds
one DOMAIN's shared form.  Nothing outside the two template schemas imports it.

**Two of the rules here are one half of a pair**, and each says so in its own
docstring, because the layer that holds the other half cannot be reached from a
schema: a schema never sees the template being edited, so it cannot know whether
an update AUTHORS a rule (``RECURRENCE_NEEDS_A_START``) or what the STORED half
of a validity window is (:func:`end_bound_before_start_message`).  Both name the
route helper that completes them.

    once.  Completeness is a property of the whole ``(interval, unit,
    placement)`` triple and of no single field, which is why all three are
    asked here.

    **What can still be REFUSED changed at plan step R7c-c.**  While the
    cadence was stored as a closed-set pattern id, the binding constraint was
    STORAGE: the set covered every N pay periods but only 1, 3 or 6 months, and
    paired the first-paycheck placement with a ONE-month interval only.  With
    ``interval_n`` and ``unit_id`` authored columns every reading can be stored,
    so what is left is whether the application can HONOUR the
    ``(unit, placement)`` PAIR.  Until plan step **R8-a** that meant "can a
    first occurrence be DERIVED", which refused two pairs by naming derivations
    ruling **R-R16** had already deleted; it is the two live rules
    :func:`~app.services.recurrence.authorable_cadences` states now, and the
    only reading still refused is the ``WEEK`` unit -- whose occurrences are
    neither paydays nor days of the month, so
    ``recurrence_engine.compute_due_date`` has nothing to date its rows from
    until plan step **R5** gives a generated row its own ``occurs_on``.  **The
    interval is no longer able to make a cadence unauthorable**, which is what
    the refusal's own copy had to stop saying.

    **This is the door's copy of a rule the FORM already makes unreachable.**
    Plan step R7b-2 serves the picker's options from
    :func:`~app.services.recurrence.cadence_options`, derived from the same
    producer this asks, so no combination a user can assemble by clicking
    arrives here refused.  It is what a hand-assembled POST meets, and it is why
    the write door's
    :class:`~app.services.recurrence.RecurrenceResolutionError` stays a
    broken-invariant 500 rather than becoming a user-facing path.

    Skipped when NO unit is named: "does not repeat" is the absence of a
    cadence, and a partial update that omits the recurrence keys leaves the
    stored one alone.

    **A named unit with no placement is REFUSED rather than skipped**, and two
    independent adversarial reviews of plan step R7b-2 found the same 500 in
    the version that skipped it.  The two axes are halves of one value, not two
    optional refinements: both write doors pop the placement with no default,
    so half a cadence reached ``build_recurrence_rule_from_form`` as an
    unhandled ``KeyError``.  Its EMPTY spelling was worse -- the field is
    ``allow_none``, so :func:`_normalize_empty_inputs` keeps the key with a
    present ``None``, marshmallow never deserializes it, and the route built a
    spec with ``placement=None`` that RESOLVED (the ``PERIOD`` unit's anchor
    does not read the placement) and then died inside the write door's
    completeness refusal, which was ``encode_cadence`` then and is
    :func:`~app.services.recurrence.require_authorable_cadence` now.  That is
    precisely the refusal this function exists to turn into a field error,
    arriving as a 500 instead.

    It is defect **D13**'s shape one field over, and the transfer route's own
    docstring records that one: ``recurrence_pattern`` was ``allow_none`` while
    a comment claimed it required, so an omitted key 500'd there too.  Refusing
    the pair HERE rather than defaulting the placement in the route is what
    stops a rule being authored from a cadence the user only half stated -- a
    default would pick which paycheck pays a bill on the user's behalf.

    **A named unit with no INTERVAL is refused for the same reason, from plan
    step R7c-c, and until then it was DEFAULTED TO 1 in three places** -- here,
    and in each write door's ``pop``.  That default moved money: R7c-c replaced
    the months ``<select>`` (which cannot post an empty value) with one free
    ``<input type="number">``, so clearing the box on a quarterly bill dropped
    the key -- ``interval_n`` is not ``allow_none``, so
    :func:`_normalize_empty_inputs` removes it rather than keeping a stated
    ``None`` -- and the save silently re-cadenced the rule to every 1 month,
    generating 12 occurrences a year where 4 were owed, across the whole
    projection.  The shape was already reachable for the PERIOD unit's free box
    before R7c-c; freeing the interval widened it to every unit.

    **Absence is refused rather than read as "leave the stored one alone"**,
    which is the opposite of what ``starts_on`` and the closing bound do, and
    the difference is which states the CONTROL can produce.  Those two are
    disabled on a form whose value the app DERIVES (a loan payment's), so
    "not mine to state" is a real third state and the update door honours it.
    The interval box is disabled only while the definition does not repeat
    (``_recurrence_fields.html``; ``recurrence_form.js`` re-enables it for
    every chosen cadence), so beside a named unit there is no producer of an
    absent interval except a cleared box or a hand-assembled POST.  Two states,
    not three -- so this field is not one of plan ledger row **D36**'s, and
    refusing states its real arity instead of adding a fourth hand-written
    presence read at a route site, which is what D36 warns against.

        ``budget.recurrence_rules.starts_on`` is ``NOT NULL`` from plan step

        merely a required field, it is the whole of what the rule says about
        when it begins.  Without this the omission would reach the write door
        as a ``RecurrenceResolutionError``, which routes turn into a flash
        rather than a field error.

        **A money decision, not a typing one.**  An empty opening bound used to
        mean "start with the schedule", and the create routes generate with no
        lower window bound -- so a ``$2,000.00`` rent template created today
        wrote five backdated rows into pay periods that had already closed
        (measured at plan step R7b-4).  A required first occurrence makes that
        state unreachable rather than defended against.

        **It applies to a CREATE and not to an UPDATE** (developer ruling
        2026-08-15), which is the split :attr:`recurrence_start_is_required`
        carries.  The harm above is a create's: an update edits a rule that
        already HAS a start, so an unstated one leaves that value alone and
        backdates nothing.  Requiring it on both is what made a loan payment's
        locked control unsubmittable -- the app derives that bound, so its form
        may not state one, and the only ways to satisfy a required field there
        were to post the derived value back (making "not mine to state"
        indistinguishable from a deliberate choice) or to lock the user out of
        renaming their own loan payment.

        An update that adds a cadence to a template which had none DOES author
        a rule, and the schema cannot see that -- it has no template.  The
        route can, and
        ``_recurrence_form_helpers.resolve_recurrence_rule_for_update`` refuses
        it there with the same message.

        Both fields are read from the payload rather than from the schema's

        cadence authors no rule, and a partial update that omits every
        recurrence key must stay a partial update.

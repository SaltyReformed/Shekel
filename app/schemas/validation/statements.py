Shekel Budget App -- Statement Import Validation Schema

The upload form's one schema.  ``docs/coding-standards.md``: *"Marshmallow
schema for every state-changing route... No manual ``request.form.get()`` with
inline try/except."*  A file upload is no exemption -- the source field is a
closed enumeration, and validating it here rather than in the route is what
keeps the route's job to ownership, the unit of work and the flash.

**The offer set is the ADAPTER REGISTRY, resolved at validation time.**  It is
not a literal list here and not a second copy of the enum: a source whose
parser has not been written must be unofferable AND unsubmittable from the same
fact, or the two drift and a tampered form reaches a parser that does not exist.

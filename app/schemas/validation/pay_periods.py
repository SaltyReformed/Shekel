"""Pay-period generation and lifecycle validation schemas.

The bounds every field here applies are NAMED rather than repeated, and plan
step **X-ad-a** is why: registration became a fifth door onto the same two
rules, so a literal copied once more would have been five statements of one
bound.  Each pair is imported from whoever OWNS the rule rather than restated
here -- the batch pair from the module that says what one batch may be,
which the writer asks before its transaction does the work
(:data:`~app.services.pay_period_batch.PERIOD_BATCH_MIN` /
:data:`~app.services.pay_period_batch.PERIOD_BATCH_MAX`), and, since plan step
**balance:X-bh-2**, the pay-history window from :mod:`app.utils.dates` --
which is not a column's bound at all but how far this application's calendar
reaches, mirrored onto ``ck_pay_schedule_history_opens_range`` for the writers
that never see a schema.  A schema is a door, and a door does not get to
invent the rule it enforces.

*TWO pairs here, where this paragraph counted three until plan step*
``pay_calendar:C17-d-3`` *moved the rhythm's -- the cadence pair, and the
day-of-month pair that step added -- to* :mod:`~app.schemas.validation._pay_rhythm`
*with the fields that read them, when this module met pylint's 1,000-line
cap.  The number is restated rather than left to decay, which is the same
discipline* :data:`app.utils.dates.CALENDAR_DATE_MIN`'s *own comment
follows.*

**The RHYTHM every door here states is declared once, in
:mod:`app.schemas.validation._pay_rhythm`** (plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-d-3``,
ruling **R-PC84**): the kind control and its arms' inputs, the convention,
the wire vocabulary, the cross-field rule and the mixins that put them on a
schema.  A door that establishes a rhythm takes
:class:`~app.schemas.validation._pay_rhythm.DefaultedRhythmFields`, a door
that corrects one takes
:class:`~app.schemas.validation._pay_rhythm.RequiredRhythmFields`, and each
reads the value back as ``rhythm`` off its loaded payload.

    The four doors that state a payday -- registration's *last payday*,

    being survivable when a payday is DISPLACED: the shift reads
    :func:`~app.utils.business_days.federal_holidays`, which computes the
    FOLLOWING year's New Year spillover, so a stated payday in year 9999 leaves
    ``datetime``'s own domain and raises ``ValueError`` -- not
    ``ValidationError`` -- out of the service tier and into a 500 on a public
    form.  ``is_business_day``'s docstring says the bound is stated rather than
    guarded because "no in-app caller can reach that"; ``C14-e-3`` made a
    caller that can, and an adversarial review of that step found it.  The

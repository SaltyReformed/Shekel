#
# A transcribed stub is posted as scalars plus three FAMILIES of figures whose
# members the owner's data decides (one input per paycheck line, one per tax,
# a few one-off rows), so the route reads each family's inputs off the form
# and loads every member through the one schema below that states its value
# rule.  What the figures must add up to, and which names clash, is the
# service's (``app.services.pay_stub_service``): those are rules about the
# owner's lines, not about a field.

#: A stub's payday is a date the pay calendar can walk to: an HTML date input
#: accepts a five-digit-year typo, and ``9999-12-31`` overflows the calendar's
#: forward projection (``app.utils.dates``, whose constants these are).

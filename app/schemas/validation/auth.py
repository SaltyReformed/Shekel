# --- Auth and companion user management ----------------------------------
#
# Email regex and password length rules are shared between the auth
# blueprint (login, register, change_password, MFA flows) and the
# companion-management routes so both code paths accept the same set
# of addresses and enforce the same bcrypt-bounded password rules.
# The 72-byte ceiling is bcrypt's hard input cap (see
# ``auth_service.hash_password``); inputs longer than that would be
# silently truncated and could not be reproduced at verify time
# without the same truncation.  The 12-character minimum matches
# ``auth_service.register_user`` and ``auth_service.change_password``.
#
# Commit C-26 of the 2026-04-15 security remediation plan promotes
# these constants out of the companion-only namespace so every auth
# schema can reuse them.  Companion-specific schemas continue to use
# the same constants.
#
# F-163 (Low) bounds backup_code at 32 characters so a megabyte-sized
# string cannot reach the bcrypt verifier on the /mfa/verify path; the
# real backup codes are 28 hex characters, so 32 is generous without
# admitting any DoS surface.  TOTP codes are exactly 6 digits.

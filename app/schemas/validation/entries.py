    Requires amount (>= 0.01), description (1--200 chars), and

    **The ``>= 0.01`` bound is THIS FORM's rule and not the table's** (ruling
    **bank_import:R-II**).  ``transaction_entries`` requires only ``amount
    <> 0``, because a merchant credit files as a NEGATIVE purchase; what makes
    a typed negative wrong HERE is that a form takes a MAGNITUDE.  The
    bank-import door does not pass through this schema and is the caller that
    legitimately writes a signed figure
    (``statement_match._create._born_purchase``).

    **``direction`` is how a refund is stated, and it is why the bound can
    stay** (developer ruling **bank_import:R-IK**, 2026-09-01, plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``).
    A purchase's sign is composed by
    :func:`~app.services.entry_service.purchase_amount` from this pair, so a
    minus is not refused here -- it is unrepresentable, on both this form and
    :class:`EntryUpdateSchema`.  It defaults to ``charge`` because that is what
    a purchase form is for and an omitted control must not silently mean the
    rarer, money-moving answer.

    **``settled_on`` is deliberately absent from the CREATE door.**  It records
    the day the user SAW the purchase on a bank statement, and at the moment a
    purchase is entered there is nothing to have seen.  It is set later, either
    by ticking the purchase at a balance true-up or by editing the entry -- see
    :class:`EntryUpdateSchema`.  Offering it here would invite a value that is
    a forecast rather than an observation.

    #
    # Its history is the argument.  ``Range(min=0.01)`` stood here until ruling
    # **bank_import:R-II**, then came off because the inline form renders
    # ``value="{{ entry.amount }}"`` and submits every control it holds -- so a
    # stored refund could not be re-described or re-dated while the box refused
    # a negative.  That was a real defect and the remedy was aimed at the wrong
    # tier: it deleted a domain rule to fix a FORM that validates a field the
    # owner did not touch.
    #
    # What it cost, and this door is reached ONLY by the human PATCH route
    # (``routes/entries.py`` builds the one instance) -- the bank-import door
    # writes through ``entry_service`` and passes no schema at all.  So both
    # doors carrying this rule are doors a person types at, and one of them had
    # no bound: a typed ``-45.00`` where ``45.00`` was meant booked a REFUND in
    # silence, moved the projection by twice the figure, and said nothing on
    # any screen -- while the identical keystroke on the add form 180 lines
    # below was a 422.

    # without a direction cannot be composed, so it is refused rather than

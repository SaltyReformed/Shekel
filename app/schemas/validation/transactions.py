    **Loaded for a row whose item is NOT editable at the popover** -- a
    recurring definition's generated row -- and inherited by
    :class:`TransactionItemUpdateSchema` for every other row.  The two
    tracking / visibility flags left this schema at plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-7b`` (ruling **R-BAL20**): a generated row reads them off
    its definition, so a flag posted for such a row reached only the sealed,
    dead cell on the row -- finding **BAL-484**'s writer.  Declared nowhere on
    this schema, that write is unrepresentable through the PATCH door rather
    than refused by a gate: ``Meta.unknown`` is ``EXCLUDE``.

    ``name`` and ``category_id`` stay here.  A one-off's are its
    DEFINITION's and the door lands them there
    (``routes/transactions/_field_updates``); a legacy link-less row's are
    its own until the family's cutover; a generated row's are its
    definition's too, and a crafted PATCH still writes the row's copy, which
    the next regeneration rewrites -- the same shape the due-date gate
    closed for that field and no step has yet closed for these two.

    ``version_id`` is the optimistic-locking counter from the row at
    the moment the cell or popover was rendered.  The route handler
    compares the submitted value against ``Transaction.version_id``
    and short-circuits with 409 Conflict if they differ -- a stale-
    form check that catches the Tab-1/Tab-2 race even when the two
    requests are sequential rather than truly concurrent.  Optional
    so callers without a way to plumb the version through still
    pass validation; in that case only the SQLAlchemy
    ``version_id_col`` race detection applies, which catches the
    truly-concurrent case at flush time.  See commit C-18 of the
    2026-04-15 security remediation plan.

    Used by ``transactions.mark_done`` (both transfer-shadow and

    panel's amount boxes
    (``routes.accounts.reconcile._submitted_corrections``) -- the same
    question feeding the same parameter of the same verb, so one field
    declaration answers it.  Marshmallow's Decimal field rejects
    malformed numeric input with a clean field-level 400 instead of
    the route's catch-and-translate 400, and
    ``_NON_NEGATIVE_MONETARY`` is the schema-tier counterpart to the
    DB CHECK ``settled_amount IS NULL OR settled_amount >= 0`` on
    ``budget.transactions.settled_amount`` (the column was
    ``actual_amount`` until plan step X-au-c3 renamed it and paired it
    with ``settled_basis_id``).

    **Its UPPER bound is what plan step X-f2-c3 added, and the lower
    half alone was a 500.**  The column is ``numeric(12, 2)``, so a
    figure at or above ``10 ** 10`` cannot be stored: it passed the
    ``>= 0`` validator, reached the settle verb and raised
    ``psycopg2.errors.NumericValueOutOfRange`` at flush -- unhandled,
    so a 500 on a door an ordinary crafted POST reaches.  The reconcile
    panel commits a whole statement walk in ONE transaction, so a
    single unstorable box discarded every other tick submitted beside
    it.  Sharing the app's own monetary range rather than declaring a
    second one is the point: a bound this field states for itself is a
    second answer to "what is a valid money input", on a money path.
    50 of this package's 104 ``fields.Decimal`` declarations still carry
    no upper bound, which is ledger finding **N-256** rather than this
    step's to sweep.

    ``allow_none=True`` matches the column's nullability, and an HTML
    form submits every input including the empty ones, so an empty box
    loads as ``None`` and means "nobody typed a figure".

    **What ``None`` MEANS changed at plan step X-au-c3**, and this
    paragraph said the opposite until an adversarial review caught it
    (2026-08-18).  It used to mean "leave the column untouched", because
    a settled row recording nothing was a legal state and every reader
    fell back to the row's plan.  A settle now always RECORDS what
    moved, so ``None`` means "nobody typed one, so record what the
    settle resolved" -- the rule
    ``transaction_service.settle_transaction`` states in those words.

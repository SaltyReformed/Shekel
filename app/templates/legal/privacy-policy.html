    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 1, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        At Shekel Budget App, your privacy is our highest priority. This application is designed to be self-hosted,
        meaning that all your financial data remains local on your own machine. We do not collect, transmit, or store
        any personal or financial information externally.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        Shekel Budget App operates entirely on your local system. All data you enter into the app—including income
        details, expenses, and recurring schedules—is stored only on your device. No data is sent to remote servers or
        shared with any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Local Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the app is self-hosted, the security of your data depends on the security measures you have implemented on
        your machine. We recommend keeping your system updated and following best security practices to safeguard your
        information.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not use cookies or any tracking technologies to collect information. No usage data or analytics are
        transmitted externally.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Shekel Budget App is a standalone application and does not integrate with any third-party services for data
        collection or analytics. Any additional integrations you choose to add are entirely under your control and
        should be configured with your own privacy considerations.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in the application or legal
        requirements. When updates are made, the effective date at the top of this document will be revised. As an open
        source, self-hosted solution, you are free to modify the app and its privacy practices to suit your needs.
    </p>

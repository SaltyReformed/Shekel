"""Shared definitions for the side-record band rule: a transfer's records follow its status.

**A transfer's two side records are dated exactly while the transfer is
settled** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``, design D8; the drift the
balance arc's specification says is "made unrepresentable here").  A
transfer's status is ONE column on ``budget.transfers``, and each side's
payment record (``transaction_entries.expense_transfer_id`` /
``income_transfer_id``) carries that side's day.  The transfer writer moves
both together (``transfer_service._status.apply_status_to_all_three``), so
every state a door writes is one of three:

* **settled, both sides recorded** -- each side holds one DATED record;
* **settled, neither side recorded** -- a ``$0.00`` close (rulings
  **R-BAL82**, **R-BAL90**, **R-BAL141**: a close of nothing stores no record,
  no day and no link);
* **not settled** -- no side's record is dated; a revert keeps each record
  UN-dated (ruling **R-BAL61**).

Two states no door writes are what this rule refuses: a DATED record under a
transfer that is not settled (ruling **R-BAL79**'s "counted once" case, and
ruling **R-BAL140**'s reverse), and a settled transfer with an UN-dated
record, or a record on one side only (ruling **R-BAL147**'s
``UndatedSettleError``).  Until this rule the readers carried branches for
both, and the transfer service carried their repairs (``drifted_sides_only``
with ledger row **BAL-578**, the restore's status repair); the repairs went
with this rule, and the readers' branches are plan step ``X-bi-6-5``'s to
delete (finding **BAL-527**).

**The figure arm** (:data:`FIGURE_ARM`; plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``'s
4d-4 half, rulings **R-BAL365**, **R-BAL366**) ties the transfer's ONE settled
figure (``budget.transfers.settled_figure``) to the same records: a figure
above zero is recorded on BOTH sides, and a transfer recording neither side
stores no figure or -- a ``$0.00`` close -- ``0.00``.  A settled transfer
always states its figure, and a transfer that is not settled never holds
``0.00`` (ruling R-BAL365: "a revert of a $0.00 close clears it").  A side
record holds no figure of its own (``transaction_entries``'
``ck_transaction_entries_side_record_states_no_figure``), so this is the
rule that says WHICH transfers' records may exist at all.

**A deferred constraint trigger, because the rule is about two tables at
COMMIT.**  A settle writes the transfer's status, its figure and both
records in one unit of work, in an order the unit of work chooses; between
those statements the state is exactly what the rule forbids.  So the check
is asked of each transfer a statement touched, once the transaction
commits, against what is stored then.  **Every attachment but one carries a
``WHEN`` clause**: a deferred trigger without one queues an event on every
row it watches, and pending events block an ``ALTER TABLE`` later in the
same transaction (the lesson ``opening_infrastructure._movement`` records,
which broke CI twice).  An entry that links no transfer and a transfer whose
status and figure did not move queue nothing.  **The exception is a
transfer's INSERT** (the figure arm's): "settled" is a fact of a
``ref.statuses`` row, which a ``WHEN`` clause cannot read, so a transfer
inserted settled with no figure is graded only by an attachment that fires
on every insert (rulings **R-BAL339**: a refusal is the database's, and
**R-BAL357**: a database refusal is a backstop behind the create's own).
One event per inserted transfer, graded at commit; a later revision that
inserts transfers and then alters ``budget.transfers`` in one transaction
commits between the two.

**The arms are a LITERAL per revision** (:data:`BAND_ARM`,
:data:`FIGURE_ARM`, :data:`ALL_ARMS`), the precedent ``opening_infrastructure``
and ``deleted_row_infrastructure`` set: a migration imports the LIVE module,
and a chain replay of an old revision must install what that revision
declared, not what a later step added.  A revision passes the tuple it
censused; the two scripts that materialise a HEAD database pass
:data:`ALL_ARMS`.  The check function is COMPOSED from the arms
(:func:`_check_function_sql`), so a replay of ``e616adf7fe22``'s
``(BAND_ARM,)`` installs the band's text byte for byte.

**Three callers must produce identical infrastructure**, the contract
:mod:`app.append_only_infrastructure` states: the Alembic revisions that
install it (``e616adf7fe22`` the band, ``b7d2e4f19a63`` the figure arm),
``scripts/init_database.py`` and ``scripts/build_test_template.py``.  The
test image's check counts :data:`SIDE_BAND_TRIGGERS` on the baked template,
so a template missing an attachment is rebuilt rather than trusted.

**Caller contract: both tables and the side links must already exist.**

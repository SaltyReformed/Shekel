"""
Shekel Budget App -- Analytics Routes

Analytics dashboard whose four nav pills lazy-load one HTMX partial each:
Calendar, Spending, Statements, and Taxes (the Slice-4 shell collapse).  The
Statements pill groups the two confirmed-ledger reports (Income Statement and
Balance Sheet, Build-Order Step 5, via ``ledger_report_service``) behind one
internal toggle.  The Spending pill (Slice 3) replaced the Variance and Trends
pills and the Taxes pill (Slice 2) replaced Year-End; the retired
``/analytics/variance``, ``/analytics/trends``, and ``/analytics/year-end``
URLs now redirect to the main page (``retired_tab``) so old bookmarks do not
404.  Each tab pill pushes its own URL and a direct (non-HTMX) GET renders the
shell with that tab active rather than redirecting to Calendar (D13).  No
analytics export remains -- the last one, the calendar month/year CSV, was
removed with P-AN4.

def _validate_owned_or_abort(model, pk):
    """Validate that ``pk`` references a record owned by ``current_user``.

    Used at the top of analytics route handlers to enforce the
    project security response rule: "404 for both 'not found' and
    'not yours.'"  Without this guard the underlying services
    silently fall back to default data on a cross-user
    ``account_id`` (calendar) or read victim metadata into the
    response window label on a cross-user ``period_id`` (income
    statement), bypassing the access boundary documented in the
    project's auth-helper contract.

    Delegates the existence + ownership check to
    :func:`app.utils.auth_helpers.get_or_404`, which already emits
    the structured ``resource_not_found`` (INFO) and
    ``access_denied_cross_user`` (WARNING) audit events the SOC
    dashboards rely on.  This wrapper adds the abort so the route
    body can stay flat (``_validate_owned_or_abort(...)`` as a
    one-liner instead of an explicit ``if record is None: abort``
    branch in every handler).

    A ``pk`` of ``None`` means "query argument absent" -- bypass
    validation and let the caller's downstream logic supply a
    user-scoped default (e.g. the user's first active checking
    account, or the user's current pay period).  The caller MUST
    NOT attempt to use the return value when passing ``None``.

    Audit reference: F-039 + F-098 / commit C-30 of the
    2026-04-15 security remediation plan.

    Args:
        model: The SQLAlchemy model class to look up.  Must expose
            a ``user_id`` column (Pattern A in
            :mod:`app.utils.auth_helpers`).
        pk: The primary key value parsed from a query argument, or
            ``None`` when the argument was not supplied.

    Returns:
        The loaded record on a successful ownership check, or
        ``None`` when ``pk`` was ``None`` (no validation performed).

    Raises:
        werkzeug.exceptions.NotFound: When ``pk`` references a
            non-existent row OR a row owned by a different user.
            Both branches produce the same 404 so the client cannot
            distinguish "no such row" from "not yours" by response
            shape.

    """Parse and apply defaults for the window query parameters.

    The ``window`` / ``period_id`` / ``month`` / ``year`` parsing for the
    Income Statement tab, which discriminates a pay-period / month / year
    window (building a ``StatementWindow`` over the result).  Applies the
    defaults: a bare ``pay_period`` window resolves the user's current
    period (falling back to their most recent, then to a month window when
    the user has no periods at all); a bare ``month`` / ``year`` window fills
    *today*'s fields.  A calendar ``month`` / ``year`` is range-clamped here
    (month to 1-12, year to 2000-2100, the ``calendar_tab`` convention) so a
    hand-crafted out-of-range value cannot reach ``date()`` /
    ``calendar.monthrange()`` in the statement service and raise; the clamp
    is a no-op for the in-range defaults and for the ``pay_period`` window
    (whose ``month`` / ``year`` stay ``None``).

    **Both period reads come off the CALENDAR the caller derived** (plan step
    C2-f3a).  ``period_containing`` is the SAVED-only search, which is exactly
    what ``pay_period_service.get_current_period`` answered -- not
    ``span_containing``, whose projection past the horizon carries
    ``period_id = None`` and would put a ``None`` into ``StatementWindow`` that
    reads as "no window chosen".  The fall-through to a MONTH window for an
    owner with no periods at all is preserved and is why ``None`` here must
    stay a real answer.

    Args:
        calendar: The render's :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar`,
            derived once by the caller.

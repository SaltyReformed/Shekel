    **The form's read-only replacement for the ``pay_periods_per_year``
    dropdown** (plan step R-F16).  It is the count of the owner's LATEST
    rhythm (``resolve_cadence``).  A yearly figure is a pay times the count
    in force on ITS payday (ruling **R-SAL59**; since plan step salary:X-av-2
    each payday's own, **R-SAL66**), which is this number for an owner with
    one rhythm and not, before the change, for an owner with a later one
    recorded; the pay list states each entry's own count beside it.  It is
    not the owner's to choose HERE: it derives from
    the owner's pay era's cadence (``budget.pay_eras`` since plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C17-a``; ``budget.pay_schedule.cadence_days`` until then),
    which the pay-period settings own, and offering a second control was the
    finding.

    ``None`` for an owner with no resolvable cadence, which the template
    renders as a pointer to generate a schedule.  Answered rather than raised:
    a form page must not 500 on the state the form itself is the fix for, and
    such an owner cannot create a profile either way (``_paycheck_template``
    needs a payday to seat the recurrence on).

    **Through ``resolve_cadence`` rather than ``cadence_for`` or a whole
    calendar**, and the two doors beside it are why each is wrong here.
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.cadence_for` REFUSES the unresolvable
    owner, which is right for a producer of money and wrong for a form.
    **Since plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-d`` (ruling R-PC45) so does**
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for` -- this paragraph said it
    "answers without refusing", which was true of the empty cadence-less
    calendar that step deleted and is now false of both calendar doors.  It
    remains the wrong door here for its OTHER stated reason, which the step did
    not touch: it derives the owner's whole payday set to answer, 61 rows on
    production, on two pages that load a calendar for nothing else.
    ``resolve_cadence`` is the SOFT door and is what this form wants -- the one
    fact both of those read, asked directly, and answered rather than raised.
    *Since plan step salary:R15-b the same page DOES derive the owner's
    calendar whenever a deduction line carries a cadence rule
    (``_helpers._line_cadence_phrases``: a rule is described against
    it, and a rule is authored against one, so that derivation cannot meet
    the refusal).*  **And since plan step salary:X-av-3a the EDIT page
    derives it on every render**, for the pay list and the rhythm notice
    (``edit_profile``), so for that page this soft read no longer spares the
    owner with no schedule: the calendar door refuses one first.  No such
    owner reaches it -- the create door derives the same calendar and no
    door deletes a schedule -- and the NEW-profile page, which derives the
    calendar only after this read finds a cadence, is where it still
    answers rather than raises.

    owner's paycheck count -- and re-stated at the net a few lines later in

    **The calendar is TAKEN rather than derived here** (pay-calendar plan step

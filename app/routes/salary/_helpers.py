Shekel Budget App -- Salary route package: shared helpers.

Marshmallow schema singletons, form-field allowlists, unique-constraint
name constants, and the private helpers shared across the salary route
sub-modules (transaction regeneration, the calibration taxable-base and
rate-consistency helpers, and the HTMX-partial / redirect responders).
Constructed once at import time so every handler reuses the same
instances, preserving the pre-split monolith's behaviour.

    The shared ownership gate for the two routes keyed on both a profile
    and a period -- the cockpit's anatomy fragment

    redirect stub (:func:`app.routes.salary.views.breakdown`).  Verifies
    each id belongs to the current user BEFORE the caller acts, so a
    cross-user id 404s here per the project's "404 for both 'not found'
    and 'not yours'" rule rather than leaking existence.

    **The PERIOD half is now structural** (pay-calendar plan step C2-f2d-3).
    It was ``get_or_404(PayPeriod, period_id)`` -- a read of the global table
    with the owner compared afterwards.  The calendar holds ONE owner's
    paydays, so another owner's id is not found-and-rejected here; it is
    absent, and the 404 falls out of the lookup rather than out of a
    comparison a later edit could drop.
    **What that move COST, and what pays it back**: ``get_or_404`` emits an
    access event on each of its two denial branches, and for one commit the
    calendar's refusal emitted nothing, so a cross-user id probe against these
    two routes was silent in the audit log (adversarial code review, 2026-08-16).
    :func:`~app.utils.auth_helpers.log_refused_lookup` restores the trail at the

    Args:
        profile_id: Primary key of the requested salary profile.
        period_id: Primary key of the requested pay period.
        calendar: The current user's

            parameter rather than derived here because both callers need the
            same calendar for the paycheck engine beside this call, and one
            derivation per request is the rule this arc is applying
            everywhere.

    Returns:
        A ``(profile, period)`` tuple -- the :class:`SalaryProfile` and the
        :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod`, both the current
        user's.

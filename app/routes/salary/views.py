"""
Shekel Budget App -- Salary route package: projection view + breakdown stubs.

The full-width multi-period salary projection table (a first-class sibling
of the cockpit), plus the retired per-period breakdown URLs, which now
redirect into the cockpit (the paycheck anatomy lives there).  The old
breakdown pages were folded into the cockpit during the Fable 5 salary
rebuild; the endpoint names are preserved as ownership-checked redirect
stubs so existing bookmarks and in-app links keep resolving.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Salary route package: line items (raises + payroll lines).

Add, edit, and delete the two parallel families of salary line item -- pay
raises and payroll LINES (deductions and, since plan step salary:R18-b,
earnings; ruling **R-SAL38**) -- both of which regenerate the linked
salary transactions on every change.  The two families are deliberately
co-located and kept as explicit parallel implementations: they differ on
the model, schema, percentage conversion, unique constraint, user-facing
messages, and HTMX partial, so a single generic CRUD helper would couple
two distinct domains behind a many-parameter interface (a worse
abstraction than the parallel code).  The shared cross-cutting concern --
committing the regenerated transactions and reporting every recoverable
failure (the stale-lock conflict, the expected unique-constraint
collision, and other DB errors) -- IS factored out, through
:func:`app.routes._commit_helpers.regenerate_commit_or_report`.

) -> None:
    """Write into the payload what the line form leaves to the app about its rule.

    The line form authors a cadence through the shared recurrence controls
    (plan step salary:R15-c, ruling **R-SAL31**) and, since plan step
    salary:R18-c (ruling **R-SAL38** (2), amending R-SAL30 and R-SAL31), a
    SPAN: a "Starts on" that may be left blank and an optional closing bound.
    Before the recurrence seam reads the payload the way it reads a template
    form's, the two facts a payroll line's rule derives are written in,
    exactly as ``_loan_destination.settle_first_occurrence`` writes a loan
    payment's derived start into a transfer form's payload:

    * a BLANK ``starts_on`` -- the STORED unit's zero at the owner's opening
      payday (rulings **R-SAL30**, **R-SAL36**;
      :func:`~app.services.payroll_line_cadence.first_occurrence`, which reads
      the unit the door canonicalises to, so "every 12 months" and the
      ``YEAR`` its edit form reads back derive one day).  A STATED start is
      the user's and passes through untouched, so the seam's own start
      handling applies unchanged: a create authors it, an update re-points
      the rule onto it (PRESENT replaces), and a cleared box on an edit is
      back to the default.
    * the every-paycheck spelling -- ``every 1 paycheck, no ceiling``, with
      NO SPAN -- is rewritten as NO cadence (ruling **R-SAL29**;
      :func:`~app.services.payroll_line_cadence.is_every_paycheck`), which the
      seam reads as *author nothing* on a create and *delete the rule this
      line had* on an update.  A span is ANY stated start, or a closing bound
      other than *never*: an every-paycheck line that begins or ends
      mid-employment IS a rule, and keeps one.  A stated start is a span
      even when it names the opening payday, and an adversarial review of
      this leaf is why: below a STATED ``history_opens_on`` the engine
      replays backdated paydays for a capped line's year-to-date and the FICA
      cumulative, and there a line with NO rule answers *taken* while a rule
      from the opening answers *not taken* (the rule's walk runs forward from
      its start) -- so two spellings a first draft called equivalent price
      differently, and a typed date must not pick the side silently.  What
      *every paycheck* means below the opening is the developer's question,
      not this door's.  The ceiling and the bound are read the way the seam's
      update door reads them: a PRESENT key (an enabled control, possibly
      cleared) is what the form said, an ABSENT one (a control the form
      disabled, or a crafted POST) leaves the STORED value standing -- so a
      24 line re-saved with the key missing is still the 24 shape, and a
      bounded line re-saved with the bound's keys missing keeps its stop
      rather than losing its rule.
    * a derived start carries NO nominal day: the derived zero -- a payday,
      the 1st, January 1st -- never clamps, and a nominal day posted beside a
      blank start (a crafted POST; the script disables the control) would
      otherwise reach the spec as a pair it refuses as a broken invariant.

    A submission that names no cadence is left alone: ``None`` is the form's
    "Does not repeat", and an ABSENT unit is a form that said nothing about
    the cadence (a page cached from before this deploy, a crafted POST),
    which the update route reads as "leave the stored rule alone".  Nothing
    is derived for either, and the calendar is not loaded for either -- the
    pass memoises it, so the one call below is the only derivation the
    pre-write side makes.

    Args:
        data: The schema-loaded payload, mutated in place.
        ctx: The read pass the route built before any write; its

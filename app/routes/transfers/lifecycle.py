"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer route package: a template's LIFECYCLE.

The three doors that move a transfer template between its states -- archive,
unarchive and hard-delete -- split out of the sibling module
:mod:`app.routes.transfers.templates` at plan step R7d-g-2 (developer ruling
**R-R84**, 2026-09-13), where they had lived since the package split, when
that module stood at pylint's 1,000-line cap with this leaf's edits to every
one of them still to land.  A pure move first (graded by AST: every definition
identical, code and docstrings, nothing new), then the step.  Every URL and
endpoint name is preserved verbatim, so no ``url_for`` site or template
changed.

The three are one concern: which of the template's ``budget.transfers`` rows
still stand for it.  Archiving soft-deletes its projected rows that hold
nothing (and their shadow pairs, through the transfer service), unarchiving
restores them and fills forward, and hard-delete either destroys the
unsettled rows with the template or -- where settled history stands, or a
leg holds a payment (plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``) -- falls back to
the archive (:func:`_archive`, the one spelling both archive arms share).  What the
template IS (its CRUD routes, its form payload, its recurrence rule) stays in
``templates.py``, and what happens to a NON-repeating template's single row on
an edit is :mod:`app.routes.transfers._instances`.

**Every door here can change WHICH transfer is a loan's standing payment**
(plan step R7d-g-2, ruling **R-R85**), and the standing payment's ``starts_on``
is a stored derived value (ruling **R-R29**: the loan's first contractual
installment, the cadence anchor a month-unit rule cannot fire without).
Archiving or deleting the standing payment PROMOTES the next-oldest active
transfer into the loan; unarchiving makes the restored transfer standing
again -- or newly, when it is older than the live payment, since the seam
names the oldest active one.  So each door, once its write is flushed, calls
the ONE entry helper
(:func:`~app.routes._standing_payment.sync_loan_payment_start_or_refuse`),
which asks the seam who is standing NOW and brings that definition's start
onto the contract.  A stop the promoted or restored definition's owner
authored earlier is HONOURED (ruling **R-R82**); the one pair the window
CHECK refuses -- that start moved past that stop -- refuses the door whole,
naming the transfer.

**The version-pinned write lands at the first flush, under the guard.**  Each
door dirties the template, and the transfer service's soft-deletes and
restores flush; the standing-payment lookup autoflushes too.  Until this step
the archive and unarchive doors guarded only their commit, so a concurrent
edit surfaced as an unhandled ``StaleDataError`` whenever the template had a
row to soft-delete.  :func:`~app.routes._commit_helpers.flush_or_handle_stale`
now lands the pinned statement first, where the race can be reported.

    The one spelling of the archive both :func:`archive_transfer_template`
    and :func:`hard_delete_transfer_template`'s history arm run (it was
    written out twice until plan step R7d-g-2).  Three steps, in the one
    order they can run in:

    1. ``is_active = False``, FLUSHED under the stale guard: the
       version-pinned ``UPDATE`` lands here, before the service's soft-deletes
       flush and before anything reads the active set.
    2. Every projected, non-deleted transfer of the template that HOLDS
       NOTHING is soft-deleted THROUGH the transfer service, so its two
       shadow transactions go with it (the three-level cascade: template
       archival -> transfer soft-delete -> shadow soft-delete).  **A transfer
       either of whose legs holds a payment is kept** (plan step
       ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``, rulings **R-CC63**, **R-CC65**): a
       Projected leg holds one only as a reverted settle's kept payment, which
       may still be matched to the bank's line, and a row holding a movement
       is history the archive leaves as it is
       (``archive_helpers.transfer_holds_nothing``).  Routed through the
       centralized ``is_projected_clause`` (D6-09 / MED-02) parameterised on
       ``Transfer`` so the rule "what does a Projected filter look like in
       SQL" is shared with the Transaction filter sites.
    3. The loan this template pays into, if it is one, has its standing
       payment re-derived (ruling **R-R85**): with this template out of the
       active set the next-oldest transfer into the loan is PROMOTED and its
       start becomes the contract's -- honouring a stop its owner authored
       (ruling **R-R82**), or refusing the archive whole where the derived

         transfer_service.delete_transfer(soft=False).

         deletion is routed through transfer_service.delete_transfer().
      5. Balance calculator queries only budget.transactions -- after
         deletion, shadow transactions no longer exist in the table.

      - History exists (Paid transfers, or a transfer whose leg holds a

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer route package: a template's LIFECYCLE.

The three doors that move a transfer template between its states -- archive,
unarchive and hard-delete -- split out of the sibling module
:mod:`app.routes.transfers.templates` at plan step R7d-g-2 (developer ruling
**R-R84**, 2026-09-13), where they had lived since the package split, when
that module stood at pylint's 1,000-line cap with this leaf's edits to every
one of them still to land.  A pure move first (graded by AST: every definition
identical, code and docstrings, nothing new), then the step.  Every URL and
endpoint name is preserved verbatim, so no ``url_for`` site or template
changed.

The three are one concern: which of the template's ``budget.transfers`` rows
still stand for it.  Archiving soft-deletes its projected rows (and their
shadow pairs, through the transfer service), unarchiving restores them and
fills forward, and hard-delete either destroys the unsettled rows with the
template or -- where settled history stands -- falls back to the archive
(:func:`_archive`, the one spelling both archive arms share).  What the
template IS (its CRUD routes, its form payload, its recurrence rule) stays in
``templates.py``, and what happens to a NON-repeating template's single row on
an edit is :mod:`app.routes.transfers._instances`.

**Every door here can change WHICH transfer is a loan's standing payment**
(plan step R7d-g-2, ruling **R-R85**), and the standing payment's ``starts_on``
is a stored derived value (ruling **R-R29**: the loan's first contractual
installment, the cadence anchor a month-unit rule cannot fire without).
Archiving or deleting the standing payment PROMOTES the next-oldest active
transfer into the loan; unarchiving makes the restored transfer standing
again -- or newly, when it is older than the live payment, since the seam
names the oldest active one.  So each door, once its write is flushed, calls
the ONE entry helper
(:func:`~app.routes._standing_payment.sync_loan_payment_start_or_refuse`),
which asks the seam who is standing NOW and brings that definition's start
onto the contract.  A stop the promoted or restored definition's owner
authored earlier is HONOURED (ruling **R-R82**); the one pair the window
CHECK refuses -- that start moved past that stop -- refuses the door whole,
naming the transfer.

**The version-pinned write lands at the first flush, under the guard.**  Each
door dirties the template, and the transfer service's soft-deletes and
restores flush; the standing-payment lookup autoflushes too.  Until this step
the archive and unarchive doors guarded only their commit, so a concurrent
edit surfaced as an unhandled ``StaleDataError`` whenever the template had a
row to soft-delete.  :func:`~app.routes._commit_helpers.flush_or_handle_stale`
now lands the pinned statement first, where the race can be reported.

    order they can run in:

    1. ``is_active = False``, FLUSHED under the stale guard: the
       version-pinned ``UPDATE`` lands here, before the service's soft-deletes
       flush and before anything reads the active set.
    2. Every projected, non-deleted transfer of the template is soft-deleted

       (the three-level cascade: template archival -> transfer soft-delete ->
       shadow soft-delete).  Routed through the centralized
       ``is_projected_clause`` (D6-09 / MED-02) parameterised on ``Transfer``
       so the rule "what does a Projected filter look like in SQL" is shared
       with the Transaction filter sites.
    3. The loan this template pays into, if it is one, has its standing
       payment re-derived (ruling **R-R85**): with this template out of the
       active set the next-oldest transfer into the loan is PROMOTED and its
       start becomes the contract's -- honouring a stop its owner authored

    Maintains all five transfer invariants from CLAUDE.md:
      1. Two linked shadows per transfer -- CASCADE on Transaction.transfer_id
         removes both shadows when the parent Transfer is hard-deleted via
         transfer_service.delete_transfer(soft=False).
      2. No orphaned shadows -- shadows are removed atomically with their
         parent transfer through the service's CASCADE verification.
      3. Amount/status/period parity -- not applicable; entire records are
         removed, not mutated.
      4. All mutations through the transfer service -- every transfer
         deletion is routed through transfer_service.delete_transfer().
      5. Balance calculator queries only budget.transactions -- after
         deletion, shadow transactions no longer exist in the table.

    Two-path logic:
      - History exists (Paid transfers): permanent deletion is
        blocked.  Template is archived instead (if not already) and the
        user is warned (:func:`_archive_instead_of_delete`).
      - No history: linked transfers are hard-deleted through the
        transfer service (which CASCADE-deletes shadows), then the

    once the template's ``DELETE`` has flushed.  Decomposed into the two arms
    at plan step R7d-g-2, when that second sync made a seventh return.

    settled transfers via the semantic ``Status.is_settled`` boolean,

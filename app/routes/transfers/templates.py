"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer route package: template management.

CRUD for recurring transfer templates: list, create, edit and update, plus
the update-acceptance gate and the regenerate-and-commit step.  Every URL and
endpoint name is preserved verbatim from the pre-split
``app/routes/transfers.py``.

What happens to the ``budget.transfers`` ROWS a template stands for --
materializing them on create, and carrying an edit onto a non-repeating
template's single Transfer -- is the sibling module
:mod:`app.routes.transfers._instances`, split out at plan step R2e-3 when this
one reached the 1,000-line module cap.  The template's LIFECYCLE doors --
archive, unarchive and hard-delete -- are :mod:`app.routes.transfers.lifecycle`,
split out at plan step R7d-g-2 (ruling **R-R84**) when it reached the cap
again.

    """Refuse, or settle, everything the create payload REFERS to.

    One step rather than three consecutive guards, and the reason is the route
    rather than the count: each of these asks whether a submitted reference is
    the current user's to use, and the last one READS the destination it has
    just checked.  Splitting them across the route left three
    ``return redirect`` arms in a function whose own docstring records the
    single-return FK loop it already grew for the same reason -- and plan step
    R7c-b's fourth arm pushed it past pylint's ``too-many-return-statements``.
    Decomposing is this project's answer to that count, never a disable.

    Three things, in the one order they can be asked in:

    1. **Every user-scoped FK is the owner's** (commit C-27 / F-043).  A
       single-return loop so a future FK adds a row rather than an arm; the
       message-per-FK detail rides on the label.
    2. **The pay period a NON-REPEATING transfer lands in** is the owner's too,
       and this is the ONE place the request asks (plan step
       ``pay_calendar:C13-b``).  It was ``_user_owns(PayPeriod, ...)`` -- fetch
       the row by primary key, compare its ``user_id`` -- and
       ``_materialize_one_time_transfer`` then did the same again on the row
       this one had already cleared.  Now the owner's derived CALENDAR is
       asked once, where an id another user holds is simply ABSENT, and the
       RESOLVED period is threaded to that materializer, which re-fetches
       nothing.  ``transfer_service`` still asks its own tier's question, which
       is the guarantee a caller skipping this route cannot escape.
       Owner-checked at the route since plan step R7b-4: the check used to live
       inside the recurrence-form helper (``recurrence_spec_from_form``
       since plan step R-F6), because the same ``<select>``
       was ALSO the recurrence's "First paycheck" and a cross-user period would
       have shifted this owner's generation timing.  The recurrence takes a
       DATE now, so the field has one job and one owner.  Guarded on presence
       rather than folded into the loop, because it is OPTIONAL: a repeating
       transfer submits no period at all.  Resolved unconditionally when
       present, so a crafted POST pairing a foreign period with a repeating
       cadence is refused rather than ignored.
    3. **A loan destination's first occurrence is DERIVED where the
       definition would be its standing payment**, settled before the rule
       is built so nothing is authored and then replaced (plan step R7c-b,
       developer ruling 2026-08-15; the ``bind_rule_to_loan`` that replaced
       it went at plan step R7d-g-2, ruling **R-R85**); a stop stated for
       such a loan is REFUSED there too (plan step R7d-f-3, ruling
       **R-R60**); and a SECOND transfer's owner-typed start is refused at
       or before the loan's origination (ruling **R-R81**).  It runs LAST
       because it reads the destination's loan parameters, which step 1 has
       just proved are the owner's -- reading them first would be an IDOR.

    Args:
        data: The validated payload, mutated in place by step 3.
        start_period_id: The submitted pay period, already popped from *data*
            by the caller, or ``None``.

    Returns:
        ``(start_period, refusal)``.  *start_period* is the resolved
        :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` the caller threads to
        :func:`~._instances.materialize_initial_transfers`, or ``None`` when
        the submission named no period.  *refusal* is ``None`` when every
        reference checks out and *data* is ready to build, else the redirect
        the caller returns verbatim.

    Raises:
        PayCalendarError: When the owner holds no pay schedule, from the
            calendar this resolves against.  Uncaught, as at every other
            caller: the form that posts here rendered the owner's periods to

    onto the loan's contract (plan step R7d-g-2, ruling **R-R85**; the same
    entry helper every lifecycle door calls, and the one write this function
    makes before regenerating).  The edit it is for: the standing payment's
    cadence UNIT moving -- every paycheck to monthly would otherwise store a
    payday as the monthly day until the next params edit healed it.  For
    every other edit the producer finds the start in step, or no loan at
    all, and writes nothing: a rename costs it one lookup.  Its one refusal
    is the window CHECK's (ruling **R-R82**), worded whole, and it sends the
    user back to the edit form.

    THEN refuses a save that would STRAND a still-projected transfer of this
    definition -- one answering an occurrence the books drop, the later
    opening of its two accounts -- whatever field the edit changed (plan
    step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, rulings **R-PC90** / **R-PC91**;
    :func:`app.services.planned_rows_books.definition_edit_refusal`), because
    a maintain pass reaching that transfer retires it -- the one below, for
    a paycheck ending on or after *effective_from*.  AFTER the sync, because
    the sync can move the rule's first occurrence, and that moves which
    occurrences the save would leave: graded before it, the refusal would
    read a rule the save does not keep.  A refusal rolls the whole pending
    write back, the sync's included.

    Then re-runs ``transfer_recurrence.regenerate_for_template`` against the
    baseline scenario, diverting to the recurrence-conflict chooser when an
    amount change would overwrite hand-edited upcoming transfers, then
    commits.  Optimistic-lock and name-uniqueness failures at flush time are
    converted to the same flash + redirect the form-side guards produce, so a
    concurrent edit never surfaces as a 500.

    Args:
        template: The TransferTemplate whose field changes are already staged
            in the session.
        before: The template's pre-edit state
            (:class:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_helpers.PreEditTemplateState`)
            -- its amount gates the chooser and its ``had_recurrence_rule``
            gates the sweep; see :func:`regenerate_or_conflict_chooser`.
        effective_from: Date from which regeneration applies.
        template_id: The template's id, used for redirect kwargs and logging.
        pass_ctx: The route's PRE-WRITE read pass, which serves the
            stranded-row refusal.  Its resolution memo is keyed by the rule's
            spec and the definition's books, so the edited and synced rule
            resolves afresh; the calendar and the per-account opening memos
            are keyed by the owner and the account, and they serve the edited
            state only because an edit moves no payday and no opening.
            Regeneration still builds its own.

    Returns:
        A ``Response`` -- the chooser, or the edit form on a stale-data or

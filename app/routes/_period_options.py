"""The pay periods a row may be MOVED into, answered once for both forms.

Plan step **C2-f** (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_calendar.md``
section 4).  It replaces ``pay_period_service.get_current_and_future_periods``,
whose three call sites -- the transaction full-edit popover, the transfer
full-edit popover, and the transfer branch inside the transaction one -- each
rendered the same ``<select>`` from the same query.

**It is a FORM-OPTIONS rule and not a calendar question**, which is why it
lives here rather than as a fifth view on
:class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar`.  The calendar answers which
periods exist and when they run; "an already-closed period is not somewhere a
user moves an expense TO, except the one the row is in already" is a policy
about editing, and the row's own period is the caller's fact rather than the
schedule's.

**It TAKES the calendar rather than an owner id** (plan step `C4-a-5`), which
is what ``statement_match._candidates.destinations_for`` did one leaf earlier
under ruling **R-PC36**.  It derived its own until then, and that was fine
while a caller wanted nothing but the ``<option>`` list.

**ONE of the three call sites needs it, and the other two pay nothing**, which
is the honest form: an adversarial review of this step caught a first draft
claiming "the route holds a calendar either way" of all three.
``transactions/forms.get_full_edit``'s TRANSACTION branch binds the calendar
and asks it twice -- once for this list and once for the card's context line,
which names the row's own paycheck -- and deriving a second one there is the
shape of ledger row **P68**, CLOSED by plan step C2-f3c: one owner's calendar
derived twice in one render, with nothing holding the two answers equal.  Its
still-open sibling is **P69**.  *An adversarial review read the first draft's
bare "is ledger row P68" as a citation of a live row and reported the id as a
phantom; it is neither.  ``ledger.md`` carries OPEN findings only -- "a row
leaves when its fix SHIPS" -- so a closed row is absent from it BY DESIGN, and
seven other sites in ``app/`` cite P68 for this shape.  What the first draft
got wrong was the TENSE, not the id.*  The two TRANSFER branches
(``transactions/forms`` for a grid shadow cell, ``transfers/forms`` for the
transfers page) hold no calendar of their own and pass
``calendar_for(current_user.id)`` inline: for them this is the same single
derivation it always was, moved one frame up the stack and costing nothing
either way.

Deriving it is now the route's job, which is also where the refusal belongs: a
caller that cannot build a calendar has no form to render.

**The narrowing is a CONVENIENCE, not the guard**, and saying so is the honest
statement: the PATCH handlers re-resolve the submitted ``pay_period_id``
against the owner (``routes/transactions/_helpers`` and
``routes/transfers/mutations``) and accept any period that owner holds,
including a closed one.  What this list decides is what the browser OFFERS.

    """Return the periods a row currently in *current_period_id* may move to.

    Every SAVED period that has not yet ended, plus the row's own period even
    when it has.  Forcing the row's own period in is what keeps a transaction
    sitting in a past paycheck SELECTED in the dropdown instead of the browser
    defaulting to the first offered option and the save silently re-pointing
    the row at a paycheck the user never chose.

    **The day is the USER's** (:func:`~app.utils.dates.display_today`), where
    ``get_current_and_future_periods`` defaulted to ``date.today()``.

    **This moves nothing in the deployed container, and saying so is the
    point** (adversarial review of plan step C2-f1, which caught a first draft
    asserting a live production defect this repository refutes).  Both compose
    files pin ``TZ: America/New_York`` -- the 2026-06-12 dev/prod parity
    audit's finding **M01**, taken because the image default of UTC flipped
    ``date.today()`` to the next day at 20:00 Eastern and made exactly this
    dropdown drop the period the user was still in.  With the process clock
    pinned to the display zone the two agree, so the offer set is identical.

    What the change buys is that the rule no longer DEPENDS on that pin: all
    three call sites already compute ``display_today()`` two lines below for
    the settle-day input's ``max``, so one render held two clocks that are
    equal only by a deployment setting.  Reading the day the surface already
    uses removes the second clock rather than adding one, and it fixes the
    environments the pin does not cover -- CI, a script, a bare ``flask run``
    on a non-Eastern host.  The direction is also provably safe: Eastern is
    behind UTC, so where they do differ this offers one period MORE, never
    fewer.

    Args:
        calendar: The owner's :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar`,
            derived by the route from their COMPLETE payday set -- so a
            period's end here is the one every other surface reports.  Taken
            rather than derived: see the module docstring.
        current_period_id: The ``budget.pay_periods.id`` the row sits in
            today, forced into the result.  ``None`` for a caller with no such
            row, which then gets the not-yet-ended periods alone.

    Returns:
        The offerable periods, ``start_date`` ascending.  **A plain list and
        deliberately not a**
        :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PeriodWindow`: a row sitting well
        in the past puts its period in the result with every period between it
        and today left out, and a window is a CONTIGUOUS view that refuses
        exactly that shape.  Nothing here reports a balance across the gap --
        these are ``<option>`` rows -- so the hole is the right answer rather
        than a broken one.

    Raises:
        PayCalendarError: *calendar*'s saved periods do not cover an unbroken
            span (:meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.saved`).  **The
            SOURCE of this moved and the raise did not**, which is why the
            section survives the signature change: it used to name
            :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for`, called here, and
            an adversarial review of this step caught the block being deleted
            with that call while :meth:`~.PayCalendar.saved` below still
            raises.

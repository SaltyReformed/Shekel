"""
Shekel Budget App -- What the Reconcile page's REQUEST asked for

Three readers of the query string, one per argument the screen carries --
which TAB is open, whether the bound on the settled tabs is lifted, and which
card's MATCH pane renders in the document (plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-1``)
-- and, since plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-2a``, the reader of what the FORM
holds for one card's MATCH tab, and the ask the page is handed for the card it
opens.

**They are here because the page module is FULL**, and that is the honest
reason rather than a discovered cohesion: ``statement_reconcile`` stood at 993
of pylint's 1000-line ``max-module-lines`` before ``X-gi-1``, so the
correctness fix below could not be written where it belonged, and
``X-gi-2a``'s two readers pushed a first draft of it past the ceiling, which
is why they landed here instead.  The cohesion is real all the same -- every
function here answers *what did this request ask for*, before the door, and
every one of them is called by a ROUTE.

**THAT LAST WORD IS THE CORRECTNESS FIX** (adversarial review 2026-09-05).
:func:`asked_to_open` was read inside the page's context builder, which
:func:`~._statement_doors.run_statement_fragment_door` calls AFTER
``db.session.commit()`` -- so a POST carrying a malformed ``open`` applied a
money pass, committed it, and then answered a bare 404.  A reader of the
request runs before its door; putting all three in one module is what makes
that visible rather than remembered.

Services boundary: these are HTTP-shaped concerns.  What they import from the
service package is only the VALUES they hand back --
:class:`~app.services.statement_match.Tab`,
:class:`~app.services.statement_match.OpenedAsk`,
:class:`~app.services.statement_match.MatchSubmission` -- and the one schema
the form reader grades with.

def requested_tab() -> Tab:
    """Return which tab the request is about.

    **ONE reader for both methods**, over ``request.values``: the GET carries
    the tab as a query argument and the POST as a hidden field, and two
    readers would be two places for the answer to differ -- which is a page
    that applies a pass and answers with another tab.

    **Every tab the service builds is served, as of plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-1c``.**  This route carried a ``_TABS_SERVED`` tuple and
    404'd a tab outside it, because ``X-gj-1b`` shipped the three whose cards
    are bank lines and the two whose cards are ACTS were not built yet --
    offering one would have been a control that cannot succeed (**R-HW**).
    Both are built now, so the tuple guarded nothing and is DELETED rather than
    widened to hold every member of the enum: a subset constant equal to the
    whole set is a fence a reader has to check against the enum to trust.

        The :class:`~app.services.statement_match.Tab`, defaulting to the

    Plan steps ``bank_import:X-gj-1c`` and ``X-gj-4c-2``.  **The bound the
    register offered to lift, carried onto the tabs that replace it**
    (**R-HU**, **R-GX**): three tabs now render
    :data:`~app.services.statement_match.REGISTER_LIMIT` rows and say how many
    they withheld -- the two settled ones and the Skipped tab -- and this is
    what each of their *show the other N* links asks.  On the developer's own
    account it reaches 171 of 221 acts, so retiring the register without it
    would put them out of reach.

    A PRESENCE test and not a value one, exactly as the register's own reader

    spelling of it to parse and no value to refuse.  What a crafted request

    already renders.

    **Over ``request.args`` and not ``request.values``**, which is the register's
    own reader and is the narrower of the two.  Nothing submits this in a form
    BODY: the *show the other N* link carries it in a query string, and the
    Undo form carries it in its own ACTION's query string -- which is
    ``request.args`` on a POST as much as on a GET, and is why that form needs
    no hidden field at all.  Reading ``values`` would let a body flip the bound
    on a door, which is a widening nothing here asks for.  (:func:`requested_tab`
    does read ``values``, and must: the Apply form carries ``tab`` as a real
    hidden field.)

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-1``, ruling **bank_import:R-KA**.  The pane is
    a fragment htmx fetches when the tab is first shown, so with scripting off
    it never arrives at all and the card's ``<noscript>`` is what sends the
    owner here: the same page, the same tab, and ``?open=<line_id>``.

    **Over ``request.args``**, for the reason :func:`asked_for_everything`
    argues two functions above.  The Apply form carries it in its ACTION's
    query string, so a REFUSED press answers with the card's rows rather than
    the spinner -- and, since plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-2a``, with the
    owner's own ticks: the route reads what the body holds for this card

    press's ticks the same way, until ``bank_import:X-gi-2`` deleted that
    page and left this the only hand-build door there is.

    :func:`~._statement_doors.run_statement_fragment_door`
    calls that builder AFTER ``db.session.commit()``, so a POST whose ``open``
    was not an integer APPLIED THE PASS, COMMITTED IT, then answered a bare 404
    with no receipt and no way to know whether the money had moved.  *An
    earlier draft of this docstring cited ``_requested_tab`` as precedent for
    the opposite placement; that function is read per route.*

        a stale ``?open=`` is, and :func:`~app.services.statement_match

    **Read through** :func:`~app.utils.digit_strings.parse_row_id`, **the one
    spelling a row id has** (plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-2a``).  It was a
    bare ``int()`` until then -- which reads ``0``, ``-5``, ``007`` and
    ``+5`` as line ids, none of which names a row -- and that laxness became
    load-bearing the moment :func:`read_match` graded the same value as a
    ``line_ids`` member through :class:`~app.schemas.validation._helpers
    .RowId`: ``?open=0`` on Apply would have refused the WHOLE PASS at 400 in
    a sentence naming a field the body never carried, where the query string
    is this module's to answer and its answer is the 404 below.  Two readers
    of one value that disagree on ``"0"`` are the shape
    :mod:`app.utils.digit_strings` exists to delete, and

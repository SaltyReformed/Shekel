"""
Shekel Budget App -- Account Type CRUD Routes

Account-type CRUD for the per-user custom catalogue
(``ref.account_types``).  Split out of the historical monolithic
``app/routes/accounts.py`` in Commit 21 of the financial-calculation
audit follow-up (F-1); behaviour preserved verbatim from the
pre-split file.

The C-28 / F-044 multi-tenant ownership rule applies throughout:
seeded built-ins carry ``user_id IS NULL`` and are read-only to
every owner; custom rows carry the creating owner's ``user_id`` and
are invisible to other owners.  Cross-owner mutations collapse into
the same 404 response as a non-existent row, matching the project's
"404 for both 'not found' and 'not yours'" security rule.

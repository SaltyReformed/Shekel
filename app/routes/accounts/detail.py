"""
Shekel Budget App -- Per-Account Detail Pages

Detail / projection pages for cash and physical-asset accounts.  Split
out of the historical monolithic ``app/routes/accounts.py`` in Commit 21
of the financial-calculation audit follow-up (F-1); rebuilt for the
Fable 5 UI/UX overhaul (``docs/design/account_detail_audit.md``, "Rebuild
decisions").

The overhaul merged the former ``checking_detail`` and ``interest_detail``
pages into ONE :func:`cash_detail` page that serves EVERY cash account
kind: Checking, the ``has_interest`` types (HYSA / Money Market / CD /
HSA), and the previously page-less plain types (Savings, Credit Card, and
plain custom types).  Loans (``has_amortization``), physical assets
(``has_appreciation``), and retirement / investment accounts are NOT
served here -- they keep their own screens
(:func:`loan.dashboard`, :func:`property_detail`,
:func:`investment.dashboard`).  ``checking_detail`` and
``interest_detail`` survive only as thin redirect stubs to
:func:`cash_detail` so external bookmarks and the not-yet-updated cockpit
``detail_endpoint`` macro still resolve.

Balance production routes every figure through the balance-at seam
(Level-1 Commit 8).  The Fable 5 merge was a PRESENTATION rebuild and moved no
producer; plan step X-c2b2 then moved BOTH branches onto the cash fold, so what
the page shows changed there and not here:

* interest-bearing accounts via ``balance_at.interest_projection_for_account``,
  which returns the interest-accrued balances AND the per-period earned
  interest from ONE cash fold (plan step X-c2b2: the page read the
  kind-correct ``balance_map`` and the earned-interest accessor separately
  until the accrual's base became that fold, at which point the pair folded
  the same account TWICE per render -- finding N-64), and
* plain cash accounts via the cash-flow entry
  ``balance_at.cash_balance_map``.

Both seam entries delegate to the canonical entries-aware producers, so
the silent-degrade seam fixed by CRIT-01 / F-009 cannot reappear here.
The F-6 static guard in :mod:`tests.test_routes.test_accounts` pins this
contract by asserting that the seam (``balance_at.``) is used and that the
whole-account kind-correct ``balance_map`` is NOT called beside the interest
map; that guard reads this file directly.  Its third arm forbade the bare
entries-blind ``calculate_balances``, and plan step X-g4b deleted the arm with
the producer: a negative arm naming a function that no longer exists is a
sentence that can never fail.

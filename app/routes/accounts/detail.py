Shekel Budget App -- Per-Account Detail Pages

Detail / projection pages for cash and physical-asset accounts.  Split
out of the historical monolithic ``app/routes/accounts.py`` in Commit 21
of the financial-calculation audit follow-up (F-1); rebuilt for the
Fable 5 UI/UX overhaul (``docs/design/account_detail_audit.md``, "Rebuild
decisions").

The overhaul merged the former ``checking_detail`` and ``interest_detail``
pages into ONE :func:`cash_detail` page that serves EVERY cash account
kind: Checking, the ``has_interest`` types (HYSA / Money Market / CD /
HSA), and the previously page-less plain types (Savings, Credit Card, and
plain custom types).  Loans (``has_amortization``), physical assets
(``has_appreciation``), and retirement / investment accounts are NOT
served here -- they keep their own screens
(:func:`loan.dashboard`, :func:`property_detail`,
:func:`investment.dashboard`).  ``checking_detail`` and
``interest_detail`` survive only as thin redirect stubs to
:func:`cash_detail` so external bookmarks and the not-yet-updated cockpit
``detail_endpoint`` macro still resolve.

Balance production routes every figure through the balance-at seam
(Level-1 Commit 8).  The Fable 5 merge was a PRESENTATION rebuild and moved no
producer; plan step X-c2b2 then moved BOTH branches onto the cash fold, so what
the page shows changed there and not here:

* interest-bearing accounts via ``balance_at.interest_projection_for_account``,
  which returns the interest-accrued balances AND the per-period earned
  interest from ONE cash fold (plan step X-c2b2: the page read the
  kind-correct ``balance_map`` and the earned-interest accessor separately
  until the accrual's base became that fold, at which point the pair folded
  the same account TWICE per render -- finding N-64), and
* plain cash accounts via the cash-flow entry
  ``balance_at.cash_balance_map``.

Both seam entries delegate to the canonical entries-aware producers, so
the silent-degrade seam fixed by CRIT-01 / F-009 cannot reappear here.
The F-6 static guard in :mod:`tests.test_routes.test_accounts` pins this
contract by asserting that the seam (``balance_at.``) is used and that the
whole-account kind-correct ``balance_map`` is NOT called beside the interest
map; that guard reads this file directly.  Its third arm forbade the bare
entries-blind ``calculate_balances``, and plan step X-g4b deleted the arm with
the producer: a negative arm naming a function that no longer exists is a
sentence that can never fail.

    inside a read: it cost this page the one snapshot every figure on it is
    computed against, and it hid the door that should have written the row.
    The gap was real, and WIDER than the step's own first draft said: the

    an account interest-bearing** -- creating it, re-classing it

    So a missing row means the data was changed outside the application, and

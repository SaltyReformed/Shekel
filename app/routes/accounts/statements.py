"""
Shekel Budget App -- The statement import page, its write door and its undo

"What did my bank actually say?" -- the page that records a statement, the POST
that performs one, and the POST that takes one back.  Plan steps
**bank_import:X-f6a-1** and **X-f6a-4**, ruling **R-FP**.

**The undo is here because a refusal owes one** (finding **N-302**).  Recording
what a bank said is append-only by design -- an observation quietly rewritten is
what ruling **R-FL** exists to prevent -- and that left every refusal terminal:
a restated line, or a first import that named the wrong Shekel account, ended
that account's ability to import at all, while the message told the owner it
"needs a human before anything overwrites it", a promise nothing in ``app/``
could keep.  ``delete_statement_import`` is the human's hands.  It destroys what
the BANK said and moves no money: a settle day an accepted match wrote is the
app's own record and stays.

**It RECORDS, and since plan step ``bank_import:X-ge`` it also FILES what the
owner has already decided** (ruling **R-GH**).  Recording still moves no
figure: :func:`~app.services.statement_import.record_statement` writes
``budget.bank_statement_lines`` and stops.  What moves one is the second act in
the same request -- :func:`~app.services.statement_match.file_new_swipes` turns
each NEW swipe line whose merchant carries a standing rule into a purchase in
the destination that rule names, dated by the bank, receipted on this page with
the one-click undo ruling **R-GG** built.  **Consent for that was given when
the rule was stated**, which is R-GH's whole sentence; every act that would
MODIFY a row the owner made by hand -- re-date, re-price, settle, group-match
-- is still a proposal on the review screen (``X-f6a-2``) needing its tick.

**The page says which of the two it is doing**, and that is part of the design
rather than a caveat: it said "This records what your bank said. It changes no
balance." until this step, a sentence that would have become false the first
time a rule fired.

**Why it lives in the accounts package.**  A statement is a fact about ONE
account, the account is how ownership is checked, and the mapping from a bank's
account to a Shekel account is per-account state.  The subject boundary against
its siblings is the same one ``reconcile`` and ``difference`` cut along:
``anchor`` owns the balance ASSERTION's write door, ``reconcile`` owns what is
still OUTSTANDING against one, and this owns what the BANK said, which none of
them has ever had.

**It gates on the account KIND as well as on ownership**
(:func:`~app.routes.accounts._cash_page.load_cash_account_or_404`), because a
loan, a property or a 401(k) has no bank statement to import and its own detail
page 404s -- so without that gate this page renders for them with a back link
that dead-ends, and records bank lines against an account with no cash ledger.
The gate exists because the project has already paid twice for its absence.

Services boundary: this module owns the HTTP-shaped concerns -- ownership, the
upload, form parsing, flashes and redirects -- and delegates every read and
write to :mod:`app.services.statement_import`.

    **The evidence level cannot tell a guess from a proof, and reading it alone

    :attr:`~app.services.statement_import.ImportedBalance.day_is_solved` is the

    **What the ruling removed, and what it did not.**  It removed the warning
    that fired on the corroboration LEVEL, which SECU's dropped running-balance
    column had made the developer's permanent normal state -- the badge still
    reads ``uncorroborated`` and the sentence still says nothing has confirmed
    the figure.  It did not remove the warning on a guessed day, which is
    ACTIONABLE where the other was not: it clears by importing the span that is
    missing, and it does not depend on that column returning.  Measured on the

    2026-01-02 to 2026-08-21, so his next import's day is SOLVED and reports
    green.

    **The signal used to be ``opening_balance is None`` and that was measured
    WRONG too** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6e-1``).  That column was derived
    from the per-line running-balance chain, which SECU stopped exporting
    between the developer's 2026-07-19 and 2026-08-16 pulls -- so the warning

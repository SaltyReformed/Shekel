"""
Shekel Budget App -- Anchor Balance Edit Routes

The grid and Net Worth Cockpit anchor-balance true-up endpoints,
split out of the historical monolithic ``app/routes/accounts.py`` in
Commit 21 of the financial-calculation audit follow-up (F-1).  The
retired ``/accounts`` table's inline balance editor also lived here
until the Net Worth Cockpit replaced that table; the cockpit reuses
the grid editor below, so only that family remains.

``true_up`` routes the actual mutation, history-row append,
conditional entries reconcile, and commit through
:func:`app.services.anchor_service.apply_anchor_true_up`, so the duplicate rule
(ruling **R-EQ**: an assertion is refused only when it changes nothing) and the
concurrency contract live in exactly one place.  This module is
therefore deliberately thin: it owns the HTTP-shaped concerns (form
validation, HTMX-fragment rendering, HX-Trigger header composition)
and delegates the database mutation to the shared service.

**The C-17 / F-009 optimistic lock is no longer part of that contract**
(ruling R-EN, plan step X-f1c3c): a true-up UPDATEs no column on
``accounts``, so ``version_id`` cannot fire, and this module no longer
carries a pre-flush version check or a 409.  What serialises two
concurrent true-ups is the per-owner write lock the reconcile itself
takes (:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`) -- the reconcile is the
read-modify-write, so the lock belongs to it rather than to any one of
its callers.

The editor opens from five surfaces -- the grid cell, the dashboard
balance card, the cockpit per-card cell, the investment / retirement
detail page's balance hero, and the cash detail page's balance hero --
each threaded through as a normalized ``revert`` token so Cancel /
Escape AND a save re-render the correct opener, through the one table
:data:`_SURFACES` (rulings R-CC74 / R-CC77), and a save draws from what the
write door reports rather than re-reading the ledger (ruling R-CC79).

    **The reconcile prompt follows the COVERAGE BOUNDARY, not the click**
    (developer ruling 2026-08-04, plan step X-f1c4c).  Before this step every
    cash true-up stamped today, so "the day this submission asserts" and
    ``cash_ledger.reconciled_through`` -- ``MAX(observed_on)`` -- were the same
    value by construction and nothing had to say so.  A user-supplied day
    decouples them for the first time, and the prompt is keyed on the second.

    What that costs when nobody re-couples them, reproduced end to end: assert
    ``$2,500`` as of Jul 15 while the account's latest assertion is Aug 4, and
    the modal opens headed with the AUG 4 balance offering an Aug 2 purchase --
    which a Jul 15 statement cannot show.  Ticking it is a settlement the user
    has no evidence for, and it moves that debit out of its envelope's
    outstanding floor (``cash_ledger._amounts._entry_checking_impact``:
    ``max(500 - 0, 120) = 500`` becomes ``max(500 - 120, 0) = 380``), so the
    projected balance reads ``$120.00`` HIGH on money that never left the bank.

    **A ``None`` day is ALWAYS the boundary, and that is exact rather than a
    convenience.**  The service files ``display_today()`` for it, and every
    other assertion carries an ``observed_on`` at or before its own today
    (:func:`app.services.anchor_service.resolve_observation_day` refuses a
    future day), so today is ``>=`` every stored day and is therefore the new
    maximum.  For a supplied day *D* the new maximum is ``max(previous, D)``,
    so *D* is the boundary exactly when it equals it.  **The two branches are
    established differently and saying so matters**: the supplied-day branch
    COMPARES against the boundary, while the ``None`` branch is PROVED equal to
    it by the no-future-day rule and reads nothing.  An earlier version of this
    paragraph claimed both were read off one query, which is the over-stated
    shape this step corrected in three other docstrings.

    Asking here rather than sharpening the PANEL is the shape ruling R-EB and
    plan step X-f6 point at: the panel exists because nothing in the app records
    when money moved, and a bank import replaces the question rather than
    re-keying it.  Bounding the offer set by a historical statement day would
    manufacture hand-entered ``settled_on`` values for X-f6's matcher to
    arbitrate against the bank's own -- one question with two answers, which is
    what this arc exists to delete.

    Args:
        boundary_day: The account's coverage boundary AFTER the write --
            ``MAX(observed_on)`` over its owner-declared assertions, which is

    Shared by ``true_up``'s COMMITTED and UNCHANGED outcomes (both render the
    updated display cell and fire ``balanceChanged`` so other surfaces
    recompute).  Three fragments can ride along, and each is mounted where it
    can actually survive -- which is the whole of plan step X-f1e3:

    * **the display of the screen that opened the editor**, the response's
      primary target: that screen's own draw from :data:`_SURFACES`, the one
      its Cancel calls (rulings R-CC74 / R-CC77, finding CC-365) -- empty when
      that screen no longer shows the account (archived mid-edit), because
      the write has committed and a 404 would answer it as a failure;
    * **the reconcile prompt, the acknowledgement, or neither**, both
      out-of-band into a ``base.html`` mount that no refresh region owns, so
      both reach all five surfaces by construction;
    * **the ``#anchor-as-of`` caption, for the GRID alone**, because it is the
      only surface whose caption nothing else redraws (see
      ``grid/_anchor_as_of_oob.html`` for the per-surface measurement).

    **The prompt and the acknowledgement answer DIFFERENT questions, and
    welding them into one if/else is finding N-204** (plan step X-f2-b).  They
    were the two branches of :func:`_submission_is_the_coverage_boundary`,
    which is the right predicate for the PROMPT -- it is what makes the offered
    purchases the ones a statement for that day could actually settle -- and
    was never the right one for the acknowledgement.  Keying the second on the
    first's complement left a real write landing with NOTHING on screen:
    re-record the balance that already governs for a LATER day and a row is
    appended (the day differs), the coverage boundary moves, the cell
    re-renders to the same figure, and the prompt is ``""`` whenever nothing is
    outstanding.  Measured on production, that shape -- an equal balance
    re-asserted on a later day -- occurs once in the Checking account's 57
    assertions.

    So the acknowledgement now asks its own question: **did anything visible
    happen?**  It fires when the GOVERNING balance did not move and the prompt
    did not open.  The two stay mutually exclusive, but as a CONSEQUENCE of
    that second clause rather than as a construction -- and every state that
    acknowledged before still does, because a back-dated write cannot move the
    governing balance and so is a strict subset of the new condition.

    The comparison is on the BALANCE alone, deliberately, not on
    ``(balance, day)``.  Including the day would count the same-balance-later-day
    write as "something changed" because the ``as of`` caption moved -- and
    that is exactly the row N-204 is about.  A caption is also the wrong thing
    to rest on: it does not move at all for a back-dated write, so treating it
    as sufficient here and not there would be two rules for one question.

    **Both sides of that comparison are the write door's report, read under
    the owner's lock** (ruling **R-CC79**), and so is everything that decides
    between prompt and note: the coverage boundary is ``governing_after``'s
    day, and the prompt reconciles against ``governing_after`` itself.  Read
    here and in the route, outside the lock, two tabs saving at once could
    compare against a replaced figure and show the wrong one.

    **A BACK-DATED submission is acknowledged rather than rendered**, and the
    reason is that without it this response is indistinguishable from doing
    nothing.  The cell re-renders from the assertion that governs NOW -- the
    report's ``governing_after`` -- which a back-dated correction by definition
    does not change, so a user who recorded an older statement saw their
    editor collapse back to the same figure with no sign the write landed.
    That is the defect :func:`_anchor_editor_error` exists to prevent on the
    failure side, and it was still live on the success side.  It reached ONE of
    the five surfaces until plan step X-f1e3 gave it a mount of its own
    (finding **N-199**).

        account: The post-commit account.
        revert_context: The normalized surface token, or ``None`` -- which is
            the grid, the one surface the "as of" snippet is emitted for.  It
            picks the draw that answers.
        submission: What the form asserted.  Supplies both figures the
            acknowledgement names.  **Required, with no default**: a defaulted
            submission here means "suppress the safety check", and with one
            caller a default that can only ever be wrong is a footgun rather
            than a convenience.
        report: The write door's report.  A ``None`` ``governing_before``
            (no assertion at all) counts as "the balance moved", which is what
            a first assertion does.  ``governing_after`` dates the "as of"
            snippet by the ASSERTION's ``observed_on``, never the row's
            ``updated_at`` (ruling R-EP).  ``outcome`` decides the
            acknowledgement's COPY, not whether it fires: an R-EQ submission
            matching what governs writes nothing yet reaches it, so "Balance
            recorded" there would be false.

    ``display_today()`` rather than ``date.today()``: the
    process clock is pinned to the display zone in the deployed container but
    not in CI or a script, and an input must not offer a day the service then
    rejects (ruling R-DH (b)).

    The layering is deliberate, not redundant: an input bound is captured at
    RENDER time, and the floor moves when pay periods are generated or
    truncated, so a form left open across such a change can still submit a day

    return-statement ceiling; consolidating the gates into a
    ``(values, failure)`` helper mirrors ``_validate_update_account``'s
    established shape.  Gate order: kind refusal first (a loan is
    rejected before its form is even validated -- the KIND of edit is
    wrong, not the payload), then schema validation.

    **Two gates left at plan step X-f1c3c and neither was weakened.**  The
    C-17 stale-form check went with ruling R-EN: an assertion history is
    APPEND-ONLY, so a second tab overwrites no ASSERTION and there is no
    conflict to REPORT -- two assertions are two facts and the later-observed
    one is current.  What that check was incidentally serialising, the posting
    reconcile, is serialised explicitly now
    (:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`); a door-level gate was never the
    right home for it, since three other doors reach the same window.
    The "No current pay period found" 400 went with ruling R-EO:
    an assertion carries no pay period, so there is no period to resolve and
    nothing this door can fail to find.  That 400 was the true-up half of
    finding N-134's shape -- a balance the user typed, refused for want of a
    budgeting artifact that has nothing to do with what their bank holds.

    **BOTH arms answer a DESIGNED FRAGMENT.**  The schema arm converted at plan
    step X-f1c4c (it was ``jsonify(errors=...)``); the kind arm at X-f1e3, and
    the reason it had NOT converted was a measured-false claim this docstring
    used to make.  It said the editor is never OPENED for an amortizing account
    (``anchor_form`` refuses the same kind), so the arm answered a forged
    request and a designed fragment would be a rendering nobody could reach.
    **An account's kind is EDITABLE.**  ``_ACCOUNT_UPDATE_FIELDS`` includes
    ``account_type_id``, and ``_validate_account_type_change`` permits a
    boundary-crossing re-type while the account has no ledger postings -- which
    a ``$0.00`` opening leaves it with, because a zero correction emits no legs
    (``account_posting_service/_anchors.py``).  So: open the editor on such an
    account, re-type it to a mortgage in a second tab, press Save.  That is a
    real user in ordinary use, and ``base.html`` leaves 4xx non-swapping, so
    the raw body rendered NOTHING and the form simply sat there -- the exact
    defect X-f1c4c converted the other arm to prevent (finding **N-199**).
    It keeps the 422: the payload is well-formed and the ENTITY is what cannot
    be processed, and a designed fragment swaps on any status.

    It is the same open-then-change race ``_anchor_day_bounds`` already
    anticipates for the date floor, one field over: a form captured at render
    time can always be submitted after the state it was rendered against moved.

    # do nothing visible at all -- a dead click with no form to explain it,
    # which is finding N-199's defect in its worst form.

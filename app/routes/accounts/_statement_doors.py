"""One shape for every statement write door: act, commit, or say what stopped it.

The doors the statement pages own -- import a file, delete an import, accept a
match, apply a whole reviewed pass,
release one -- share their whole failure story and differ only in the act and
in what to say when it worked.  Writing that story per door is what pylint's
cross-file ``duplicate-code`` reported when the second one landed, and the
report was right: three copies of a rollback-and-flash are three places for a
refusal to stop being rendered.

**TWO ANSWER SHAPES, and the split is the answer rather than the story.**
:func:`run_statement_door` sets a flash and redirects;
:func:`run_statement_fragment_door` re-renders the surface, because a per-item
receipt overflows the 4 KB a browser stores for the signed session cookie a
flash rides in.  The second arrived at plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-3b``, when
the hand-build match form got a write door of its own and ``duplicate-code``
reported the second copy of the fragment story -- the same report, one shape
along.

**The story, once:**

* the act runs and the request commits, so the unit of work is the request and
  a refusal leaves nothing behind -- which is what makes "nothing was changed",
  the phrase every refusal message here ends with, true rather than reassuring;
* a DOMAIN refusal is the user's own sentence, flashed as it was written;
* a DATABASE error is not, so it goes to
  :func:`~app.routes._commit_helpers.handle_db_error`, which logs the detail
  and shows the user a sentence that does not name a table;
* success flashes what the door decided to say, AFTER the commit -- a business
  event or a message asserting that money moved must not appear when the
  transaction that would have moved it failed.

It lives in the accounts package rather than in ``_commit_helpers`` because the
refusal TYPE is a parameter here and that is a statement-door concern: the
import door refuses with ``StatementImportError`` and the match doors with
``ValidationError``, and generalising the helper any further would make it a
second spelling of ``try``.

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c-2`` extracted this, and the reason is the

    places for a refusal to stop being rendered.*  Two doors here name exactly
    one act and nothing else -- releasing a match
    (:func:`~._statement_release.release_and_return`) and undoing a skip
    (:func:`~.statement_reconcile.unskip_from_reconcile`) -- and they were
    STRUCTURALLY identical for eight lines, five of them byte-identical:
    build the payload, validate, flash the refusal and redirect, load the id,
    hand it to :func:`run_statement_door`.  The three that differed named the
    schema and the field.

    **Pylint's cross-file ``duplicate-code`` did NOT report it**, and that is
    why this is written down rather than left to the gate.  The longest
    byte-identical run was FOUR lines (``return run_statement_door(`` through
    ``refusal=ValidationError,``), and the checker requires more than its
    ``min-similarity-lines`` to fire -- so at the default of 4 a four-line run
    is silent, and it takes 5 to report.  *An earlier version of this
    paragraph said "byte-identical for seven lines" and "three consecutive
    lines against a minimum of four"; both were measured false, and the second
    would have taught a reader that four identical lines ARE caught.*  A gate
    is a floor.  Named by adversarial review 2026-09-04.

    **It is the VALIDATE half only, and the two acts stay separate.**  What
    the doors share is the shape of grading a one-id form; what they do not
    share is the act, the receipt or the refusal story, which is why undoing a
    skip does not go through ``release_and_return``.  Folding those would be a

    **Why the two cannot be one.**  A redirect door sets a flash and sends the
    browser somewhere; these re-render the whole surface, because the ruled
    failure policy is that a refused item leaves nothing behind while the rest
    still land, each refusal quoted -- and flash messages ride in the signed
    session cookie, where the longest sentence a batch item can carry measures
    497 bytes against the 4 KB a browser will store.  Nine of those overflow
    it, and an overflowed cookie is dropped, which logs the owner out.  A
    single helper carrying both shapes would have to branch on which kind of
    door called it, which is the caller-sniffing this package refuses.

    **It owns the ANSWER as well as the failure**, unlike its sibling, and that
    is what makes the fresh-scope-on-success rule structural: a door cannot
    accidentally report a pass against the state that pass replaced, because it
    no longer chooses which scope to render from.

    Stated ONCE for both doors that apply a
    :class:`~app.services.statement_match.BatchOutcome` -- the reviewed pass
    and the hand-built match -- because they write the same event about the
    same value and a second copy of the list is a second place to forget a
    field.  **Two were forgotten once already**: ``repriced_count`` and
    ``residual_count`` were missing from the pass event from the day it was
    written, and they are the two that move MONEY rather than dates.  Named by
    adversarial financial review 2026-08-23.

    **Every count, including the ones a given door cannot produce.**  A
    hand-built match carries no creation and no income, so ``recorded_count``,
    ``refunded_count``, ``envelopes_created`` and ``deposited_count`` are
    structurally zero there
    -- and they are still emitted, because an audit trail whose FIELDS depend
    on which door wrote the row cannot be queried across the two.

    **A LIST field's errors are keyed by INDEX, not flat**, so
    ``{"matches": {0: {"line_ids": {0: ["Not a valid id."]}}}}`` is the
    ordinary shape here rather than an exotic one -- and a flattener assuming
    ``{field: [str]}`` raises ``TypeError`` inside the handler that exists to
    render a refusal.  It is also why ``error_fragments.flatten_schema_errors``
    is not used: that helper's own contract is the flat shape, and one reviewed
    pass nests three levels deep.

    **The PATH travels with the message, and dropping it was a real cost at
    this volume.**  Marshmallow reports one entry per bad value, so a stale
    page with forty unparseable ids rendered ``Not a valid id.; Not a valid
    id.; ...`` forty times -- no item named, no remedy, and nothing the owner
    could act on.  Named by adversarial design review 2026-08-19.

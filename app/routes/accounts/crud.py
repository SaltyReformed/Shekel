"""
Shekel Budget App -- Account CRUD Routes

Account create / read / update / archive / hard-delete endpoints.
Split out of the historical monolithic ``app/routes/accounts.py``
in Commit 21 of the financial-calculation audit follow-up (F-1);
behaviour preserved verbatim from the pre-split file.

The optimistic-lock contract (commit C-17 / F-009) operates at two
tiers in this module's update / archive / hard-delete routes: a
pre-flush ``version_id`` comparison against the form value (catches
the sequential Tab-1 / Tab-2 race) and the SQLAlchemy
``version_id_col`` ``WHERE version_id = ?`` at flush time (catches
the truly-concurrent interleaving the form-side check cannot see).
Both layers convert ``StaleDataError`` into a flash + redirect so
the user can retry against fresh row state.

The C-28 / F-044 multi-tenant ownership guard for
``ref.account_types`` lives in :mod:`app.utils.account_validation`
(``_account_type_is_visible``, ``_visible_account_types``); routes
in this file call those helpers rather than inlining the guard.

    it, which made this the app's SECOND balance-assertion door -- and the two
    doors answered the same submission differently.  This form PRE-FILLS the
    current figure, so saving a rename re-submitted it unchanged; this door read
    that as "no change" while the write door (:func:`stage_anchor_true_up`, and
    ruling R-EQ) reads a submission as new when it changes what GOVERNS, which
    includes the day.  Two neutral reviews of plan step X-f1c4b recommended
    aligning this door's gate with that rule; both missed that the pre-fill makes
    it worse, because a rename would then silently assert today's balance and
    absorb purchases the user never reconciled.  The gate was the right rule for
    a form that is not a balance-reading surface -- so the SURFACE went, not the
    gate.  Asserting a balance is the one-click editor's job
    (``accounts.true_up``), on every screen that shows a balance.

    Optimistic locking (commit C-17 / F-009) operates in two layers:

      1. Stale-form check: the edit form ships ``version_id`` as a
         hidden input set to the row's counter at render time.  When
         the submitted value differs from the current
         ``Account.version_id``, the handler short-circuits with a
         flash + redirect (renders well in a non-HTMX flow) and
         records nothing.  This catches the sequential Tab-1/Tab-2
         race documented in the C-17 manual verification.

      2. SQLAlchemy ``version_id_col``: any concurrent flush that
         races past the stale-form check is still narrowed by
         ``WHERE version_id = ?`` at the database tier; the loser
         raises ``StaleDataError`` which the handler converts into
         the same flash + redirect path.  The two layers together
         close every interleaving the optimistic-lock contract is
         meant to cover.

    # known to take a ``budget.accounts`` row lock, so naming one here would be
    # a claim nobody has tested") was FALSE, and plan step X-f1e2's concurrency

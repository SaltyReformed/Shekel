Shekel Budget App -- Loan route package: payoff + refinance calculators.

The HTMX what-if calculators: the payoff calculator (extra-payment and
target-date modes) and the refinance comparison.  Both load the shared loan
context so their "current" baseline matches the dashboard's loan card, and
both render result partials.  The payoff lever's preview line and its
savings read the balance seam's plan fold through the same helpers the
dashboard's band chart reads (plan step R7d-g-3, ruling **R-R88**), so the
preview cannot diverge from the chart it overlays.

    The "current" baseline is deliberately contractual
    (``scenarios.original_forward``), NOT the plan-aware committed schedule the
    resolver seam now produces (step 8, Sec. 16): a refinance is a like-for-like
    minimum-vs-minimum comparison, since any standing extra could be paid on
    either loan.  See :func:`_build_refinance_comparison`.

    The refinance principal defaults to the current real balance +
    closing_costs.  The user may override for cash-out refinances.

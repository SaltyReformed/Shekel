"""
Shekel Budget App -- Loan route package: recurring payment transfers.

Creates a recurring monthly transfer (RecurrenceRule + TransferTemplate +
generated Transfer records with shadow transactions) from a source account to
the debt account.  The amount defaults to the resolver-derived monthly payment
(P&I + escrow) with live derivation, or a user-supplied override.

**The two settings doors are PER DEFINITION since plan step R7d-g-3** (ruling
**R-R83**): a loan can have any number of recurring transfers paying into it,
each with its own ``loan_payment_settings`` row, and the dashboard's payment
card offers the extra-principal and track-the-contract controls on every one.
Each door therefore names the TEMPLATE it writes in its URL and admits it only
through :func:`_require_loan_payment_definition` -- the template must be one
of the loan's own active recurring transfers, else 404.  Until that step both
doors took the loan alone and wrote whichever definition
``active_recurring_transfer_template`` picked (the oldest), which handed the
Track door a ``$50`` sweep created before the real payment and flipped THAT
to derive (plan ledger row **D49**).

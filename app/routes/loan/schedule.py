Shekel Budget App -- Loan route package: standalone amortization schedule.

The full month-by-month amortization schedule, demoted off the loan detail page
(the Loop B rebuild: the schedule is a statement table the developer reaches
occasionally, not the page's centre of gravity) into its own route linked from
the detail page's footer.  Renders the same planned trajectory the loan card
carries -- confirmed actuals from the genesis ledger plus the plan-aware
projected payments (the committed trajectory reflecting recurring payments and
any standing extra since the step-8 seam fix) -- so the table cannot diverge
from the card.

    """Standalone month-by-month amortization schedule for a loan.

    A schedule TABLE, not a balance surface, so it does not read the balance
    seam: it composes its planned trajectory ONCE off the same load-and-compose
    the detail page's band chart shares (:func:`._helpers.load_baseline_scenarios`,
    ``history_rows + committed_forward``) with the loan's standing extra -- the
    identical committed trajectory the card carries -- so the schedule is
    derived exactly once.  Guards via :func:`._require_configured_loan`:
    a cross-owner / non-loan account 404s, an un-configured loan redirects to its
    detail page (the setup surface).

    **It reads no clock, and plan step X-au-g-2b is what removed the two reads
    it had** (ruling **R-IJ**).  It resolved
    ``current_rate_baseline(..., date.today())`` for the ARM rate column's
    per-row fallback -- a branch no rendered row could reach, since every
    ``AmortizationRow`` carries its period's rate -- and passed
    ``loan.monthly_escrow``, one escrow resolved at ``date.today()``, for every
    row of a 360-month table (finding **N-410**).  Both are the builder's
    business now, and the builder resolves each row on the installment it
    renders: the loan's escrow LINES go in, not one figure off them.

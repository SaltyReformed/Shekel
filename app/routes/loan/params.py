         have access to the loan's origination date; folding the
         check into the schema would require coupling
         :class:`LoanParams` into the schemas module.  A

    """Set or clear the asset that secures this loan (home-equity link).

    Writes the nullable ``collateral_account_id`` self-link on the loan
    account so a mortgage / HELOC can be grouped with the Property it is
    secured by and equity rendered.  The link is presentation only -- the
    emergent net-worth math never reads it.

    **Exactly ``""`` clears the link; anything else -- including the field
    being ABSENT -- is refused** (plan step X-ae).  Those are different inputs
    and this route used to answer them all the same way: ``""`` is the picker's
    own blank option, a deliberate "nothing secures this loan", while any other
    value, or no field at all, cannot come from the picker.  A browser
    rendering this form always submits the ``<select>``, so an absent field is
    a forged or truncated POST, not a choice.  Clearing on the second meant a
    forged field silently destroyed a real link under a success flash -- and,
    on 128 of the characters ``str.isdigit()`` accepts, raised into an
    unhandled 500 before it got that far (finding N-136).  A value that names
    no id now gets the same
    :data:`~app.utils.account_validation.INVALID_COLLATERAL_LINK` answer as an
    id naming no account, and nothing is written.

    **The submission is NOT stripped, and that is the ruling rather than an
    omission.**  A ``.strip()`` here re-opened the hole twice over: it maps
    every Unicode space to ``""`` -- ``"\\xa0".strip()`` is ``""`` -- so a
    forged non-breaking space took the CLEAR path under a success flash, the
    exact behaviour the paragraph above says is closed; and it normalised a
    value before applying the shared rule, so ``" 2 "`` linked here while the
    reconcile and companion doors refused it, leaving four doors with three
    behaviours.  Both were found by adversarial review of the first build.

    Every value that DOES name an id is validated by
    :func:`app.utils.account_validation._validate_collateral_link`
    (same-owner Asset target, no self-link, source is an amortizing
    liability) before it is written.

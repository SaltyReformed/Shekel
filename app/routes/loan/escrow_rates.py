Shekel Budget App -- Loan route package: escrow + rate-history management.

The HTMX partial routes that add a rate-history entry and add / remove escrow
lines.  Both escrow routes rebuild the escrow list through the shared
:func:`_render_escrow_list` tail (resolve today's active lines, recompute monthly
escrow + total payment, emit the OOB payment-summary swap), so that parallel
render lives in exactly one place.

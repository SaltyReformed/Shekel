    """The direction-D retirement readiness page.

    Derives the retirement picture ONCE and shapes the readiness picture
    from it (:func:`~app.services.retirement_readiness.readiness_from_picture`);
    the levers run on the same loaded inputs and the same memoized picture.
    The context carries exactly what the rebuilt template consumes: the
    readiness dict, the lever baselines, the per-account projections +
    salary profiles for the accounts table, the blended return for the
    what-if-only assumed-return row, and the settings row the included
    assumptions rail echoes its stored values from (P4 live-verify
    defect: the P3c slim dropped ``settings``, so every rail input
    rendered its empty/fallback state, the stored SWR invisible).  The rail
    also reads the owner's active salary profiles, whose recurring raises it
    states the end year of (plan step salary:S3-c).  The legacy gap-table
    context (gap analysis, chart data, SWR slider default) retired with
    the old page (P3c).

    **This route opens the render's ONE read pass and LOADS its inputs once**
    (plan steps C2-f2d-1 and C2-f2d-2, ledger rows **P43** and **P57**).  The
    readiness verdict and the lever card are two views of ONE retirement
    picture: they belong to one owner, one baseline scenario, one day and one
    plan.  Each used to build its own pass AND its own loaded inputs AND its
    own derivation of that picture -- 86 of the render's 179 queries on a
    production clone were the second copy, and the lever card's month-0 probe
    recomputed the verdict the hero had already drawn.

    **What that buys, stated exactly.**  ``picture_at(inputs, STORED_PLAN)``
    below and the lever solver's own month-0 probe are the SAME object, not two
    equal ones, so the two cards cannot state different figures for one plan.
    **And this render is single-clock as of pay-calendar plan step C2-f2e**,
    which closed ledger row **P55**: ``compute_pension_summary``,
    ``compute_gap_net_biweekly`` and ``build_employer_salary_basis`` (deleted
    at plan step salary:S3-e-2) each took ``date.today().year`` for
    themselves, once per plan point over about ten probes, so a render
    crossing a NEW YEAR could project the verdict card's salary path from
    year N and the lever card's from N+1.  Both survivors take the pass's day
    now.  The gates are
    ``tests/test_arch/test_one_read_pass_per_render.py`` for the pass and
    ``test_retirement_dashboard_service.TestTheRenderDayOpensTheSalaryPath``
    for the day.

    ``_assumptions.html`` stub with field errors and the echoed input at
    422 (fragment-friendly for both HTMX and plain posts); success
    renders the refreshed panel for an HTMX request and falls back to a

    otherwise the settings save applies unchanged.  Writes go through the
    ORM so the audited-table triggers capture them.

    **Raise end-year write-through** (plan step salary:S3-f-3, ruling
    **R-SAL22**), the second such arm: a recurring-raise row's Save posts
    the same ``raise_end_mode_<id>`` / ``raise_end_year_<id>`` pair its
    what-if sends, the schema gathers it as the readiness query does, and
    :func:`_resolve_end_year_saves` grades it against the ROW -- 404 for an
    id the rail does not list, a designed 422 with the message on that row's
    control for an answer the ONE end-year rule refuses.  The write is the
    column on ``salary.salary_raises`` (audit triggers, the row's optimistic
    lock), and it is followed by what EVERY raise write is followed by:
    :func:`~app.services.salary_regeneration.regenerate_salary_transactions`
    on the raise's profile (ruling **R-SAL24** put that walk below both
    routes), so the template's per-paycheck amount and the row set the
    salary page would leave behind are the ones this door leaves behind.
    A stale race in that write -- the raise, its template or its rows
    changed under the request -- rolls back and re-renders the rail FRESH
    with the conflict on the row at 409, the designed-conflict shape every
    fragment route answers with; nothing else in this route carries a
    version counter, so a :class:`StaleDataError` here is that write's.  Any
    other DB-tier failure of the same write rolls back and answers a designed
    500 on the row, the fragment-shaped twin of the salary package's
    ``handle_db_error`` arm.  **The rail row carries NO version counter**
    (developer ruling 2026-09-12): a one-column Save from a rail rendered
    before the same raise was edited elsewhere is last-write-wins on that
    column -- the owner typed the year while looking at the row, and the rail
    re-renders fresh after every Save -- where the salary form's whole-payload
    submit refuses the race with a version pre-check; the flush-time lock

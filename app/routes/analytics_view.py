"""
Shekel Budget App -- Analytics View-Model Builders

The route-layer presentation helpers for the analytics blueprint,
separated from :mod:`app.routes.analytics` so that module holds the HTTP
handlers (request parsing, auth, redirects, ``render_template``) and this
one holds the pure "turn a service report into template-ready data" logic
(Single Responsibility; it also keeps the handler module under the
1000-line ceiling as the page grows one slice at a time).

Every function here is pure: it takes a service report (or plain scalars)
and returns dicts / JSON strings / SVG point strings, with NO Flask
request context, NO database access, and NO models.  This is the one layer
where ``float`` is allowed -- at the Chart.js / SVG serialization boundary
(coding-standards: floats live only here, never in a money calculation);
the money values themselves are computed as ``Decimal`` in the services.

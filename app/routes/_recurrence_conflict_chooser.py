"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurring-definition regeneration and its conflict chooser
(Loop B, P3)

The second half of a template edit.  :mod:`app.routes._recurrence_form_helpers`
resolves what the template's recurrence now IS; this module re-drives the rows
that recurrence already generated, and mediates the one case where doing so
would overwrite something the user changed by hand.

The flow, shared verbatim by the transaction-template and transfer-template
update routes (each supplying its own :class:`RecurrenceConflictKind`):

* :func:`regenerate_or_conflict_chooser` -- the entry point.  Regenerates the
  non-overridden future instances, and on a collision decides between applying
  the user's chooser decisions, rendering the chooser, or committing silently.
* :func:`render_recurrence_conflict_chooser` -- renders the full-page chooser,
  echoing the submitted edit as hidden inputs so Apply re-runs it.
* :func:`parse_conflict_decisions` / :func:`apply_conflict_decisions` -- read
  the chooser's per-instance keep/use decisions back and act on them.

Split out of ``_recurrence_form_helpers`` when that module reached the
1,000-line cap (plan step R2e-1).  The seam is the one that module's own
docstring already drew: resolving a rule from a form payload and regenerating a
template's instances are different jobs with different collaborators, sharing
only the two routes that call both.

Route-layer module (leading underscore = route-internal) rather than a service
because it consumes Flask ``flash`` / ``render_template`` / ``request`` /
``url_for``; ``CLAUDE.md::Architecture`` keeps services isolated from Flask
globals.

    Transaction or Transfer).
    Rows are returned chronologically (undated last) so the chooser reads
    top-to-bottom in time order.  A vanished id (deleted between the raise
    and this load) is skipped.

    **The "Keep $X" figure is RESOLVED, not read off the amount column** (plan
    step X-au-c2b, added when an adversarial review found this reader).  It read
    ``getattr(row, amount_attr)`` -- the very column a derived row does not
    carry -- and rendered it through ``money()`` on a live screen, so the

    transaction, :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_transfer_amount` for a
    transfer), which is why ``amount_attr`` is gone: the column NAME was only
    ever a way to spell "ask this kind what it is worth", and the amount model
    answers that question per kind already.

    merely unused.

    ``overridden_ids`` and ``deleted_ids`` are appended in ONE place --

    ``_recurrence_common.rows_this_pass_may_maintain``
    (``recurrence_engine._maintain:167``, ``transfer_recurrence:455``), which
    filters ``pay_period_id`` to ``[p.period_id for p in
    schedule.calendar.saved()]``.  *calendar* below is that same calendar off
    the same read pass, so a conflicted row naming a period it does not hold is
    unconstructible: the precondition is carried by the QUERY, which is what
    ``require_period``'s own docstring says makes a total form honest.  The
    raising twin is still what this call site owes -- the id is read off a
    STORED row -- and it is what a future caller assembling the id set some
    other way would run into.

    **It also takes the KIND rather than two of its fields**, which is one

        **R-JD**).
      * First submit of an amount-changing edit (``amount_drives_instances``,
        the template STILL recurs, and ``default_amount`` differs from
        ``before.amount``): render the chooser, ROLL BACK the pending edit
        (nothing is persisted), and return the chooser
        :class:`~flask.Response` for the caller to return.
      * Any other conflicting edit -- a rename / rule / flag change, or a
        salary-linked template whose ``default_amount`` does not drive its
        instance amounts -- leaves the overrides as the regeneration
        preserved them and returns ``None`` so the caller commits.  This
        keep-silently branch is deliberate: nothing the user can see changed
        for those instances, so no prompt and no flash (the service still
        logs the override / delete counts for forensics).

    **A CLEARED recurrence regenerates too**, and the guard that skipped it
    was the second half of a live defect (see
    :func:`resolve_recurrence_rule_for_update` for the first).  The gate used
    to be "the template has a rule NOW"; a user who set the pattern to
    "Does not repeat" therefore left every future instance the deleted rule
    had already generated sitting on the grid.  The gate is now "the template
    IS or WAS recurring", and on a cleared recurrence the regeneration deletes
    the untouched projected rows from ``effective_from`` forward and generates
    nothing, because there is no rule left to generate from.  Settled rows are
    immutable and overridden ones raise as conflicts exactly as they do for
    any other edit (``_recurrence_common.classify_maintain_work``), and since
    plan steps R10-a and R10-b a row carrying the owner's own records is
    RETAINED rather than removed -- so clearing a recurrence destroys neither
    history, nor a deliberate per-instance change, nor anything the owner
    recorded against a row.

    A template that neither has nor had a rule is still skipped, and the
    distinction is load-bearing: a RULE-LESS transfer template's single
    Transfer is an ordinary auto-generated row, so a rename would otherwise
    sweep it away.  **That gate is what closes defect D16.**  A transfer that
    does not repeat used to carry a ``Once`` RULE, so it reached the
    regeneration below: the sweep hard-deleted the row and the pattern's own
    suppression guard generated nothing back.  Measured on a rename, with the
    transfer in a future period: 1 transfer + 2 shadows -> 0 + 0.  Plan step
    R2e-3 retired the pattern, so such a template is rule-less and this gate
    covers it.

    **The chooser additionally requires that the template STILL recurs.**  It
    asks one question -- "should your hand-edited instances move to the new
    amount?" -- and that question presumes future instances will be
    regenerated AT that amount.  On a cleared recurrence none will be, so the
    prompt would offer an amount decision about rows that are being deleted:
    measured before this guard, a clear-plus-amount edit rendered "Your other
    upcoming instances move to $99.99" over five rows the same request then
    removed.  Without the prompt the edit takes the keep-silently branch, so
    the hand-edited rows survive untouched -- the conservative answer, and the
    one the user can still revise on the grid.

    **The sweep is BASELINE-SCOPED.**  Only the baseline scenario is
    regenerated (as for every other edit), so rows this template generated
    into a non-baseline scenario are left in place -- and once the rule is
    deleted no later edit can reach them, because there is no recurrence left
    to clear a second time.

    Args:
        template: The edited template (its field updates already applied).
        before: The template's pre-edit state
            (:class:`PreEditTemplateState`) -- its amount and whether it
            named a recurrence rule.  Both are already overwritten on
            *template* by the time this runs.
        effective_from: The edit's effective date.
        kind: The per-kind config (:class:`RecurrenceConflictKind`).
        amount_drives_instances: Whether ``default_amount`` actually drives
            this template's generated instance amounts.  ``False`` for a
            salary-linked template (paycheck-calculated per period), which
            suppresses the chooser so a vestigial ``default_amount`` edit
            never mis-states a paycheck.  Transfers always pass ``True``.

    Returns:
        The chooser response to short-circuit to, or ``None`` to proceed to
        commit (no scenario, a template that neither has nor had a recurrence
        rule, no conflict, a non-amount edit, an edit that cleared the
        recurrence, or a conflict already resolved from Apply).

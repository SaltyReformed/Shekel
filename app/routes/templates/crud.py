"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurring route package: recurring-transaction CRUD.

Create, edit, update, archive, unarchive and hard-delete a recurring
TRANSACTION definition (a :class:`~app.models.transaction_template.TransactionTemplate`)
and the recurrence rule it carries, plus the kind-agnostic recurrence-preview
fragment endpoint both template forms point at.  Updating a template triggers
recurrence regeneration.

The unified Recurring LIST page is the sibling module
:mod:`app.routes.templates.surface`: it spans both template kinds, so it is not
part of this one.

         standing merchant rule files a merchant's bank spending into it
         (``archive_helpers.template_has_standing_rule``, plan step
         ``bank_import:X-gd-2``), permanent deletion is blocked.  The template
         is archived instead (if not already) and the user is warned, with the
         sentence naming which of the two reasons applied.
      2. If no settled history exists, all linked NON-SETTLED transactions
         are deleted first, then the template itself is permanently
         removed -- ``definition_delete.permanently_delete_definition``, the
         one act, shared with the account hard-delete since plan step
         ``balance:X-bi-7a``.  ``Transaction.template_id`` is a FK with ON
         DELETE RESTRICT (plan step ``balance:X-bi-7d-2``; SET NULL before
         it), so any row that survived the filtered delete would refuse the

         NULL link; guard 1 is what makes that set empty (ruling **R-JE**),
         so the refusal is a designed 4xx rather than the database's.

    Defense in depth (CRIT-05 / E-22): the bulk delete is constrained to
    non-settled rows via the semantic ``Status.is_settled`` boolean.
    Even if the guard predicate above regresses, is bypassed, or races a
    concurrent mark-done that lands between the guard check and the
    delete, settled financial history (Paid, Received) cannot
    be physically destroyed by this route.  The pre-fix code enumerated
    ``[DONE, SETTLED]`` and silently omitted RECEIVED, then bulk-deleted
    unconditionally -- the irreversible data-loss path CRIT-05 documents.

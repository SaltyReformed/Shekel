"""
Shekel Budget App -- Template routes: what a submitted template form may SAY.

:func:`validate_template_form` -- the refusals both the create and the update
route apply before anything is written -- and the per-question predicates behind
it.

**It is a module of its own since plan step balance:X-au-d**, which added the
salary-type refusal and took ``crud.py`` past pylint's 1,000-line ceiling
(ruling **R-IR**: the session that breaks a module splits it).  The cut is a
SUBJECT rather than a size: everything here answers *may this form say this*,
and reads nothing about what a write then does.  ``crud.py`` keeps the routes
and the writes.

Boundary discipline: these are ROUTE-tier checks, so they read ``current_user``
and return flash text.  They issue queries and no writes.

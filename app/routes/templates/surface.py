"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurring route package: the unified Recurring surface.

The ``/templates`` page itself: every active recurring definition a user has --
income, expense AND transfer templates -- in one list, plus the page-wide
Monthly / Per-paycheck unit toggle and the collapsed Archived drawer.  It reads
BOTH template kinds and shapes them through one producer
(:mod:`app.services.recurring_view`), which is why it is not part of the
recurring-TRANSACTION CRUD module beside it.

The loaders here are the surface's own inputs: the producer takes plain data
(its docstring states that contract), so the queries that feed it live at the
route boundary rather than inside it.

Shekel Budget App -- Root-Scope Static Passthrough and Asset Versioning

Serves a small number of static files at the application root
rather than under ``/static/``, and owns the static-asset
content-hash helpers used for cache busting: the service worker's
cache name (:func:`_static_asset_version`, a hash over every cached
asset) and the per-file ``v=`` URL parameter
(:func:`static_file_version`, appended to every
``url_for('static', ...)`` URL by ``_register_static_versioning``
in ``app/__init__.py``).

Two root-scope entries are served here.  ``/sw.js`` -- the browser
scopes a service worker to the directory its file is served from, so
a worker at ``/static/sw.js`` would only see ``/static/...`` requests
and could not intercept app-route fetches.  Hosting the worker at
``/sw.js`` widens the scope to ``/`` so the static-asset cache also
covers requests issued from any page in the app.  ``/manifest.json``
-- the PWA manifest, rendered rather than served static so its icon
``src`` URLs carry the same content-hash ``?v=`` parameter every
other static asset URL gets (see :func:`web_manifest`); a plain
string inside the static JSON is invisible to the versioning hook.

The route is exempt from Flask-Limiter for the same reason
``/health`` is: the browser may request ``/sw.js`` on every page
load to check for an updated worker (per the SW HTTP cache rules),
and rate-limiting that path would surface as silent SW staleness.
The file the route serves contains no user data, so the rate-limit
budget gains nothing from defending it.

The served worker's cache name is versioned by content: the
``__ASSET_VERSION__`` placeholder in ``sw.js`` is replaced at serve
time with a short hash of every cached static asset (see
:func:`_static_asset_version`).  The hash changes whenever any of
those assets changes, which changes the worker bytes the browser
sees and makes the worker's ``activate`` handler evict the prior
cache, so returning users pick up changed CSS/JS without a manual
cache-name bump.

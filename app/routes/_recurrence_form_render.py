"""
Shekel Budget App -- What an EDIT form's recurrence controls START ON

The render-side half of :mod:`app.routes._recurrence_form_helpers`, split out
at plan step R7b-4 when that module reached the 1,000-line cap for the second
time -- the same trigger that produced
:mod:`app.routes._recurrence_conflict_chooser` at plan step R2e-1, and the same
kind of seam: everything here answers a read-only question ABOUT a stored
definition, everything there acts on a SUBMITTED payload.

Two entry points, one per kind of form.  :func:`create_form_recurrence_state`
is the state a form for a definition that does not exist yet opens on, and
:func:`edit_form_recurrence_state` composes, for a stored definition, the
three questions the two template forms render a control for:

* :func:`edit_form_cadence` -- which ``(unit, interval, placement)`` triple the
  three cadence controls preselect, or ``None`` (with a flashed explanation)
  when the stored pattern is one this application no longer models;
* :func:`edit_form_starts_on` -- what the "Starts on" row holds: the date, the
  day it means on the one date shape that leaves it open, and whether the row
  is LOCKED because the app writes that bound;
* :func:`edit_form_end` -- what the "Ends" row holds: which of the control's
  three shapes is selected and its value when the bound is the owner's, and
  the described stop the row DISPLAYS when it is locked because the app
  derives it.

**Each bound's row carries its own lock, since plan step R7d-f.**  Both rows
lock on ONE identity -- the definition is the standing payment of the loan it
pays into (:func:`~app.services.loan_recurrence_sync.is_standing_loan_payment`)
-- but what the lock MEANS differs per bound, and a single ``bounds_are_derived``
flag said "the app writes both", a premise ruling **R-R29** made false.  The
opening bound IS written: ``starts_on`` is the loan's first contractual
installment and the sync re-writes it.  The closing bound is DERIVED: the
loan's payoff is resolved through the composed door on every read, the column
that used to be shown here is the chokepoints' cache of it (plan ledger row
**D35** measures that cache stale), and the loan's own payment has no authored
stop -- archiving is the door to stop it early (ruling **R-R59**, developer
2026-09-05).  So the locked "Ends" row renders the door's answer, worded by
the same describer the Recurring row uses (ruling **R-R58**), and never the
column.

**The form takes the READ PASS** (:class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`)
for that reason: the derived stop is a fold over the loan in the owner's
baseline scenario, and the identity is read off the pass's memoised loan
resolution rather than re-queried (plan ledger row **N-511**).  A route builds
the pass and hands it down (the 2026-08-16 ruling).  An owner with no baseline
scenario is REFUSED the loan payment's form through the seam's own guard --
``BaselineMissingError`` to the single application-level handler, ruling
**R-R30** -- exactly as every other producer needing a scenario refuses; a
transaction template or a savings transfer, which no loan bounds, still
renders for such an owner because the not-a-loan answer is reached first.

**Functions rather than Jinja attribute walks, and that is the point of the
module.**  Each of these decides something from more than one stored fact --
which shape a bound is in, whether a pattern is modelled, whether a template is
the loan's standing payment -- and deciding any of them in a template would put
a second statement of the rule in a place no gate reads.  Both forms take the
composed :class:`RecurrenceFormState` rather than five context keys, so they
cannot come to disagree about what the same rule means -- and ``duplicate-code``
said so the moment plan step R7b-4 made the two render blocks identical.

Route-layer rather than service because :func:`edit_form_cadence` flashes;
``CLAUDE.md::Architecture`` keeps services isolated from Flask globals.  The
leading underscore marks the module as route-internal.

    """Return what an EDIT form's "Ends" row starts on.

    The bound half of :func:`edit_form_cadence`, and the reason both edit
    routes call a function rather than reading the columns in Jinja: the
    control's three shapes are discriminated by which column is non-NULL
    (ruling R-R13's "absence is the discriminator", applied to the bound), and
    deciding that in a template would be a second statement of the shape set
    -- keyed on a name string, which this project rules out.

    **A LOCKED row shows the composed door's answer and never the column**
    (plan step R7d-f).  For the loan's standing payment the ``end_date`` column
    is the chokepoints' cache of the derived payoff, measurably behind on live
    data (plan ledger row **D35**: ``2029-01-22`` stored against ``2029-02-22``
    derived), and until this step the locked control displayed exactly that
    stale date under a sentence saying it came from the projected payoff.  The
    phrase is :func:`~app.services.recurrence.describe`'s, over the resolved
    value the door already narrowed -- ONE producer with the Recurring row's
    stop line, so the form cannot name a different date than the page that
    lists it.  Ruling **R-R30** decides the owner with no baseline scenario:
    the door refuses, and this function is never reached for them.

    **It cannot fail on an unreadable rule**, unlike :func:`edit_form_cadence`:
    the OPEN row reads the two bound columns and no cadence, so a rule naming a
    pattern the application no longer models still renders its stop correctly
    while the cadence controls render unset above the warning.  A form that
    lost the user's stop date because its cadence was unreadable would be the
    repair path destroying what it came to fix.  The locked row keeps that
    property by taking *resolved* from a caller that did not resolve such a
    rule: it shows no phrase rather than raising.

    Args:
        template: The ``TransactionTemplate`` or ``TransferTemplate`` being
            edited.  Read for ``recurrence_rule`` only; not mutated.
        resolved: What the definition's recurrence MEANS through the composed
            door, or ``None`` when there was nothing to resolve -- an open
            row (the caller resolves nothing it will not display), no rule,
            an unreadable cadence, or an owner with no pay periods.  Read only
            for a locked row.
        picker: The form's offer sets, for the "Never" label a locked row
            shows when nothing derived stops the definition -- the same word
            the open control offers for an unbounded rule, taken from the one
            place it is spelled.
        locked: Whether the app derives this definition's closing bound -- the
            definition is the standing payment of the loan it pays into.
            Decided once by the caller for both rows.

    Returns:
        The :class:`RecurrenceEnd`.

    Raises:
        RecurrenceResolutionError: The row carries both bound columns, which
            ``ck_recurrence_rules_single_end_bound`` refuses in the table.

"""The PATCH handler's FIELD-APPLICATION step.

**Split out of :mod:`.mutations` at plan step ``balance:X-bi-7a``**, whose
re-key of the override flip pushed that module to ``max-module-lines``; the
cut is the one X-au-j made for :mod:`._gates`, one step later in the same
handler: the gates run BEFORE this step, and what follows it
(``apply_requested_status``, the posting reconcile, the commit) stays with the
handler.

**Since plan step ``balance:X-bi-7b`` (leaf 7b-2) this step forks on the
row's SHAPE.**  A one-off is a rule-less definition plus its placed row
(ruling **R-BAL20**), and the grid popover is its whole lifecycle
(**R-BAL23**): the name, category and flags it posts are the DEFINITION's
and land there through the one act the template edit form calls
(:mod:`app.services.definition_edit`, ruling **R-BAL36**); a typed figure
corrects the definition's price IN PLACE and never detaches the row
(**R-BAL29**, **R-BAL37**); a period move RE-PLACES the row on the target
paycheck's start unless the owner had stated a day (**R-BAL33**); and a
moved due date carries ``occurs_on`` with it (**R-BAL25**).  A RECURRING
definition's row keeps every act it had: a typed figure or a period move
detaches it (OWN, ``is_override``), because that is a statement about one
occurrence among many.  A link-less row -- a legacy one-off until the
family's cutover, a CC payback -- keeps its own branch, frozen.

Boundary discipline: this writes the loaded row from the request's
already-schema-loaded ``data``; it issues no query of its own beyond the
lazy loads the row's accessors make and the definition edit's own, and it
does not commit.

# The PATCH fields the status seam writes, so the generic ``setattr`` loop in

# ``status_seam.apply_status_change`` writes them in a single statement after
# verifying the transition and expiring the ``status`` relationship.  A bare
# ``setattr`` would skip all of that, and for ``settled_on`` it would make the
# loop a SECOND writer of the column the seam is the single door to: exactly
# finding **N-183** (which ``update_transfer`` shipped and X-f1b closed), about
# to be re-run on the transaction side by this step's own edit door (finding
# **N-185**).  Naming the pair here is what keeps the loop from growing a third
# member silently.
#: The fields a SEAM owns, excluded from the field-application loop so it
#: cannot become a second writer of any of them.  ``settled_amount``
#: joined at plan step X-au-c3: it states WHAT MOVED, so a bare ``setattr``
#: could book money on a row that never settled and could do it beside a basis
#: saying something else.  It reaches the record only through
#: ``apply_requested_status``, which hands it to the settle verb or refuses it
#: with a designed 400 when no settle is happening.
#:
#: ``estimated_amount`` joined at plan step **X-au-k**, and it is the one
#: member this set no longer has to be TRUSTED about: the column is read-only
#: on the model now, so a ``setattr`` that reached it raises ``AttributeError``
#: rather than half-writing the amount-ownership pair.  It stays named here
#: because the loop must SKIP it deliberately rather than crash, and because a
#: reader asking which fields a seam owns should find all four in one place.

#: through :func:`definition_edit.apply_fields`, so the row's copies of the
#: first two are written by the propagation that brings every row of the
#: definition into line, and the flags -- which the row reads off its
#: definition -- are written nowhere on the row at all.  DERIVED from
#: :data:`definition_edit.EDITABLE_FIELDS` rather than spelled beside it, so

    The FIELD half of :func:`_apply_regular_update`, extracted so the handler
    keeps one exit per concern rather than growing a branch per rule.  SEVEN
    acts, numbered 0 to 6, and the order is load-bearing.  **This enumeration
    once said "three" and listed three while the body performed four** (found
    by X-au-j's adversarial review, in the one helper whose whole discipline
    is that its order matters), so every act is numbered below; leaf 7b-2 of
    ``X-bi-7b`` added the pop in act 0 and acts 2 and 4, each marked NEW.

    0. **The reads the later acts need, made BEFORE the loop.**  ``recurs``
       and ``is_placed`` may lazy-load the template, and a load after the
       loop autoflushes the moved period with the flag still False (act 5);
       the source paycheck's start is read off ``txn.pay_period`` while the
       foreign key still names it (the same column
       ``render_transaction_cell`` reads for the due caption, so the
       response's own load serves it from the identity map).  NEW: for a
       placed row the ITEM fields (:data:`_ITEM_FIELDS`) are taken out of
       ``data`` here, so the row loop never writes a definition's field
       onto the row and the handler's posting pre-filter never sees a
       ``category_id`` the propagation has already reconciled.
    1. the ``setattr`` loop over the ROW's fields.  ``status_id`` and
       ``settled_on`` are BOTH excluded and routed through the status verb
       instead: a bare ``setattr`` would assign the column but skip the
       transition check, the settle-day stamp/clear, and the
       status-relationship expire that ``status_seam.apply_status_change``
       owns -- and for ``settled_on`` it would make this loop a SECOND writer
       of a column the seam is the single door to (finding **N-185**, the
       re-run of N-183 on the transaction side).  A placed row's ``due_date``
       is excluded too: act 2 writes it.
    2. **NEW -- a placed row's DATE, through the one writer**
       (``one_off.state_due_date``, ruling **R-BAL25**: the row answers its
       own due date, so ``occurs_on`` moves with it).  The date is the
       owner's typed one, else the row's; a period move then RE-PLACES it
       (``one_off.due_date_after_move``, **R-BAL33**): the target
       paycheck's start unless the date was not the source paycheck's start,
       an owner-stated day read by position.  Before act 3 and act 4 because
       both read the row's date -- the restate corrects the version it
       reads, and the propagation re-declares the row at it.
    3. the FIGURE.  A RECURRING row's typed figure makes the row its OWN
       through ``amount_ownership.state_own_amount`` (shipped at X-au-c2b,
       restated at X-au-k): a hand-priced row OWNS its figure, so storing it
       RELEASES the relation that priced it, one act over one attribute.
       **A PLACED row's typed figure is the DEFINITION's** (rulings
       **R-BAL21** / **R-BAL29**): ``one_off.restate_price`` corrects the
       version the row's due date reads, in place, and declares the row
       priced by it with no flag -- which is also what re-attaches a row the
       interim between leaves 7b-1 and 7b-2 left OWN (**R-BAL37**).  A
       link-less row keeps the OWN write it always had.  **BEFORE act 4**,
       and an adversarial review is why: the propagation there selects rows
       that are not overridden, so a residue row re-attached here is reached
       by it in the same request (its category follows), where the other
       order left the row on its old category until the next edit; and the
       definition's amount and fields then flush together, so its
       optimistic-lock counter bumps once per edit rather than twice -- the
       same reason the template edit form states the amount BEFORE
       ``apply_fields``.
    4. **NEW -- the DEFINITION's fields** (:mod:`app.services.definition_edit`,
       rulings **R-BAL23** / **R-BAL36**): the item fields taken out at act 0
       are applied to ``txn.template`` -- a changed name reaches every row of
       the definition through the bulk rename -- and the rows it holds are
       brought into line, the row's own category and TEMPLATE ownership
       included, with their postings reconciled.  The flags need no
       propagation: the row reads them off its definition.  A row the
       interim detached (``is_override``) and NOT re-priced in this request
       is skipped by that propagation, as any overridden row is (its category
       waits for its next typed figure, or the cutover).  **Here, BEFORE the
       status arm, because the flags govern the settle**: a save that unticks
       *Track individual purchases* beside Status = Paid settles the row on
       its own figure (act 6's own sentence), which needs the definition's
       flag written first.  The price of that order is a crafted single PATCH
       that REVERTS a settled placed row and re-categorises it in one request
       (the card disables the category select on a locked row, so no form
       posts that pair): the propagation runs while the row is still settled
       and skips it, so the definition takes the category and the row keeps
       the old one until its next category edit reaches it.  Found by
       adversarial review and left, because the other order breaks the
       reachable save.
    5. ``is_override``, which sits with the field writes and ABOVE both the
       refusal below and the status work: act 6 FLUSHES, so a flag written
       after it is written after the UPDATE it belongs in -- which for a
       period move leaves the row inside the generation index's partial
       predicate (``is_override = FALSE``) while its period is already the
       new one.  **Plan step R17 narrowed what that can collide with but
       did not remove it**: the dated index is keyed
       ``(template, scenario, occurs_on)`` and a move of a RECURRING row
       does not touch ``occurs_on``, so a DATED row no longer collides with
       whatever the engine put in the target period; an UNDATED
       template-linked row is still keyed on its paycheck by
       ``idx_transactions_template_scenario_undated``, so there the ordering
       is exactly as load-bearing as it was.  (For a PLACED row act 4 has
       already flushed, and correctly: such a row takes no flag.)  **The
       flag says ONE thing since plan step X-au-h: this row is the OWNER's,
       not the rule's** -- and since this leaf it is made ONLY where the
       definition RECURS, for a typed figure or a period move alike
       (**R-BAL28**'s stated end): a rule-less definition runs no pass to
       keep off the row, its typed figure lives on the definition now, and a
       flag there would only hide the row from the propagation of act 4 and
       from a rule added later (**R-BAL25**).  Both acts were presence tests
       before -- the amount's is finding **N-248**, and the period's had the
       identical shape, because the popover renders a period dropdown on
       every row and posts it whether or not it was touched;
       ``period_changed`` is computed by the caller BEFORE the loop rewrites
       ``pay_period_id``.
    6. the derived-amount refusal, asked AFTER the loop so ``tracks_purchases``
       reads the RESULTING row: unchecking "Track individual purchases" in the
       same save legitimately gives the row its own amount back.  **It reads
       a LAZY relationship and therefore autoflushes**, which is why this
       whole helper is called from inside the caller's exception net rather
       than above it.

    **The refusal is ruling R-FF's**, the same sentence the reconcile panel
    already obeys ("a tick is correctable exactly when the settle verb takes its
    MANUAL branch"), applied to the second door that offers an amount box.  An
    envelope carrying purchases settles at ``sum(entries)``, so a figure typed
    beside it is not a correction the app can honour: it would be written here,
    overwritten by the settle, and never mentioned.  The popover no longer
    renders the input for such a row (``amount_correctable``), so this is the
    crafted-request and stale-form backstop.  Only a REAL figure is refused: an
    empty box loads as an explicit ``None`` (the field is ``allow_none``), which
    states no amount at all.

    A refused call has already staged the ``setattr`` loop's mutations;
    ``_error_transaction_response`` rolls them back, exactly as the settle-day
    refusal in the caller already relies on.

    Args:
        txn: The Transaction being edited.
        data: The schema-loaded PATCH payload, with the rendered-figure
            companion already removed by the caller.  A placed row's item
            fields are REMOVED from it here (act 0).
        amount_authored: Whether a HUMAN typed the ``estimated_amount`` this
            payload carries (ruling **R-JR**).  Decides whether the row takes
            ownership of the figure (a recurring or link-less row) or its
            definition is restated (a placed row).
        period_changed: Whether this payload MOVES the row to another period.
            Passed in because the caller computes it before the loop below
            rewrites ``pay_period_id``, at which point it can no longer be
            asked.
        target_period: The paycheck the row moves to, as the owner's
            calendar derived it for the FK probe, or ``None`` when the
            payload names none.  Never ``None`` when *period_changed*.

    Returns:
        A designed 400 response tuple, or ``None`` when every field was

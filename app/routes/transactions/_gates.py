"""The PATCH handler's PRE-MUTATION GATE CHAIN.

**Split out of :mod:`.mutations` at plan step X-au-j**, whose CC-payback
refusal pushed that module past ``max-module-lines``.  The cut is the seam
``_apply_field_updates``'s own docstring already names: these run BEFORE the
``setattr`` loop dirties the session, so an illegal transition reports ahead of
a finalised-field lock or an FK error and the row is left untouched on
rejection.  They share one error exit, which is what keeps the handler inside
pylint's return-count limit as the arc adds refusals to it.

**It holds TWO of the chain's three guards, and says which and why rather
than claiming the set.**  The third, ``_helpers._finalised_edit_response``,
stays where it is: it was shared with ``._shadow_mutations`` until leaf
``balance:X-bi-6-1`` deleted that module, and moving it here now would be a
change with no caller asking for it.  A first draft of this docstring said
"in one place", which an adversarial review measured as false.

Every guard here answers the same shape -- ``(txn, data) -> response | None``,
where ``None`` means *this gate passes*.  A route-tier guard is the
crafted-request and stale-form BACKSTOP for a rule the popover already obeys by
not rendering the control; the rule itself lives in the service or the model.

**The STALE-FORM check joined at plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``**
(:func:`_stale_form_conflict`), when the popover's posted bank lines pushed
``mutations`` past the line cap again.  It runs AHEAD of the chain -- in the
door, before ``_apply_regular_update`` -- and answers a 409 rather than a
400, but it is the same shape over the same payload and writes nothing, which
is this module's whole membership test.

Boundary discipline: these read the request's already-schema-loaded ``data`` and
the loaded row, and write nothing.

def _reject_generated_due_date_edit(txn, data):
    """Refuse a due-date edit on a row a recurring definition generated.

    **A generated row's due date is its DEFINITION's** (plan step
    balance:X-au-e, developer 2026-09-03).  ``due_date`` is a member of
    ``recurrence_engine._amounts.DerivedRowFields``: generation computes it
    from the rule and the period, and the maintain splat rewrites it on every
    regeneration -- so an edit here never survived a later template save even
    before this step.  What X-au-e added is that the same date now resolves the
    row's PRICE through amount rule 3, so the field has gone from an edit that
    did not last to one that can leave a row no rule is able to price.

    **Clearing it 500ed the whole grid**, and that is measured rather than
    argued: ``routes/grid/page`` prices every row it loads with no status
    predicate and no handler -- ``AmountUnresolvable`` has five handlers in
    ``app/`` and none of them is on that path -- so ONE dateless derived row
    takes out the grid, the dashboard and the companion until the row is
    repaired in the database.  Reproduced on a clone of production: the
    identical act leaves 926 rows pricing cleanly before the cutover and
    raising after it.

    The popover no longer renders the control for such a row (it shows the
    date as text and names where the edit belongs), so this is the
    crafted-request and stale-form backstop this module exists to be.

    **Keyed on PRESENCE rather than on emptiness**, for the reason the payback
    gate states one function down: what a generated row may not accept is the
    FIELD.  Moving the date is refused as well as clearing it -- a moved date
    re-prices the row against a different point in its definition's series,
    silently, and the next regeneration puts it back.

    **Which rows it refuses is keyed on ``Transaction.recurs`` since plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-7a``, not on the link**, and the three shapes get
    three answers.  A row a RULE generated: the FIELD is refused, above.  A
    LINK-LESS row (ad-hoc, a CC payback, a transfer shadow): untouched -- it
    owns its figure or is priced through its parent, so amount rule 1 or 5
    answers it and nothing reads its date; the form still offers it,
    clearable.  A RULE-LESS DEFINITION's row: the date is the OWNER's to
    state (ruling **R-BAL22** -- due on its placed paycheck's start unless
    the owner says otherwise), no cadence derives it and no regeneration puts
    it back, so MOVING it is allowed.  **The price follows the date**: the
    row is priced by its definition's series AS OF that day (amount rule 3),
    so a definition whose cadence the owner CLEARED and whose series still
    holds several versions re-prices a row moved across a version boundary --
    the amount model's own answer, stated rather than refused, and measured
    (``test_one_off_row_doors``); a one-off's series holds ONE version once
    the doors leaf mints it (**R-BAL21**), and then the move prices nothing
    differently.  CLEARING it is not allowed: the same rule 3 needs the day,
    which is what ``ck_transactions_template_row_needs_due_date`` (plan step
    X-bv-2) says in storage.  The CHECK would refuse the clear
    anyway; this arm exists so the owner reads *why* rather than the generic
    invalid-reference sentence a constraint hit renders, which is the
    screens-stating-what-is-false defect this arc keeps closing.  The popover
    renders the input ``required`` for such a row since leaf 7b-2 of
    ``X-bi-7b``, so this arm is the crafted-request and stale-form backstop
    every guard in this module is.  A MOVED date carries ``occurs_on`` with
    it at the field write (ruling **R-BAL25**), which is not this gate's to
    do.

    **A payback's figure is not its own to state** (finding **N-252**): it
    repays the card spend of the row it names, so the figure is a fact about
    THAT row.  ``transaction_service.repays_card_spend``'s docstring carries
    the rule and what it cost -- ``$58.40`` on production payback 2590, edited
    to ``$123.18`` against ``$181.58`` of credit purchases and settled there,

    for reading the stored type.  A first draft ran it after the ``setattr``
    loop and relied on ``_error_transaction_response``'s rollback to unstage
    the write; running it as a gate means the write is never staged at all.

    **Keyed on PRESENCE, not on the value.**  That reads stricter than the
    settled-actual refusal one module over (``data.get(...) is not None``) and
    resolves to the same set today: ``estimated_amount`` is not ``allow_none``,
    so ``_normalize_empty_inputs`` DROPS an empty submit instead of loading

    as a presence test anyway, because what this row may not accept is the

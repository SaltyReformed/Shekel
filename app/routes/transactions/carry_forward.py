"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transaction route package: carry-forward handlers.

The carry-forward preview (GET, read-only plan) and the carry-forward
mutator (POST), which copy a past period's unpaid items into the current
period.  Both apply identical ownership / configuration checks via the
shared :func:`_resolve_carry_forward_context`.

**The Confirm posts back the bank lines the preview NAMED, and a stale one is
drawn again** (plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``, leaf 5c-2c-2; rulings
**R-CC76**, **R-CC127**, **R-CC128**, **R-CC135**): the modal says which
lines the batch would leave unexplained on the statement screen, the POST
hands them to the batch's one press, and a batch that would free other lines
-- a match made or undone in another tab since the modal was drawn -- saves
nothing and redraws the modal's content from what is true now.

def _resolve_carry_forward_context(period_id):
    """Resolve the calendar, both periods, and the baseline scenario.

    Shared by both ``carry_forward`` (POST mutator) and
    ``carry_forward_preview`` (GET preview) so they apply identical
    ownership and configuration checks.

    Each return is a ``(payload, status, headers)`` tuple where
    *payload* is None when the lookups succeed.  Caller pattern:

        ctx, err = _resolve_carry_forward_context(period_id)
        if err is not None:
            return err
        balance_ctx, source_period, current_period = ctx

    **ONE READ PASS answers everything this render asks about the schedule**
    (pay-calendar plan step C2-f3c, closing ledger row **P68**; plan step
    R7d-c-1 made it a pass where it was a bare calendar).  Both periods, the
    baseline scenario and the recurrence engine's write window come off it,
    and it is handed to ``carry_forward_service`` so the service opens none of
    its own.  The render derived TWO calendars before C2-f3c -- one here and
    one inside the service's ``GenerationSchedule`` -- which was measured on
    the arch fixture at 1 -> 2 derivations and 12 -> 13 queries when plan step
    C2-f3a replaced a SQL reader here.  It also held a
    ``get_baseline_scenario`` beside the derivation, which is the second of
    the two facts a pass pins.

    **Both periods are ANSWERED BY THE CALENDAR, which is what makes the
    ownership check structural.**  The source is a user-supplied id and used to
    be a ``db.session.get`` plus a hand-written ``source.user_id !=
    current_user.id`` comparison; a calendar holds one owner's whole schedule
    and nothing else, so an id that is not in it is not this owner's and the
    404 covers "no such period" and "not yours" with one answer -- the
    project's security response rule expressed as a lookup rather than as a
    guard.  The target is "which paycheck is this owner in now", which
    ``pay_period_service.get_current_period`` answered in SQL with no
    ``ORDER BY`` against the process clock (ledger rows **P19**, **P49**).
    The day is ``display_today()``, the owner's own civil day.

    ``None`` from :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar
    .period_containing` keeps its meaning and its 400: no SAVED period covers
    today, so there is nowhere to carry TO.  ``span_containing`` would answer a
    projected period past the horizon whose ``period_id`` is ``None``, and
    every row this operation writes needs one.

    Returns:
        Tuple of ``((balance_ctx, source_period, current_period), None)`` on
        success, or ``(None, error_response)`` on failure.  The error response
        is a Flask-compatible ``(body, status_code)`` tuple that the caller
        returns directly to HTMX.  Both periods are
        :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` values, and the
        scenario is read off the pass rather than returned beside it.

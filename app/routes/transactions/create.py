"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transaction route package: create handlers.

The POST routes that create a ONE-OFF: the inline grid-cell create and the
Add Transaction modal's full create.  Both verify every user-scoped FK
through the shared :func:`_resolve_owned_fks` IDOR probe, then hand what
the form said to the one producer of a one-off
(:func:`app.services.one_off.place_one_off`, plan step ``balance:X-bi-7b``):
a rule-less DEFINITION carrying the name, category, flags and price, plus
the one row it places in the submitted paycheck.  Neither route constructs a
``Transaction`` any more -- a bare ``Transaction(**data)`` was how a
link-less row came to carry its own flags and figure (ruling **R-BAL20**).

    ``AmountOwnership.own(...)`` onto the row.  The flags the form posts are

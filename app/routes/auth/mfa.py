"""
Shekel Budget App -- Auth route package: MFA lifecycle.

The TOTP multi-factor family, deliberately co-located: login-time
verification (``/mfa/verify``, consuming the pending state the login
route in :mod:`~app.routes.auth.credentials` establishes), enrolment
(``/mfa/setup`` + ``/mfa/confirm``), backup-code regeneration, and
disablement (GET confirmation + POST).  Each route registers against
the shared ``auth_bp`` from :mod:`~app.routes.auth._bp`; the pending-
state freshness/cleanup helpers, the replay-logging TOTP verifier, the
backup-code consumer, and the setup TTL constant come from
:mod:`~app.routes.auth._helpers` so this module and the step-up
``/reauth`` flow enforce one replay-prevention policy.

    Clears every piece of stored MFA material -- the TOTP secret,
    backup codes, the recorded replay-prevention step, and any pending
    setup ciphertext -- and sets is_enabled to False, via the
    :func:`mfa_service.clear_mfa_material` rule shared with
    ``scripts/reset_mfa.py`` so the route and the emergency CLI cannot
    drift on the field set.  The TOTP step is verified through
    :func:`mfa_service.verify_totp_code` with replay prevention
    enforced -- an attacker who has captured the user's password and a
    recently-used TOTP code cannot use that code to disable MFA, the
    same defence that ``/mfa/verify`` provides at login.

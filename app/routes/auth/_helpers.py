"""
Shekel Budget App -- Auth route package: shared constants and helpers.

Single source for the security constants and private helpers the auth
sub-modules co-own.  The MFA pending-state cluster
(``_MFA_PENDING_KEYS`` / ``_MFA_PENDING_MAX_AGE`` /
:func:`_clear_mfa_pending_state` / :func:`_mfa_pending_is_fresh`) spans
the two halves of the login flow -- the password POST in
:mod:`~app.routes.auth.credentials` writes the keys, ``/mfa/verify`` in
:mod:`~app.routes.auth.mfa` enforces freshness and clears them -- so it
lives here rather than in either route module; a typo on any one key
would silently break the flow, which is why the key names are
centralised at all.  :func:`_verify_totp_with_replay_logging` (and its
backup-code sibling :func:`_consume_backup_code`) is shared by
``/mfa/verify``, ``/mfa/disable``, and the step-up ``/reauth`` so all
three enforce one replay-prevention policy.
:func:`_first_validation_message` and :func:`_is_safe_redirect` are the
cross-module form-error and open-redirect utilities.

    the REPLAY/ACCEPTED branches inline.  Pulling the three-way enum
    handling into a helper restores the route to a flat sequence of
    business steps and keeps each function within Pylint's limits.

    On REPLAY, emits the structured ``totp_replay_rejected`` event
    that F-142 requires.  The event includes ``user_id`` and
    ``ip`` so SOC tooling can correlate replay attempts to a
    specific account and source address.

    On ACCEPTED, commits the SQLAlchemy session so
    ``mfa_config.last_totp_timestep`` -- which the verifier mutated
    in place -- persists across requests.  Without this commit, a
    crash later in the route would leave the matched step
    un-recorded and replayable on a retry.

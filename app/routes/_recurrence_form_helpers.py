Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence-Form Route Helpers (F-24, F-26)

What a template's recurrence rule IS after a form submit, for the
transaction-template (:mod:`app.routes.templates`) and transfer-template
(:mod:`app.routes.transfers`) CRUD routes.  What happens to the ROWS that rule
already generated is the sibling module
:mod:`app.routes._recurrence_conflict_chooser`, split out at plan step R2e-1
when this one reached the 1,000-line cap.  What an EDIT form's controls START
ON is :mod:`app.routes._recurrence_form_render`, split out at plan step R7b-4
when it reached that cap a second time -- the seam being SUBMISSION versus
STORED STATE: everything here reads a posted payload and writes, everything
there answers a read-only question about a definition already saved.

The helpers:

* :func:`recurrence_spec_for_create` -- the whole create-form
  preamble both kinds run: lift the closing bound out of the payload, build
  the context, read the spec.  Hoisted at plan step R7b-4, which is when it
  became hoistable;
* :func:`author_recurrence_for_create` -- its WRITE half, which plan step
  R-F6 separated from it: the rule is authored onto the definition, so it
  cannot be written until the definition exists and the two halves run either
  side of the caller's model constructor;
* :func:`recurrence_spec_from_form` -- consumes a Marshmallow-
  validated payload, pops the recurrence-related keys, and returns the
  :class:`~app.services.recurrence.RecurrenceSpec` it states or ``None`` when
  no cadence was selected.  It WROTE the rule until plan step R-F6, which
  moved the owning FK onto ``budget.recurrence_rules`` -- so a rule cannot be
  written before the definition that owns it exists, and reading the
  submission is now a separate step from writing it.  [F-24]
* :func:`update_recurrence_rule_from_form` -- sibling of the builder
  for the cadence-changed-on-an-existing-rule branch: re-points the
  template's current :class:`RecurrenceRule` in place (preserving its
  id and the owning FK), pops the recurrence keys, and returns
  ``None``; it cannot fail.  [F-24]
* :func:`resolve_recurrence_rule_for_update` -- dispatches the three
  update-form branches (re-point an existing rule, build + link a new
  one, or CLEAR the recurrence the user set to "Does not repeat") so
  each ``update_*`` route resolves its recurrence rule with a single
  call.  [F-24; the clear branch is plan step R2e-1]

The first three helpers share a verbatim trio of inputs -- the form's
closing bound, the validation-error redirect target, and the
transaction-vs-transfer ``due_day_of_month`` flag -- bundled into the
frozen :class:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.RecurrenceFormContext`,
which is DEFINED in the refusals module since plan step R7d-f (see there for
why the leaf moved) and imported here.

**Everything about OPTIMISTIC LOCKING left at plan step R7c-b**, which is the
third time this module met the 1,000-line cap and the first time the cut was
available for free: ``handle_stale_form_conflict`` and the two
``STALE_*_MESSAGE`` templates moved to :mod:`app.routes._commit_helpers`,
where the guard's own commit-time siblings (``commit_or_handle_stale``,
``handle_stale_conflict``) had already gone for the same reason.  None of the
three was about recurrence -- the savings-goal form and the amount-version
actions imported them from here, across a boundary that had nothing to say
about them.

**Every REFUSAL left at the same step**, when the inverted-window door made a
fourth one and the module met the cap again:
:mod:`app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals` holds the three refusal messages,
:func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.is_loan_payment`,
:func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.refuse_inverted_window` and the
:func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.refuse_recurrence_update`
dispatcher that asks them in order.  The seam is "may this submission be
applied at all" against "apply it", and it runs ONE way -- that module imports
nothing from this one.  Since plan step R7d-f the context both sides read is
defined THERE, so each refusal entry takes it whole, with the READ PASS beside
it: the update path judges a stored definition against the pass the route
built before any write (``pass_ctx``), and the calendar every re-author here
resolves against is taken from that pass rather than loaded by the helper.

Route-layer module rather than service because these helpers consume
Flask ``flash`` / ``redirect`` / ``url_for`` (the last two via
:class:`~app.routes._redirect_target.RedirectTarget`);
``CLAUDE.md::Architecture`` keeps services isolated from Flask globals.
The leading underscore marks the module as route-internal.

    (``transfers.create_transfer_template``).  A kind-agnostic helper
    checking a field only one kind submits was the coupling; moving it
    removed the coupling and the failure mode together.

    **It does NOT validate the cadence.**  That the submitted axes name values
    the application MODELS -- narrower than "name ``ref`` rows", and the

    Sibling of :func:`recurrence_spec_from_form` for the

    that same row in place -- preserving its primary key and its owning
    arc -- rather than creating a
    new rule, then pops every recurrence key from ``data`` so the

    closed defects.**  The pre-seam version wrote the payload onto the

    **D1**: ``offset_periods`` went to 0 on an amount-only edit,

            write, and its ``calendar()`` memo is that schedule already
            derived, so the pre-write side of an update derives it once.
            (Regeneration afterwards builds a fresh pass and derives its own,
            as it did before; this step removed no load from that side.)

        R2e-2 changed: the one failure it used to have -- an unmodelled cadence

    # when the form did not.  See the two lines below.

    # ``interval_n`` is written for EVERY unit from plan step R7c-c, and the
    # paragraph that stood here said the reverse.  While the closed pattern set
    # was the storage, the column held the authored count for ``Every N
    # Periods`` and ``1`` for every pattern whose interval was baked into its
    # NAME -- so a Quarterly rule's column read as monthly and the interval a
    # calendar cadence repeated on was recovered through ``pattern_id``.  That
    # is what R7c-c's migration re-points: the column now means "how many units
    # pass between occurrences" for all four units, and what this form posts
    # reaches it verbatim.
    #
    # Which is exactly why a MISSING interval may no longer be defaulted -- see
    # the pop above.  The old sentence "no value this form can submit is able to
    # say a Quarterly bill recurs monthly" was true only because the pattern
    # held the interval; once the column does, the default WAS such a value.
    # **Read with the SUBMITTED cadence, never the stored one**, and the
    # difference is the repair path this form advertises: an edit page may be
    # showing a rule whose stored unit or placement the application no longer
    # models (``edit_form_cadence`` renders the controls UNSET and
    # ``UNREADABLE_CADENCE_MESSAGE`` says to choose a cadence before saving),
    # and reading that rule's cadence on the way to REPLACING it raises.
    # Measured against ``origin/dev``: routing this through ``recurrence_spec``
    # turned the one action the surface tells the user to take into a 500.

    # states the axes -- so what arrives here is what the user chose.

    What "this no longer recurs" means on the write side: the row stating the
    cadence ceases to exist.  Merely detaching would produce exactly the orphan
    finding **F-6** measured on the hard-delete path, from a second door.

    **This used to be five statements and a census, and plan step R-F6 made it
    one.**  While the FK pointed from the template at the rule, two templates
    could name one row, so a delete here had to count the OTHER references
    first (``_rule_is_exclusively_owned``, deleted with this rewrite) and log
    a warning when it found one -- a runtime probe standing in for a
    constraint the schema could not carry.  The FK is on the rule now, under a
    unique index per arm, so "this rule is this template's and no other's" is
    true by construction and there is nothing left to ask.  Dis-associating it
    is what deletes it: the relationship carries ``delete-orphan``.

    Flushed before returning so the DELETE lands in statement order here rather
    than wherever the unit of work's dependency sort would put it -- the same
    reason the previous shape flushed.  **Not** because a caller re-authors
    onto this template in the same request: an adversarial review of plan step
    R-F6 measured that it cannot, since the one caller
    (:func:`resolve_recurrence_rule_for_update`) reaches the clear only on the
    branch where no cadence was submitted.  What the flush buys is that a
    destructive statement is legible where it is written.

    Args:
        template: The ``TransactionTemplate`` or ``TransferTemplate`` whose

    Dispatches the three update-form branches shared by
    :func:`app.routes.templates.update_template` and
    :func:`app.routes.transfers.templates.update_transfer_template`:

    * pattern present AND the template already owns a rule -> re-point
      that row in place via :func:`update_recurrence_rule_from_form`
      (its primary key and its owning arc stay stable);
    * pattern present, no existing rule -> read the submission with
      :func:`recurrence_spec_from_form` and author it ONTO the template via
      :func:`app.services.recurrence.author_rule`, which is what links it;
    * pattern SUBMITTED AS EMPTY -> the user chose "Does not repeat", so any
      existing rule is cleared through :func:`_clear_recurrence_rule` --
      unless the template is a LOAN PAYMENT (see
      :data:`LOAN_PAYMENT_CANNOT_BE_ONE_TIME`) or its stored rule names a
      pattern this application no longer models (see
      :data:`UNREPAIRED_CADENCE_CANNOT_BE_CLEARED`), either of which is
      refused.

    **A submitted-empty pattern and an absent one are different requests**, and
    keeping them apart is what stops the third branch from breaking the
    partial-update contract.  Both schemas declare ``recurrence_unit`` as
    ``allow_none``, so the form's "Does not repeat" option survives
    ``_normalize_empty_inputs`` as a present ``None`` while a field the caller
    never submitted stays absent -- and only the first clears.  Without that
    distinction an amount-only PATCH, which submits no recurrence keys at all,
    would silently delete the template's cadence.

    **The third branch is new, and its absence was a live defect.**  The
    transaction form has offered a "does not repeat" option since the recurring
    cluster shipped, and selecting it did nothing at all: the builder returned
    ``None``, this function assigned nothing, and the template kept both its
    rule and its cadence.  Worse than inert -- the caller then regenerated
    from the rule the user had just asked it to stop using.  Measured on a
    real edit of an every-paycheck template::

        rule_id before: 1   rows: 10
        rule_id after:  1   rows: 10
        (log) deleted_count=6  created_count=6

    **A LOAN PAYMENT is refused rather than cleared**, because clearing it
    produces a state the domain does not have: an amortizing loan still
    amortizes, so a payment that does not repeat leaves the loan with no
    cadence to project against.  It is not a cosmetic refusal -- measured, the
    clear silently re-dated a loan's payoff, because
    ``recurring_transfer_query.active_recurring_transfer_template`` finds a
    loan's payment by whether a rule names it, and deleting that rule
    drops the standing overpayment the balance seam threads::

        loan standing extra before: 250.00
        loan standing extra after:    0.00
        loan_payment_settings row still asserts: 250.00

    The template's own ``LoanPaymentSettings`` row would go on claiming an
    extra principal nothing reads.  The two real intents each have a door:
    change the cadence (pick another pattern) or stop paying (archive it).

    Whether the instances that rule already generated are swept is the
    CALLER's half of the same edit; see
    :func:`~app.routes._recurrence_conflict_chooser.regenerate_or_conflict_chooser`.

    The owning row's user scope comes from ``template.user_id`` -- the
    caller fetched the template through an owner-scoped ``get_or_404``,
    so this equals the pre-extraction ``current_user.id``.

    Args:
        template: The ``TransactionTemplate`` or ``TransferTemplate``
            being updated.  Accessed for ``recurrence_rule`` (which a
            fresh rule is authored onto, and which is cleared when none
            was selected) and ``user_id``.  Mutated in place.
        data: Marshmallow-validated payload; the recurrence keys are
            popped by the delegated helper.  Read for whether
            ``recurrence_unit`` and ``starts_on`` are PRESENT before those
            pops consume them.
        ctx: The :class:`RecurrenceFormContext` forwarded unchanged to
            the delegated builder / updater (its ``end_bound``,
            ``redirect`` target, and ``include_due_day_of_month`` flag).
        pass_ctx: The read pass the route built BEFORE this write (plan step
            R7d-f).  The refusals judge the stored definition against it --
            the loan's standing payment is read off its loan-resolution memo,
            and only when a rule can turn on it -- and the calendar every
            branch below authors against is its ``calendar()``, so the
            pre-write side derives the owner's schedule once.  Regeneration
            afterwards builds a FRESH pass, as a writer must: a pass built
            here would memoise the loan as it stood before the re-author.

    Returns:
        * ``None`` -- the rule was resolved; the caller continues to
          the field-update loop.
        * :class:`Response` -- a Flask redirect for one of the refusals

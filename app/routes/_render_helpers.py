Shekel Budget App -- Shared Transaction-Cell Render Helper

The cross-blueprint home for rendering a transaction's grid cell.
Every HTMX response that re-renders a cell -- the transaction CRUD and
status routes, and the entries CRUD routes' out-of-band cell refresh --
must ship the same context (notably ``entry_sums`` and ``budgets``, which drive
the amount display and the envelope progress), so the render has exactly one
definition with a public name instead of a module-private helper imported across
blueprint packages.  Follows the package-level shared-helper convention
of ``app/routes/_commit_helpers.py``.

    A row is a PLAN until its money moves and a RECORD of what moved once it has

    the plan otherwise.  All three are needed to render one cell, so they are
    resolved by ONE call and travel together -- a caller cannot take the budget
    and forget the settlement.

    **That pairing is a defect fixed rather than a convenience.**  An adversarial
    review of plan step X-au-c2b found the display rule written twice and
    differently, because each surface assembled its own context: the grid laid
    the seam's override map over the resolved one while every HTMX fragment
    published the resolved map ALONE under the same key, so one row showed two
    figures on two surfaces the same click opened.  Two independently-passed maps
    are the same shape of mistake one map further on.

    **The third map is the developer's 2026-08-17 rule that whatever will be
    booked against the account is shown wherever the row is shown.**  A row
    reverted out of the settled band KEEPS what it recorded and a re-settle
    honours it, so its plan is what the balance counts and its retained figure is
    what a tick books.  Those are two different numbers about one row, and the
    second was visible on no surface but the reconcile panel -- the grid and the
    full-edit popover both showed a ``$500.00`` plan for a row that would book
    ``$245.32``.  It rides in this dataclass for the same reason the second one

def transfer_budgets(xfer: Transfer) -> "dict[int, Decimal]":
    """Return ``{transfer_id: what this transfer's amount IS}``, one entry.

    The transfer twin of :attr:`RenderAmounts.budgets`, and the ONE producer
    every surface showing a transfer's figure reads (plan step **X-au-f**).
    The three transfer fragments -- the cell, the quick edit and the full-edit
    popover -- took ``xfer.amount`` straight off the parent until this step,
    which was correct exactly while a generated transfer STORED its figure.
    That column empties for a generated transfer at this step's cutover leaf,
    at which point a template reading it renders Jinja's ``None`` into a money
    box and posts the literal string ``"None"`` back through
    ``TransferUpdateSchema`` (which refuses it).  Asking the amount model
    instead is the same move ``routes/transactions/forms`` already made for the
    transaction popover.

    **It is a MAP rather than a scalar for the reason
    :func:`fragment_amounts` states**: two of the three fragments POST this
    figure back into a money box, and a missing scalar renders ``value=""`` in
    silence where an absent map raises.  **What it does NOT buy is protection
    from the WRONG map**, and an adversarial review is why that is written
    down: ``budgets`` is one context key over two id spaces that are not
    disjoint, so a transaction-keyed map handed to a transfer fragment answers
    a HIT rather than a ``KeyError``.  No path does that today -- the one route
    that could, ``transactions/forms.get_full_edit``, returns from inside its
    shadow branch before any transaction map is built -- and the guarantee is
    that a MISSING map is loud, not that a mismatched one is.

    **It is SEPARATE from :func:`transfer_settlement_amounts` rather than a
    third field on it, and the split is by what each surface renders.**  The
    quick edit shows a PLAN and nothing else, while that producer loads the
    shadow pair and reads two settlement records to answer -- so bundling them
    would make the quick-edit swap pay for two figures it does not display.
    The popover shows all three and calls both; so does the transfers page's
    CELL since leaf ``X-bi-6-1`` closed finding **N-303** (it showed the plan
    over a figure just corrected, because it was handed neither map).  *A
    first draft of this paragraph cited finding N-296 for that cost and an
    adversarial review opened the row: N-296 is a per-DEFINITION eager load in
    BATCH callers, whose remedy is `pricing_load_options` and whose step is
    `X-bm`.  It says nothing about this.  The argument above needs no
    citation.*

    **SINGLE-ROW reads only**, the boundary :attr:`Transfer.settled_on`
    documents, and the leaf that stated that boundary in advance has arrived.
    Plan step X-au-f-2 gave a loan payment's PARENT its producer (ruling
    **R-BAL10**), so this now builds a read pass and one call per row is what
    an N+1 would look like.  A transfer that owns its figure or reads its
    definition's series still costs no query -- the basis resolves nothing
    until a rule asks it -- and only a DERIVE-mode loan payment reaches the
    loan.  The one batch surface -- the grid, which since leaf ``X-bi-6-1``
    draws a transfer's LEGS off the parent -- prices them through
    :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.leg_amounts_by_key` with the page's
    own basis (``routes/grid/_items.build_amount_maps``), the same resolver
    this calls; every parent-transfer render site here is a one-row HTMX
    swap.

    **The basis is BUILT here rather than threaded, exactly as the transaction
    twin builds one** (:func:`fragment_amounts`, whose comment carries the
    argument): a FRAGMENT has no read pass to take one from -- it is reached by
    an HTMX swap that loaded nothing else -- and a pass-shaped caller builds
    one basis for everything it loaded instead.  It is pinned off the
    transfer's OWN columns, which is what makes it right for the row being
    priced whichever of the nine sites called.

    Args:
        xfer: The transfer the fragment renders.  It states no ownership rule of
            its own and needs none: it reads neither ``user_id`` nor
            ``scenario_id`` and, on the OWN arm, issues no query at all, so
            there is nothing here to scope.  Eight of the nine callers reach it
            through an owner-scoped load; the ninth
            (``routes/transactions/forms.get_full_edit``) establishes ownership
            TRANSITIVELY, its shadow having passed ``_get_owned_transaction``
            and :func:`transfer_settlement_amounts` refusing a foreign or
            soft-deleted parent one line earlier.  Stated rather than claimed
            uniform, because an adversarial review measured the difference.

    than assembling it, because the popover is reachable from two blueprints --
    the transfers page and a grid SHADOW cell -- and a rule written at each is
    how one click shows a different figure from another.

    htmx sends the browser's current URL with every request it makes

    ``process``es too), and the grid's balance line is a function of that
    URL: ``/grid?account_id=<card>`` puts the card on the line.  A fragment
    that re-draws one cell of that page must read the same override the page
    read, so it takes it from the header the way the page takes it from
    ``request.args`` -- through werkzeug's own ``type=int`` coercion, so the

    client) therefore reads the primary, as every fragment resolved before

    every ``accounts.*`` page carries its id as a PATH parameter, so its

    """Render a parent transfer's grid cell with the context it must carry.

    **The transfer twin of :func:`render_transaction_cell`, and this module's
    own opening paragraph is what it satisfies**: every HTMX response that
    re-renders a cell must ship the same context, *so the render has exactly one
    definition with a public name*.  The transaction cell had that; the transfer
    cell had SIX hand-assembled ``render_template`` calls across three modules
    and two blueprints, each repeating ``xfer``, a ``resolve_grid_account``
    lookup, and -- once plan step **X-au-f-1** made the figure a resolved one --
    a ``budgets`` map.

    **It was extracted at the moment the required context GREW, which is the
    only moment the omission is cheap.**  A seventh site added later without
    ``budgets`` is not a blank cell: Jinja raises on the subscript, so it is a
    500 on a live money surface, and on five of the six sites that surface is
    already an ERROR path -- a 409 conflict fragment or a designed 4xx -- where a
    500 replaces the message the user needed.  Naming the render once removes
    the way to forget.

    The ACCOUNT is resolved here rather than passed, because all six callers
    resolved the same thing from the same two arguments; it decides which
    direction arrow the cell draws.  Since plan step ``credit_card:CC-4-2`` the
    resolution is :func:`fragment_balance_line`'s -- the page's own, override
    included -- shared with the transaction cell and the mobile card, so the
    three fragments cannot name the balance line three ways, nor one way the
    page does not.

    **It publishes what the pair RECORDED and what a re-settle would RE-BOOK
    beside the plan** (leaf ``X-bi-6-1``, closing finding **N-303**): the
    cell was handed ``budgets`` alone and so painted the plan over a figure
    the same click's popover had just corrected -- the "one row, two figures
    on two surfaces" shape :class:`RenderAmounts` exists to prevent.  The
    two maps come from :func:`transfer_settlement_amounts`, the popover's own
    producer, so the cell and the popover cannot disagree about the pair.

    Args:
        xfer: The transfer to render.  Owner-established by the caller -- see
            :func:`transfer_budgets`, which states what that does and does not
            guarantee.
        **extra: Forwarded to ``render_template`` -- ``wrap_div=True``,
            ``conflict=True``, ``error=<message>``, the flags each caller adds
            on top of the shared context.

    Returns:
        Rendered HTML string.

    amount maps the display reads (:class:`RenderAmounts`), the ``entry_sums``
    dict the progress indicator on tracked transactions needs, and the PAYDAY
    the due-date caption is compared against.

    **The caption is DECIDED by the route and drawn by the template**
    (pay-calendar plan step C4-a-1).  The partial computed it itself, as
    ``t.due_date != t.pay_period.start_date`` -- a lazy relationship load
    issued from inside the render, once per distinct paycheck on a page
    drawing N cells, and a template cannot be given a query budget.  Both
    surfaces that draw this cell now call the same producer
    (:func:`~app.services.grid_view_service.due_captions_by_key`), so a row
    cannot caption one way on the grid and another in the fragment the same
    click swaps in -- the rule :class:`RenderAmounts` above states for the
    three amount maps, applied to the fourth thing a cell draws.

    **The payday it needs is now this function's OWN load, and the count did
    not change** (plan step ``pay_calendar:C13-b``).  This paragraph used to
    say the read cost nothing here because every caller had already proved
    ownership through ``txn.pay_period.user_id``
    (``transactions/_helpers._get_owned_transaction`` and its siblings), so
    the relationship was loaded before this ran.  Those doors read
    ``txn.user_id`` now and hydrate nothing, so the reason is gone -- and the
    load is not: it MOVED here, as a lazy load, and that is the honest
    statement rather than either "still free" or "one statement worse".

    **Re-measured 2026-09-03 on ``GET /transactions/<id>/cell``, both
    spellings of the ownership door, same request:** 12 statements and 1
    ``PayPeriod`` hydration EITHER SIDE.  The only difference is WHERE the
    ``budget.pay_periods`` SELECT sits in the sequence -- fifth (the ownership
    walk) before, sixth (this due caption) after.  The 2026-08-27 measurement
    this paragraph quoted said 12 as well, so the number is unchanged and its
    reason is not.

    Deriving the owner's calendar here instead was built and rejected on the
    2026-08-27 measurement -- it ADDED two statements on top of the load the
    ownership check had already paid for, and bought only a re-check of an
    ownership fact the route had just established.  **The arithmetic behind
    that rejection has shifted and the conclusion has not**: it is now one
    lazy load against a two-query derivation, so the derivation is still the
    more expensive of the two.  ``start_date`` is the one column
    ``budget.pay_periods`` actually stores, carried through
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.derive_periods` untouched, so it is the
    same date the grid's derived window publishes.

    **The BALANCE LINE is the fifth thing the cell draws against** (plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-4-2``, ruling **R-CC16**): a row on another account
    than the balance line's carries an account chip, and since plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-5-2`` so does a row whose MOVEMENTS are -- the
    ``account_chips`` macro decides off ``t.account_id`` and each of
    ``t.entries``' against the ``account`` published here, the way the grid
    page's row macro publishes its own.  Resolved through
    :func:`fragment_balance_line`, the same call the transfer cell's arrow
    reads, and PUBLISHED even when it resolves ``None``: the partial reads it
    with ``is not none``, so a surface that forgets the key raises where a
    ``None`` draws no chip.  The chips' labels cost this fragment nothing
    beyond what it already paid: ``Transaction.account`` is
    ``lazy="joined"`` on the model, the family is loaded by
    :func:`fragment_amounts`'s settled-record read (17 statements for a
    bill's cell and 18 for an envelope's, one of them the family, on the
    tree before CC-5-2 and after it), and a movement's account is an

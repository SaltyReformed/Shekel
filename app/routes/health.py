Shekel Budget App -- Health Check Endpoint

Provides a lightweight health check for Docker HEALTHCHECK, load
balancers, and external monitoring.  Returns database connectivity
status as JSON.

This endpoint:
- Requires no authentication (external monitors must reach it).
- Is excluded from request logging (avoid noise from frequent checks).
- Is exempt from Flask-Limiter (Docker healthchecks fire from a single
  loopback IP every 30 seconds and would otherwise consume the per-IP
  budget that defends auth and mutating routes).  The exemption is
  enforced at the route level so it cannot be silently revoked by
  changing default_limits.
- Does not trigger audit log writes (SELECT 1 touches no audited tables).

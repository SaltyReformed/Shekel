Shekel Budget App -- Grid route package: what the page and its partials share.

What BOTH halves of this package share, and nothing else.  The budget grid
renders once as a full page (:mod:`~app.routes.grid.page`) and then re-renders
three fragments of itself on HTMX events (:mod:`~app.routes.grid.partials`) --
and the fragments must agree with the page they are replacing, figure for
figure.  These are the producers that make that agreement structural rather
than a claim two modules keep: :func:`_resolve_visible_window` is the ONE
answer to "which paychecks is this request looking at",
:func:`_build_grid_view` is the ONE seam call every surface reads its columns
from (ruling R-K), :func:`_accrual_row_label` is the ONE word all three
surfaces name the modelled-return row with (ruling R-AI / R-P), and
:func:`_resolve_low_balance_threshold` is the ONE cut-off the yellow balance
cells test against.

A helper used by exactly one half lives in that half instead; this module is
the intersection, not a junk drawer.

    **The one rule the page and its self-refresh fragments must not disagree
    about**, and the reason this module exists.  ``/grid`` renders a window;
    ``/grid/balance-row`` and ``/grid/subtotal-rows`` then recompute their
    summaries for *the same* window on a ``balanceChanged`` event.  If the two
    resolved it separately, a refresh could patch a footer that describes
    different paychecks from the columns above it -- and nothing on screen
    would say so, because both halves would render consistently within
    themselves.  Written twice, in both modules, until an adversarial design
    review of plan step **C2-f2b** pointed out that the step which created this
    module had extracted everything but the rule that needed it.

    Both period reads come off the pass's own calendar (that step), so a
    request resolves ONE derivation and reads the clock ONCE.

    Args:
        ctx: The read pass's :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`,
            which carries both the pinned ``as_of`` and the owner's calendar.
        num_periods: How many columns to show.  The CALLER supplies it, because
            the two differ legitimately: the page falls back to the owner's
            ``grid_default_periods`` setting and the fragments to a literal 6,
            the fragments' own URLs always carrying an explicit ``periods=``.
        start_offset: Columns to shift the window by, relative to the current
            paycheck.  A user-supplied query parameter, so a value below the
            schedule's start is ordinary; the window then comes back SHORT
            rather than re-based (:meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.window`).

    Returns:
        ``(current_period, window)``, or ``None`` when no SAVED paycheck covers
        the pass's ``as_of`` -- the state the page answers with
        ``no_periods.html`` and the fragments with ``204``.  Saved containment
        rather than :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.span_containing`
        is deliberate: every column is keyed by the id a transaction points at,

    figure the grid renders for it -- the projected end balance, the income /

    "Book vs bank", split at ruling R-DH (f)), and
    the two modelled tiers (the contribution and the accrual, rendered as their
    own conditional rows and labelled per kind by :func:`_accrual_row_label`).

    **One producer pass, not three** (plan step X-c2b1, finding N-48).  The

    twice (the visible window and the Plan window), building the live override
    map itself and threading it into all three -- and the invariant binding the
    balance row to the subtotal row was then a claim two producers had to keep
    true rather than a property of one row set.  Asking the seam once for the
    whole anchor-forward set and SLICING it per window is both cheaper and the
    shape ruling R-K's identity needs: measured on the prod-shape clone
    2026-07-26 (real Checking, 60 periods, 5 runs) the full render's producer
    work drops ``219.9 ms -> 127.6 ms``, the whole saving being the second
    override build this route no longer does.

    The grid keeps its own ``all_transactions`` query (in
    :func:`_load_grid_transactions`) for display purposes: the route needs the
    ``template`` eager-load for row-key generation and the same entries for
    ``entry_sums`` / cell rendering, neither of which is in the producer's
    remit.  It no longer builds its own live override map -- the view carries
    the one the projection was computed with (ruling R-Q), so a cell and the
    balance row cannot price the same row differently.

    Args:
        account: The grid account, or ``None`` for the user-with-zero-accounts
            edge case.
        balance_ctx: The read pass's
            :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`.  It carries the
            projection domain too since plan step C2-c: the seam reads the
            owner's whole pay calendar off it
            (``reported_periods()``) rather than taking a list of ORM rows,
            whose ``end_date`` and ``period_index`` are the two derived columns
            plan step C4 drops.  Every period is answered -- there is no
            anchor-forward restriction to respect since plan step X-c2b2 --
            and each is valued off its OWN span, so each render window is a
            slice of the result rather than a re-based projection.

        figure and the day it was true for, not part of the projection).
        No-account state returns the seam's empty view and ``None``, and the
        grid template renders empty cells cleanly.  **The header's figure and
        its "as of" caption come off ONE object** (rulings R-EH / R-EP): they
        were ``current_anchor_balance`` and ``updated_at``, two different facts
        -- the caption moved on any account edit and stopped moving entirely

# (``investment/dashboard.html``) and "appreciation" / "at 3.0%/yr"

# windows baked in rather than instances of one string, so this map is the
# canonical source for the GRID's row and not a fourth copy of any of them.
#
# It is TOTAL over ``AccountProjectionKind`` and subscripted, never ``.get``
# with a default: a kind added to the enum without a word here must fail at the
# render rather than label a new kind silently and wrongly, which is the same
# reason this codebase refuses a bare ``except``.  PLAIN and AMORTIZING can
# never reach the row -- neither resolves an ACCRUAL tier, so
# ``row_flags.accrual`` is False for both -- but they are members because the

# because a knowingly-wrong entry is the very thing the subscript above exists
# to prevent.  **AMORTIZING therefore reads "Interest", not the generic word:**
# a loan's accrual is interest CHARGED, and naming a liability's accrual after
# an asset's growth reads as the opposite of what it is.  PLAIN models no
# return at all, so no word is truthful for it and it carries the kind-neutral
# one -- which is also what a ``None`` account resolves to.

# INVESTMENT's row carries.  Those are two decisions, not one: "Growth" is the

# already renders.  Binding them together would let a later edit to the

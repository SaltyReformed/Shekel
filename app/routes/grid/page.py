# rather than a literal 6, and that is the point: it is deliberately the same
# span as the desktop selector's `6M` button, and naming the number once is
# what makes the two agree STRUCTURALLY.  A first draft wrote two literal
# sixes and asserted in a comment that they "cannot come to disagree", which
# is the agreement-by-sentence ledger row **F-17** is about.

# **It was `PLAN_WINDOW_PERIODS = 13` -- a pay-period COUNT -- until plan step

    after the mobile-follow-up Commit 8 / F-6 decomposition.

    **Every period here is DERIVED since plan step C2-f2b**, and ``user_id``

    **C4** needs before it can drop both columns.

        balance_ctx: The read pass's ``BalanceContext`` (scenario + as-of +

    A user with no baseline scenario is NOT handled here (plan step X-v2,

    and was the only surface in the app that did, while `/savings` fabricated a
    ``$0.00`` hero and three other pages returned a 500.  The raise comes from
    the caller's :func:`_load_grid_transactions`, which asks the context for
    the scenario id it scopes its query with; ONE application-level handler
    renders that same card, so every surface answers the state identically and
    this route states no policy about it.

    **Its ORDER against the no-periods answer changed with it**: a user missing
    both now sees ``no_periods.html``, where the deleted guard put the baseline
    card first.  Neither is a dead end (the card is one click from any balance
    page), and a user with no periods and no baseline needs both repairs.

    :func:`~app.routes.grid._shared._resolve_visible_window` the self-refresh
    fragments also call.  What that consolidated is the number of CLOCK READS,
    not the number of clocks: ``get_current_period`` defaulted to
    ``date.today()`` and ``BalanceContext.build`` defaults to the same, so the
    two agreed except across midnight, where one request could seat the current
    column in one paycheck and value the pass in another.  *The render still
    carries a second clock and this is not the step that unifies it*:
    ``today=display_today()`` below drives the past-column styling and the
    carry-forward button, and it is the DISPLAY day where ``as_of`` is the
    process day (ledger row **P49**, owned by ``C2-f3``).

    It is DETERMINISTIC now too: the retired reader's SQL carried no
    ``ORDER BY`` and took ``.first()`` (ledger row **P19**), so two rows
    covering one day -- expressible in the stored columns, unconstructible in
    the derivation -- returned whichever the planner reached first.

    Returns:

    cover :data:`PLAN_WINDOW_MONTHS` months of the OWNER's paychecks.

    **No entry sums or entry lists are computed, and that sentence became
    TRUE at pay-calendar plan step C4-a-3** -- Plan renders future periods
    read-only and envelope entries are by design a current / past concept.
    It stood here while :func:`_build_grid_row_data` built both maps over
    every loaded row on this call as well, and returned them into a
    ``row_data`` this function drops on the floor: the claim described the
    OUTPUT and the work was done anyway.  Both builds now live at
    :func:`index`, the one caller that renders them, which is also why this
    function no longer takes the ``budgets`` map it only ever forwarded.

    Args:
        ctx: The :class:`_GridContext` for this request.  Supplies
            ``current_period`` (the plan window's anchor) and, through
            ``balance_ctx``, the pass's own pay calendar -- the same memoized
            derivation the visible window was cut from, so Plan and This Period
            are two views of one schedule rather than two reads of the table.
        all_transactions: The list already loaded by
            :func:`_load_grid_transactions`.  Re-used here instead of
            re-querying; ``_build_grid_row_data`` filters by visible
            window internally so the same list works for the wider
            Plan window.
        grid_view: The :class:`~app.services.balance_at.GridBalanceView`
            produced by :func:`_build_grid_view`.  Its columns are SLICED to
            the plan periods -- never recomputed, which is what keeps the Plan
            recap and the This Period card two windows onto one projection
            rather than two projections.
        all_categories: User's full category set (active + archived).
            Forwarded to the row-key builder so archived-category
            transactions still render.

    Returns:
        Dict with six ``plan_*`` keys ready to splice into the
        ``render_template`` kwargs of :func:`index`:

          - ``plan_periods``: a
            :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PeriodWindow` starting at
            ``current_period`` and holding as many of the owner's paychecks as
            fall inside :data:`PLAN_WINDOW_MONTHS` months.  May be shorter when
            the user has fewer remaining generated periods.
          - ``plan_income_row_keys`` / ``plan_expense_row_keys``:
            row-key lists scoped to the plan window.
          - ``plan_matched_by_row_period``: same shape as the
            interactive ``matched_by_row_period`` -- keys are
            ``(category_id, template_id, txn_name, period_id)``.
          - ``plan_columns``: dict[period_id ->
            :class:`~app.services.balance_at.GridColumn`], the view's own
            columns for the plan window.
          - ``plan_row_flags``: the window's
            :class:`~app.services.balance_at.GridRowFlags` (ruling R-O's
            conditional-row rule, evaluated for THIS window rather than the

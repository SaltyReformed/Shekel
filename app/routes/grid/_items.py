"""
Shekel Budget App -- Grid route package: what the page DRAWS, and its prices.

The grid's window and the three per-cell amount maps over it, moved whole
out of :mod:`~app.routes.grid.page` at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-1`` (ruling
**R-BAL87**), the leaf that widened the window from one shape to two: the
cash-flow set's OWN plan rows, and one
:class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` per transfer the set shows,
read off ``budget.transfers`` rather than off a shadow row.  The page module
crossed pylint's 1000-line ceiling under that widening, and this is the
responsibility that grew -- so it is the one that moved, by the sibling-split
convention rather than by shaving prose.

Two producers and one value type: :func:`load_grid_items` answers "what
does this render draw" -- a :class:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.PlanItems`,
the shape every reader of the set's plan items answers since leaf
``X-bi-6-1b`` -- and :func:`build_amount_maps` answers "what does each
item's cell say its amount IS, what its money DID, and what a tick WOULD
book" -- each map holding both shapes under
:func:`~app.services.transfer_legs.cell_key`.  Only
:func:`~app.routes.grid.page.index` calls them; the partials read the balance
seam, not the window.

    **The rows are the PAYCHECK's across the set -- checking and its cards --
    not one account's** (developer ruling ``credit_card:R-CC16``, plan step
    CC-4-1), and since leaf ``X-bi-6-1`` (ruling **R-BAL87**) a transfer is
    not among them as a row at all: the set's OWN rows are loaded through
    :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.own_rows_clause` -- every member's
    plan rows, no shadow -- and each transfer the set touches is drawn as a
    :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` read off the parent in
    ``budget.transfers``, from the side
    :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.leg_accounts_shown` names (ruling
    ``credit_card:R-CC23``: once, from the balance line's side, when both
    endpoints are members).  It was ``Transaction.account_id == account.id``,
    then the paycheck-rows clause that dropped only the far leg; the two
    loads below keep both properties (a balance line outside the set is a set
    of one) and stop reading the shadow rows.  ``cash_flow=None`` (the
    user-with-zero-accounts edge case) omits the account filter and loads no
    legs, so the result is naturally empty.

    **Two statements where there was one, both windowed by the same period
    ids**: the rows' ``pay_period_id IN (...)`` here and the transfers' in
    :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.set_transfer_legs_in_periods`, the
    one period-windowed transfer load every display reader shares since
    leaf ``X-bi-6-1b``.  The legs' records (a settled leg's covering
    movement) are one more load inside it.

    ``all_periods`` is the pass's reported window, every member of which is
    MATERIALISED -- so ``period_id`` is never ``None`` and the ``IN`` clause
    cannot be silently scoped by a null.

    Eager-loads the rows' ``entries`` (for entry-sum rendering) and
    ``template`` (for row-key generation); the transfers carry their pricing
    chain, and their endpoints (a leg's label and account chip read them)
    are ``lazy="joined"`` -- all read in the row-data helper and the cell
    template, so the loads avoid per-item N+1 queries in the grid render
    loop.

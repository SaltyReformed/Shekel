"""
Shekel Budget App -- Why a submitted recurrence change may be REFUSED

The refusal half of :mod:`app.routes._recurrence_form_helpers`, split out at
plan step R7c-b when that module met the 1,000-line cap for the fourth time.
The seam is the one the module had already grown: everything here answers "may
this submission be applied at all", and everything there APPLIES one.  Each
refusal is a rule the form also expresses as an affordance -- a disabled
control, an unset ``<select>`` -- and disabling is never the guard, because a
client may post whatever it likes.

Four rules, and :func:`refuse_recurrence_update` asks them in the one order
they can be asked in:

1. a LOAN PAYMENT may not be made one-time
   (:data:`LOAN_PAYMENT_CANNOT_BE_ONE_TIME`);
2. a definition whose validity window the app DERIVES may not have one stated
   for it (:data:`LOAN_PAYMENT_BOUND_IS_DERIVED`);
3. a rule the form could not DISPLAY may not be cleared by the empty
   submission that state produces
   (:data:`UNREPAIRED_CADENCE_CANNOT_BE_CLEARED`);
4. no edit may leave the rule stopping before it starts
   (:func:`refuse_inverted_window`).

A FIFTH is asked later, by each door once its edit is applied, because it
grades the state the save would LEAVE rather than the submission: no edit may
leave a still-projected row of the definition answering an occurrence its
books drop, or inside the books of the account it sits on
(:func:`refuse_stranding_save`, plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``).

**:class:`RecurrenceFormContext` is DEFINED here**, one layer below the
authoring helpers that also take it, and that is what keeps the split a
boundary rather than a pair of modules that need each other.  Until plan step
R7d-f the two refusal entries took the closing bound and the redirect as bare
arguments, because the context lived in the authoring module and importing it
here would have closed a cycle; the inverted-window refusal then came to need
a THIRD value of the caller's -- the read pass -- and three bare copies of a
parameter object's fields is the shape the object exists to remove.  So the
leaf moved (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14's placement clause): the helpers import the
context from here, and every refusal reads it whole beside the pass.

Route-layer module rather than service because every refusal ``flash``es and
redirects (the latter via
:class:`~app.routes._redirect_target.RedirectTarget`);
``CLAUDE.md::Architecture`` keeps services isolated from Flask globals.  The
leading underscore marks the module as route-internal.

server can, from two facts it already holds: the stored rule names a pattern
this application does not model, and the submission names no cadence.  A form
that could not offer this rule's cadence cannot have collected the user's
intent to remove it, so the empty submission is refused rather than acted on.

"""Refusal shown when a submission states a bound the app DERIVES.

**The server half of a control the form renders disabled**, and it needs both
halves for the reason ``UNREPAIRED_CADENCE_CANNOT_BE_CLEARED`` does: disabling
is an affordance, and a client may post whatever it likes.

``loan_recurrence_sync`` owns BOTH of the loan's standing payment's validity
bounds, each in its own way since ruling **R-R29**: the OPENING bound is
WRITTEN -- the loan's first contractual installment, re-derived when the
loan's ``payment_day`` moves -- and the CLOSING bound is DERIVED, the loan's
payoff resolved through the composed door on every read and stored nowhere
(plan step R7d-g).  A start accepted here would be silently discarded by the
next such edit, which is worse than refusing it, and the OPENING half is
worse still: it is what keeps a payment from generating before the loan
originates, measured at $3,220.92 of phantom cash debits on a mortgage
closing one month out.  A stop accepted here would state a plan the loan
does not know about -- so the loan's own payment runs to the payoff and
archiving is the door to stop it early (ruling **R-R59**, developer
2026-09-05, taken at plan step R7d-f: the control stays locked).  Until R7d-g
it would also have been discarded by the next payoff-affecting edit, which
wrote the derived payoff over it.

**The CREATE door states the same rule for a definition that does not exist
yet** (plan step R7d-f-3, ruling **R-R60**):
``_loan_destination.settle_first_occurrence`` derives the opening
bound for any loan destination and flashes THIS sentence for a stop stated
where the loan holds no active payment -- the definition being created would
be that payment.  It reads "stated" as a real stop rather than as the key's
presence, because that form's server render cannot lock the control and emits
"Never" as its default; the reasoning is on
``_refuse_stop_on_a_new_loan_payment``.  **And the UPDATE door states it for
the two edits that make a definition a loan's recurring transfer** (plan step
R7d-f-4, plan ledger row **REC-521**): a cadence added to a one-time transfer
into a loan, or a repeating transfer moved onto one, through the same reading
(``_loan_destination.settle_destination_for_update``, rulings
**R-R76** and **R-R77**) -- ahead of :func:`refuse_recurrence_update`, whose
presence rule below is the standing payment's alone.

**Which definitions it fires for is :func:`bounds_are_the_loans` --
``balance_at.is_standing_loan_payment``, or its archived reading since plan
step R7d-g-2 -- not :func:`is_loan_payment`** (plan step R7b-4; read off the
pass since R7d-f).
Those are different questions and asking the second was a defect an
adversarial review of plan step R7b-3 found: a template can carry loan-payment
SETTINGS without being the loan's standing payment, and its form then locked a
control for a value nothing wrote.  See that predicate's docstring.

    A parameter object, not a single domain concept: it groups the three
    otherwise-independent knobs the helpers read so the verbatim-triplicated
    signature tail collapses to one argument (and ``resolve`` forwards it
    unchanged).

    Bundles the three inputs that
    :func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_helpers.recurrence_spec_from_form`,

    bound, the validation-error redirect target, and whether the submitting
    schema exposes ``due_day_of_month`` (transaction templates) or not
    (transfer templates).  Collapsing the formerly-triplicated
    ``end_bound`` / ``redirect_endpoint`` / ``redirect_endpoint_kwargs``
    / ``include_due_day_of_month`` signature tail into one object both
    removes the duplication and clears the per-helper

    **Defined in THIS module since plan step R7d-f**, having lived in the
    authoring helpers: the refusals read two of its fields and could not
    import it across the one-way seam, so they took those two as bare
    arguments until the inverted-window door needed the read pass beside
    them.  See the module docstring.

    **It does NOT carry the read pass**, and the omission is deliberate: the
    create preamble builds this context with no stored definition to read and
    no pass in hand, and a field half the constructors leave empty is an
    optional the other half must remember to check.  The pass is the UPDATE
    path's own argument (``pass_ctx``), passed beside this object by the two
    entries that judge a stored definition.

        end_bound: When the recurrence STOPS, as the ONE value the submission
            composed (:class:`~app.services.recurrence.EndBound`), or ``None``
            when the form STATED NOTHING about it.

            The two are different requests and the helpers act on them
            differently -- a stated bound REPLACES the rule's, an absent one
            leaves it alone -- which is the same present-versus-absent
            distinction ``recurrence_unit`` turns on, and it is what lets a
            form whose bound is derived (a loan payment) render the control
            disabled and have the save mean "not mine to state" rather than
            "ends never".  It carried the raw ``end_date`` until plan step
            R7b-3, where a date was the only bound a form could state and the

    SUBMISSION states; an update states at most one of them and keeps the
    stored other, so the pair the save would actually write is invisible to it.
    Two ordinary edits produce it and both were unhandled 500s:

    * clearing "Starts on" while setting an earlier "Ends on" -- the cleared
      date box drops the key, the stored start is kept, and the new bound lands
      below it;
    * moving "Starts on" PAST a stored ``end_date`` without touching the "Ends"

    constraint refuses the pair at the flush as an ``IntegrityError``, which
    is a 500 and not a sentence, so the door grades the same pair first and
    says so.  The CHECK was held back until R7d-g on a developer ruling
    (2026-08-15): the columns carried DERIVED loan-payment windows beside
    authored ones, and an empty derived window was a correct answer a
    constraint could not tell from a user's mistake.  Nothing derived is

    stored half is the owner's word for EVERY definition (plan step R7d-g), a
    second recurring transfer into a loan included, so it is graded as
    stated.  Until R7d-g it was read through the composed door's cache arm
    (ruling **R-R56**), because the loan's standing payment stored the
    chokepoints' payoff there and a loan cleared before its first installment
    stored an INVERTED pair through the sync's own production door; that arm
    is deleted with the writers, and the stored pair of a standing payment
    cannot invert (its closing bound is NULL, or an owner's stop the
    loan-params door refuses to move the start past).

    The stored rule is NOT resolved here, deliberately.  The comparison needs
    the two bound columns and the start, none of which decodes the cadence,
    so a rule whose stored pattern the application no longer models still
    reaches its repair save without this door raising on the way -- the same

    active one, so it is standing only where the loan holds none.  The first

    is the seam's standing payment the moment it is active there, so a door

    Asked of the producer directly rather than off a pass: a create resolves

    **Measured on a production clone 2026-08-14: neither live loan payment
    satisfies the first predicate** (transfer templates 2 "Mortgage" and 9
    "Van Payment" carry no settings row), so a refusal asking it alone left
    both of the developer's real loans clearable -- the developer ruling of
    that day made :data:`LOAN_PAYMENT_CANNOT_BE_ONE_TIME` ask the union, and
    ruling **R-R76** (plan step R7d-f-4) made the destination refusal ask the
    same one.  Three sites read it: that one-time refusal
    (:func:`refuse_recurrence_update`), the destination refusal
    (:func:`~app.routes._loan_destination.settle_destination_for_update`) and
    the edit form's lock affordance
    (:func:`~app.routes._loan_destination.loan_destination_locks_for_edit`),
    whose lists are EMPTY for a definition this names because every move of
    it is refused rather than derived.  Two inline spellings agreed until this
    function replaced them; a third would have been the place they parted.

    Cheapest half first: the settings row is a lazy one-to-one -- at most one
    primary-key query, and none once the identity map holds it -- where the
    standing identity resolves the loan (memoised on the pass, so a second
    read on the same pass is free).

    Args:
        template: The ``TransactionTemplate`` or ``TransferTemplate``.  A
            transaction template answers ``False`` on both halves, and so
            does a ``PaycheckLine`` (plan step salary:R15-c), which has
            neither a settings row nor a destination.
        pass_ctx: The read pass the route built, whose loan-resolution memo
            answers the standing identity.

    Returns:
        ``True`` when either identity holds.

    Every refusal :func:`resolve_recurrence_rule_for_update` makes, asked

    step R7c-b, when the inverted-window door made a fourth and pushed the
    dispatcher past pylint's ``too-many-return-statements``; decomposing is
    this project's answer to that count, never a disable, and it is the same
    move ``transfers.templates._settle_create_references`` records one module
    over.

    The four, in the one order they can be asked in -- each later one assumes
    the earlier ones passed:

    1. a LOAN PAYMENT may not be made one-time;
    2. a definition whose validity window the app DERIVES may not have one
       stated for it;
    3. a rule the form could not DISPLAY may not be cleared by the empty
       submission that state produces;
    4. no edit may leave the rule stopping before it starts.

    Args:
        template: The template being updated.  Read only; not mutated.
        data: The validated payload.  Read for PRESENCE before the delegated
            helpers pop the recurrence keys; not mutated.
        ctx: The form context: the submitted closing bound (``None`` when the
            form stated none) and where a refusal sends the user.
        pass_ctx: The read pass.  Read for ONE fact, whether *template*'s
            bounds are the loan's (:func:`bounds_are_the_loans` -- the
            standing payment of the loan it pays into, or an archived
            transfer that becomes it on unarchive),
            which two of the four rules turn on -- and read only when one of
            them can fire, because answering it resolves the loan.  Built by
            the route BEFORE any write, as
            the 2026-08-16 ruling has it (a producer below the route takes the
            pass and never builds one); regeneration afterwards builds its own,
            as a writer must.
        recurrence_submitted: Whether ``recurrence_unit`` is present at all,
            read by the caller before this runs because the two of them share
            it and a second ``in`` test is a second statement of "did the form
            mention the recurrence".

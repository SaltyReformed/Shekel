"""
Shekel Budget App -- What a page NAMED before the press

One translation, made identically by every door a page with withdrawal
captions posts to: the transaction popover's Save, Paid / Received, Delete and
Undo CC (``routes/transactions/mutations.py``), the transfer popover's Save and
Paid (``routes/transfers/mutations.py``), and the purchase list's X and edit
form (``routes/entries.py``).

**The act that takes a movement off the books asks what the owner was SHOWN**
(plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``, rulings **R-CC81** / **R-CC127**): the
bank lines the page's withdrawal captions named, or the ruling that lets a
button stay silent.  The popover posts those lines back as ``shown_lines`` --
EMPTY when its captions name none, and that emptiness is itself a statement:
*"A button with no warning sends nothing"*.  A request WITHOUT the field came
from a surface that renders no caption at all, and what that means is the
DOOR's to say: Mark Paid's is silence under ruling **R-CC56** for the owner's
one-click (the grid's cell and its phone card) and, for a companion's, a press
that may free no line (ruling **R-CC130**,
``routes.transactions._press._mark_paid_press``); every other door's is that
it named nothing.

**At the transaction and transfer doors only a full-edit popover posts the
field, so there its presence also says WHERE a refusal is answered**: a
popover's out-of-date press redraws the popover (ruling **R-CC128**), and any
other surface's refusal is its ordinary error.  The purchase list's doors
post it from the list itself and read only :attr:`Press.shown`: each answers
a refusal by drawing that list again as it is now
(``routes.entries._refused_entry_response``), but for a purchase or row that
is gone, which is "not found".

Pure: no Flask import, no session.  A route-tier helper because the facts it
reads are about the FORM, the shape of :mod:`app.routes._typed_figure`.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence occurrence preview

The read-only HTMX fragment that shows the next five pay periods a recurrence
would land in, and the helpers that build it.  The endpoint is deliberately
kind-agnostic -- both the transaction-template form and the transfer-template
form point their live preview at it (``_recurrence_fields.html``) -- so none of
this belongs inside the transaction-template CRUD module it used to live in.
``templates.preview_recurrence`` is now the route decorator and one call.

The preview reads request args and never writes: it RESOLVES the submitted
recurrence through the same producer a save resolves through
(:func:`app.services.recurrence.resolve`, reached through the composed door
:func:`app.services.recurring_definition.resolved_submission`), so what the
user is shown is what saving would produce.  Before plan step R2c-1 it built
the rule by hand and derived the ``Every N Periods`` phase inline, which is
exactly the kind of second copy of a derivation the seam exists to remove.

**It reads the DESTINATION too, since plan step R7d-f-2** (plan ledger row
**REC-515**).  A transfer into a loan stops when the loan does, and that stop
is derived rather than stored, so a preview that walked the submitted rule
alone listed occurrences past the loan's payoff whenever fewer than five
remained -- on the one surface whose contract is the sentence above.  The
transfer form's ``to_account_id`` rides on the request, is resolved through
the ownership gate (404 for a missing id and a foreign one alike, the house
rule), and the walk is narrowed by the same door every other reader of a loan
payment's schedule takes.  The transaction form has no destination control,
sends none, and is narrowed by nothing -- which is the door's own answer for
a definition that pays into no account.

**It stopped building a transient ROW at plan step R-F6.**  It used to author
the submission onto an unsaved ``RecurrenceRule`` and hand that to
``rule_occurrences``, which read it straight back into a spec -- a submission
turned into a fake row and back to answer a question about a schedule.  That
round-trip also stopped being expressible: a rule belongs to exactly one
definition (``ck_recurrence_rules_one_owner``) and the preview has none, since
the template it previews may not exist yet.

Route-layer module rather than service because these read ``request`` and
``current_user``; the leading underscore marks it route-internal.

    """Return an ISO date query argument, or ``None`` when it is unusable.

    ``date.fromisoformat`` raises ``ValueError`` on anything that is not an
    ISO date, and this endpoint reads its values straight from
    ``request.args`` -- so ``?end_date=garbage`` was an unhandled 500 for any
    signed-in user.  Found by a neutral review of plan step R4a, which had
    closed the OTHER four unvalidated arguments through
    :class:`~app.services.recurrence.RecurrenceResolutionError` and then
    claimed the whole class; a value parsed BEFORE the seam cannot be refused
    by it.

    An unparseable bound is treated as ABSENT rather than refused, and the
    asymmetry with the day / month / interval refusals is deliberate: those
    are values the rule would be SAVED with, so a wrong one must not be
    previewed as though it were fine.  A bound that is not a date is not a
    bound either form can submit -- ``<input type="date">`` and the
    Marshmallow schema both produce ISO or nothing -- so it is a hand-crafted
    query string, and the honest preview of "no parseable bound" is the
    unbounded rule.

    **Both bounds share this one parser since plan step R7b-4**, which gave
    the OPENING bound a control: two copies of "parse it or drop it" is the
    shape that leaves one of them missing a fix the other got.  An
    out-of-RANGE opening bound is a different question and is NOT answered
    here -- ``resolve`` refuses it for every caller, and this endpoint's

    unsaved :class:`~app.models.recurrence_rule.RecurrenceRule` that

    Takes the AXES the form authors rather than a pattern id (plan step
    R7b-2): the preview reads the same two controls the save posts, so neither
    can read one submission as a different cadence than the other.  Before that
    it took the closed-set id and decoded it here, which was one translation
    the form no longer needs -- and the ``ref`` row it fetched before plan step
    R2e-2 was written onto the transient rule's ``pattern`` relationship for a

    ``recurrence_end_mode`` / ``end_date`` / ``max_occurrences`` are read
    straight from ``request.args``; the two form schemas bound them, nothing
    bounds this endpoint, and it is reachable by anyone signed in.  Measured at
    R4a on the arguments of the day: ``?interval_n=0`` raised out of the
    authoring seam, ``?month_of_year=13`` raised ``ValueError`` from
    ``monthrange(year, 13)`` inside the matcher R4a deleted,
    ``?day_of_month=-5`` raised ``ValueError`` from ``date(y, m, -5)``, and
    ``?day_of_month=32`` / ``?month_of_year=99`` answered 200 with a silently
    clamped or modulo-wrapped date.  Catching the ONE exception the resolution
    seam raises answers all five, and keeps each bound stated once -- on the
    column and its mirror in :func:`app.services.recurrence.resolve` -- rather
    than a third time here.  The day and month args are gone with the columns
    they named (plan step R7c-b); ``nominal_day`` took their place and takes
    the same disposition, refused by ``RecurrenceSpec`` when the date leaves no
    such day open.

    **``starts_on`` is the one that showed the rule needs maintaining rather
    than merely restating.**  R7c-b deleted the anchor walk that
    ``_MAX_START_DATE_YEAR`` was derived from, so the bound went with it -- but
    the failure it prevented had a second route: past the saved horizon the
    calendar PROJECTS a paycheck by adding ``cadence_days`` to a start, and
    ``?starts_on=9999-12-31`` overflowed that addition with an
    ``OverflowError`` this handler does not catch.
    ``_resolution._require_authored_start_window`` restores the bound at the
    seam, on the window the whole application already agrees on, so the muted
    line below covers it again.

    The two DATE bounds are the exception, and it took a second review to
    see the first of them: they are parsed BEFORE the seam and so cannot be
    refused by it.
    :func:`_submitted_iso_date` handles it -- BOTH closing-bound dates, through
    one parser since plan step R7b-4 -- and the docstring there says why an
    unparseable bound is dropped rather than refused.  **The destination is
    the other exception, and it is REFUSED**: ``to_account_id`` names a row,
    so it goes through the ownership gate (:func:`_submitted_destination`)
    before the door sees it.

    Returns:
        The fragment markup, or a muted one-line explanation when there is
        nothing to preview.

    Raises:
        BaselineMissingError: The destination is a configured loan and the
            owner has no baseline scenario (ruling **R-R30**), from the seam's
            own guard on the way to the derived stop.  The application-level
            handler answers it -- and what the browser then shows is stated
            rather than implied: ``recurrence_form.js`` fetches this fragment
            with a plain ``fetch()`` and no ``HX-Request`` header, so
            ``_recovery_response`` answers the FULL recovery page at ``200``
            and the script swaps that page into the preview ``<div>``.  The
            state is the broken invariant finding **F-10** names (registration
            bootstraps a baseline and nothing deletes one), the owner's edit
            form already rendered the recovery page one request earlier for
            the loan's own payment, and a fragment-aware branch in the handler
            is that handler's change, not this route's.  Every definition

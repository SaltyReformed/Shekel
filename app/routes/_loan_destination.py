"""
Shekel Budget App -- What a LOAN Destination Decides at the Transfer Form's Doors

What a LOAN destination decides about a recurring transfer's validity bounds,
at BOTH of the generic transfer form's doors, and the form's affordance for
it:

* the CREATE door (:func:`settle_first_occurrence`; plan step R7c-b, rulings
  **R-R60** and **R-R74** at plan step R7d-f-3, re-cut under **R-R81** at
  plan step R7d-g-2): where the definition WOULD be the destination loan's
  standing payment -- no active recurring transfer into the loan is older
  than it, the seam's own reading -- its first occurrence is the loan's
  first contractual installment, derived into the payload, and a stated stop
  is refused; otherwise this is a SECOND transfer, whose start is its
  OWNER's -- required, and refused at or before the loan's origination --
  and whose stop is its owner's;
* the UPDATE door (:func:`settle_destination_for_update`; plan step R7d-f-4,
  rulings **R-R76** and **R-R77**): the same two branches for the two edits
  that make a definition a recurring transfer into a loan, and a loan
  payment cannot be pointed at another account at all
  (:data:`LOAN_PAYMENT_CANNOT_CHANGE_DESTINATION`);
* the form's lock affordance (:class:`LoanDestinationLocks`,
  :func:`loan_destination_locks` for the create form and, since plan step
  R7d-f-5, :func:`loan_destination_locks_for_edit` for the edit form; ruling
  **R-R79**): the ONE set of destination ids the transfer form ships so
  ``recurrence_form.js`` can lock both bound rows the moment a loan the
  definition would be standing in is chosen, computed from the producer the
  doors read so the browser decides no domain fact, and whether the
  destination may change at all;
* and, one module over, the entry helper every door calls once its write
  is flushed (:mod:`app.routes._standing_payment`; plan step R7d-g-2,
  ruling **R-R85**): the loan's standing payment -- whichever definition the
  seam names NOW -- has its start brought onto the loan's contract and its
  rows brought along.

The two doors share one derivation of the first occurrence
(:func:`settle_loan_start`), one reading of the standing identity
(:func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.would_be_standing_payment`)
and one refusal per branch (:func:`_refuse_stop_on_a_new_loan_payment`,
:func:`_refuse_start_before_origination`), so an edit cannot author what a
create refuses (plan ledger row **REC-521**).

**Until plan step R7d-g-2 the doors derived the start for EVERY loan
destination** (plan ledger row **D50**).  Measured on a production clone
2026-09-13: a ``$50``/mo sweep into the Van created that day was written
with the Van's 2023-03-22 start, and the create path generated five past
sweeps (2026-04-22 .. 08-22), ``$250.00`` that never happened, which the
summed tier priced into the Van's payoff.  Under **R-R81** the standing
payment's start is the contract's and a second transfer's is its owner's;
the derive-then-discard shape is gone with the branch that produced it.

**Split out of :mod:`app.routes._transfer_creation_helpers` at plan step
R7d-f-5** (developer ruling **R-R78**, 2026-09-12), where it had accumulated
since R7c-b beside the four transfer-creation helpers until that module stood
at pylint's 1,000-line cap with this leaf's per-edit producer still to land --
the shape ruling **R-R75** took for ``balance_at/_context.py``: a pure move
graded by AST, then the step.  Route-layer module (leading underscore =
route-internal) rather than a service because every door here consumes Flask
globals (``flash``, ``current_user``, the redirect through
:class:`~app.routes._redirect_target.RedirectTarget`);
``CLAUDE.md::Architecture`` keeps services isolated from Flask.  Nothing here
creates or mutates transfer shadow transactions -- the doors write into the
PAYLOAD and refuse, and the writes stay the route's -- so the transfer
invariants are unaffected.

existence is how ``recurring_transfer_query`` FINDS a loan's payment, so
re-pointing the rule's owner leaves the loan amortizing with nothing

moved row would carry the old loan's cached payoff (ruling **R-R56**) into a
column its new destination reads as the owner's word.  For a settings-carrying
payment the amount model prices the definition off the loan it pays into
(``cash_ledger._amount_source._loan_payment_cash``: a DERIVE-mode payment is
P&I plus escrow, which a savings destination cannot answer), so the moved row
would refuse on every read of its cash.  An adversarial review of this step
found the second half missing from the first cut, which asked the identity
alone.  The two real intents each have a door: archive it to stop paying this
loan, or create a payment for the other one.

    2026-08-15).  A loan's standing recurring payment's first occurrence is
    the loan's first contractual installment; the app writes it, so the

    gap the lock leaves.

    **It DERIVES before the rule is built rather than after**, which is the

    **R-R85**).

    **The refusal is here rather than in the schema, for the reason the update
    path's is in the route**: whether a start is required depends on the

    anything else must state one -- and a schema never learns which accounts
    are loans.  So
    ``TransferTemplateCreateSchema`` carries

      have landed in was the chokepoints' cache (plan ledger row **N-512**).

    since plan step R7d-g-2 (ruling **R-R81**) that question is the BRANCH's:

    every real stop it is handed.

    **What "stated" means HERE is a real stop -- a date or a count -- and not
    the key's presence**, which is the one place these doors read the wire
    differently from the standing payment's (developer ruling 2026-09-12,
    taken at R7d-f-3; ruling **R-R77** extends it to the update door).  The
    standing payment's locked control is server-disabled, so any key it
    receives is a crafted POST; the create form's server render cannot know
    the destination, so it emits the "Ends" select ENABLED with "Never"
    preselected, and an ordinary browser posts ``never`` unless the script's
    lock ran -- and an edit form whose definition is not the standing payment
    yet renders the control enabled for the same reason.  Refusing on
    presence would therefore make the script the control -- the thing R-R60
    demotes to an affordance -- and refuse an owner who chose nothing on a
    page rendered before the loan lost its payment.  A stated "Never" and an
    absent key author the same row here (``recurrence_spec_for_create`` reads
    an absent bound as unbounded, and the update door states ``NEVER_ENDS``
    for it under R-R77), the unbounded rule the loan's payment carries, so
    accepting both refuses nothing real.  The reason the edit door reads
    presence for the standing payment -- a posted START could be a stale echo
    of a derived date -- has no counterpart for a stop whose derived value is
    the constant ``NEVER_ENDS``.

    The inverted-window twin that stood beside this until plan step R7d-g-2
    (``_refuse_bound_before_derived_start``) went with the derive-for-every-

       **R-R76**, :data:`LOAN_PAYMENT_CANNOT_CHANGE_DESTINATION`): the loan's
       STANDING payment -- or, since plan step R7d-g-2, an archived transfer
       that becomes it on unarchive (ruling **R-R86**) -- or a definition
       carrying loan-payment settings: the union its twin refusal covers,
       spelled once for both and for the form's affordance as
       :func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.is_loan_payment_or_standing`
       (plan step R7d-f-5).  Asked first, and of the stored
       definition, because it is what makes every move settled below a move
       of a definition whose bounds are its OWNER's: the start rule 2
       derives cannot trip the presence refusal the edit door keeps for the
       standing payment (``refuse_recurrence_update``'s
       ``LOAN_PAYMENT_BOUND_IS_DERIVED`` arm reads ``starts_on``'s PRESENCE,
       and rule 2 writes that key).
    2. **The standing branch, where the definition WOULD be the standing
       payment of the loan the edit leaves it paying into** -- no active
       recurring transfer into that loan is OLDER than it, the seam's own
       reading (ruling **R-R81**; the developer chose the seam's reading over
       emptiness after this leaf's adversarial review, because an older
       definition moved onto a paid loan IS the seam's standing payment the
       moment it lands there, and a door that wrote its owner's start had
       the sync overwrite it in the same request): for the two
       edits that make the definition a recurring transfer into it -- adding
       a cadence to a definition that had none, or moving one that repeats
       onto it -- the first occurrence is DERIVED, whatever the payload said,
       exactly as at create.  Written into the payload, where both update
       branches read it: the authoring branch as the start it builds from,
       the re-point branch as a PRESENT key that replaces the stored date.  A
       partial submission that moves a recurring definition without restating
       its cadence is COMPLETED from the stored row
       (:func:`~app.services.recurrence.stored_cadence`) so the re-point
       branch runs and carries the derived start: "absent leaves the stored
       cadence alone" and "restate the stored cadence" are one request, and
       completing it is what keeps the derivation on one branch rather than
       giving this function a rule writer of its own.  A cadence the
       application cannot read cannot be completed, so that submission is
       refused with the form's own repair sentence

       cadence is :func:`_cadence_unit_to_settle`, asked only once the
       destination is known to be such a loan (an adversarial review of plan
       step R7d-f-4 found the first cut completing a partial move onto
       SAVINGS).  The closing bound is the create door's, one door over
       (ruling **R-R77**, developer 2026-09-12): a REAL stop this submission
       states -- a date or a count -- is refused, and where it states "Never"
       or NOTHING the write states the unbounded rule -- even where the moved
       definition stored a real stop.  That stop was the owner's word about a
       savings transfer, not about the loan, and the loan's own payment
       carries no stop (ruling **R-R59**); and a locked "Ends" row posts
       nothing, so "nothing" has to mean the unbounded rule for the
       affordance plan step R7d-f-5 adds to this form to be lockable at all.
    3. **The second-transfer branch, where that loan already holds an
       OLDER payment** (ruling **R-R81**, plan step R7d-g-2; until then this
       derived the start too, plan ledger row **D50**): nothing is derived.
       The start the edit leaves -- the submitted one, or the stored one an
       absent key leaves alone -- is the OWNER's and is refused at or before
       the loan's origination (:func:`_refuse_start_before_origination`); an
       authoring edit that states none is refused one step on, by the
       recurrence step's own "needs a start" sentence, exactly as for a
       savings destination.  The stop is the owner's on the update door's
       ordinary reading: a stated one replaces, an absent one leaves the
       stored one alone, and the schema has graded a submitted pair.

    Args:
        template: The definition being edited, owner-checked by the route.
            Read for its stored destination, rule, settings row and active
            flag; NOT mutated -- the field loop moves the column afterwards.
        data: The validated partial payload, mutated in place on the standing
            branch: the derived ``starts_on`` and ``nominal_day`` are
            written, and the stored cadence keys for a partial move (rule
            2).  Every FK in it must already be ownership-checked -- this
            reads the destination's loan parameters, so an unchecked id would
            be an IDOR.
        end_bound: The closing bound the submission composed, or ``None``
            when it stated nothing about it (the route lifted it out of
            *data* before this).
        pass_ctx: The read pass the route built BEFORE any write.  Rule 1's
            identity is read off its loan-resolution memo, which the refusals
            after this read again for free.
        redirect: Where a refusal sends the user (the edit form).

    Returns:
        ``(end_bound, refusal)``.  *end_bound* is the closing bound the write
        states: *end_bound* as given, or ``NEVER_ENDS`` where rule 2 makes
        the stop the loan's and the submission stated none.  *refusal* is

    The browser's half of the rules the two doors enforce, emitted by the

    rather than two context keys so the parts cannot be passed apart, and
    with the invariant below enforced rather than documented.

    **Emitted by BOTH transfer forms since plan step R7d-f-5** (ruling
    **R-R79**).  A CREATE form's server render cannot lock either bound row --
    the destination is chosen in the form -- which is why the set rides to
    the browser at all.  An EDIT form knows its template: it locks both rows
    server-side where the definition's bounds are the loan's
    (:class:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_render.RecurrenceStart`,
    :class:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_render.RecurrenceEnd`), and it
    emits this set COMPUTED FOR THAT EDIT
    (:func:`loan_destination_locks_for_edit`), because the update door derives
    the same bounds for the two edits that make a definition a loan's
    standing payment (:func:`settle_destination_for_update`) and the
    form otherwise invited a start the save replaces and a stop the save
    refuses.  The server answers the STORED identity, the script answers the
    CHOSEN destination against a set the server graded, and the script never
    re-enables a control the server locked (it reads ``disabled`` once at
    load and leaves that flag alone) -- the two never answer one question.

    **ONE set since plan step R7d-g-2** (ruling **R-R81**), where it carried
    two: every configured loan for the "Starts on" row and the payment-less
    subset for "Ends".  The doors derived the start for EVERY loan destination
    then (plan ledger row **D50**); a second transfer's start is its owner's
    now, so the two rows lock on the same membership and the wider set named
    a lock the door no longer applies.

        derived_for: The destinations a transfer into which BECOMES the
            loan's standing payment: the owner's configured loans holding no

            (:func:`~app.routes._recurrence_form_refusals.would_be_standing_payment`).
            Both bound rows lock the moment one is chosen -- the first
            occurrence is derived from the loan's contract
            (:func:`settle_loan_start`) and the loan's own payment carries no
            authored stop (ruling **R-R59**), so the doors refuse a stop
            stated anyway (rulings **R-R60**, **R-R77**).  A loan already
            holding an older payment is NOT here: a second transfer's start

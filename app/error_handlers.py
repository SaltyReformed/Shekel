Shekel Budget App -- application-level error handlers.

Every response the application produces for a condition no single route owns:
the five HTTP error pages, and the ONE answer to a user with no baseline
scenario (plan step X-v, ruling R-BW).

**Its own module because the factory has a line ceiling and this is a
concern, not plumbing.**  ``app/__init__.py`` already extracted its Jinja
filters to :mod:`app.jinja_filters` for exactly that reason; the
``BaselineMissingError`` handler is what pushed the factory over 1,000 lines,
and a registration helper that renders six responses is not the app factory's
job.  ``create_app`` calls :func:`register_error_handlers` and owns nothing
about what any of them says.

    whatever target the request named, so both facts about the response are
    decided by what the request was rather than by which state was found.

      cell because a refresh happened to run is worse than showing nothing.

        THE no-baseline policy (plan step X-v, ruling R-BW).  Every balance the
        app produces is scoped to a baseline scenario, so a user without one has
        no balance any surface can answer.  Before this, each surface that could
        reach that state decided for itself, and between them they decided
        several different things -- a full-page recovery card, a ``204``, a 404,
        a blank cockpit reporting a fabricated ``$0.00`` net worth, an anchor
        cache column presented as a current balance, a balance sheet asserting
        ``in_balance`` over a ledger it could not read, a hidden chip, and three
        surfaces that raised into a 500.  Plan step X-v's own entry carries the
        census; this is the one answer that replaced them:

        * **A SAFE-method HTMX request gets 204 No Content**, which is the
          contract the grid's self-refresh partials already shipped: an
          idempotent poll must leave the live DOM alone, never swap a setup card
          into a balance cell.
        * **A MUTATING HTMX request gets the card**, because 204 there means the
          user pressed a button and nothing happened, silently and forever --
          measured on ``POST /debt-strategy/calculate``, which answered ``204``
          with an empty body until X-v2's adversarial review caught it.  The
          card swapping into the results target says why the action did nothing
          and offers the repair.
        * **Everything else gets the recovery page.**

        **Status ``200``, and the reason is htmx, not precedent.**  htmx swaps
        only 2xx responses, so any honest-looking 4xx/5xx would make the two
        HTMX branches above render NOTHING -- the silence they exist to fix.
        The response is also a complete, actionable page rather than a failure
        the browser should surface as one.  What carries the failure signal is
        the ERROR event below, which is the channel an operator alerts on; a
        status code that no client acts on is not.

        **It is quiet on screen and LOUD in the log.**  No code path produces a
        baseline-less owner -- registration writes one, nothing deletes or
        un-baselines one, no path promotes a companion (measured 2026-07-28,
        and asserted by ``scripts/integrity_check`` DC-08) -- so an occurrence
        is either data changed outside the application or a caller resolving a
        context for the WRONG user.  The event carries BOTH ids for exactly that
        second case: ``user_id`` is who asked, ``context_user_id`` is who the
        raise was resolved for, and they differ only when a caller has the wrong
        one.  Logging only the requester would have made the event blind in the
        one failure it exists to diagnose (X-v2's adversarial design review).

        **Plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-b-2``, and it is the deferral ledger row
        P35 recorded rather than a new idea.**  That row weighed a
        ``BaselineMissingError``-shaped handler and deferred it to the owner of
        the step that would delete the fallback; this is that step, and the
        developer ruled on 2026-09-01 that the handler ships with it rather
        than being filed again.

        Until now ``PayCalendarError`` had no arm at all, so it reached the
        browser through the bare ``500`` handler: an unstyled page on a money
        screen, and inside an htmx fragment something worse -- htmx does not
        swap a 500, so a click did nothing and said nothing.  Fourteen raise
        sites across ``pay_calendar`` and ``paycheck_calculator`` shared that
        answer (AST census 2026-09-01; a grep over-counts, because the class's
        own docstrings name it).

        **Two states reach it and the page deliberately does not distinguish
        them.**  One is ordinary and repairable -- an owner with no
        ``budget.pay_schedule`` row, which since ``fk_pay_periods_schedule``
        means an owner with no paydays: a companion, or anyone before their
        first batch.  The other is a broken invariant no write door produces, a
        payday set that cannot define a calendar.  The OWNER can act on the
        first and can do nothing about the second, and both leave every
        per-period figure unanswerable, so the page offers the one repair that
        exists and the LOG carries which state it was.  That is the same split
        the no-baseline handler makes: quiet on screen, loud in the log.

        **This does not silence the invariant.**  ``PayCalendarError`` is still
        raised, still an ``ERROR`` event, and still names the path and the
        message that says which state fired.  What changed is that the user
        gets a page instead of a stack trace, and a fragment gets something
        rather than nothing.

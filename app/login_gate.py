Shekel Budget App -- The login gate: every request is refused unless declared

**An anonymous visitor reaches the endpoints named in :data:`PUBLIC_ENDPOINTS`
and nothing else.**  One ``before_request`` hook decides it for the whole
application, so a route is protected by EXISTING rather than by remembering a
decorator: there is no ``@login_required`` in ``app/`` any more, and a view
that wants to be reachable without a session says so HERE, by name, where a
reviewer reads the entire policy in one frozenset.

**Why a gate and not 213 decorators** (plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-4``,
finding **N-402**, developer ruling **bank_import:R-BI4**).  The decorator
model made "which routes are protected" a property that had to be re-stated
on every view and then RE-COUNTED by a hand-maintained sweep,
``tests/test_routes/test_auth_required.py``, whose own docstring said a new
route "must be added" to its list.  Censused 2026-09-11: the application
served 222 ``(method, rule)`` pairs, 213 of them decorated, and the sweep
listed 124 -- it had drifted by 89 pairs with every check green, because a
gate whose coverage is a list somebody remembers to update reports clean over
exactly what it cannot see.  Every decorator was in fact present, so the
behaviour was right and only the PROOF was missing; this module makes the
proof unnecessary by making the defect unrepresentable.  A route added a year
from now is gated without its author knowing this module exists.

**It is Flask-Login's own ``login_required``, hoisted** -- the same three
tests in the same order, calling the same
:meth:`~flask_login.LoginManager.unauthorized`, so the redirect, the flashed
sentence and the ``next`` parameter are exactly what every view produced
before.  ``OPTIONS`` is exempt because the decorator exempted it
(:data:`flask_login.config.EXEMPT_METHODS`, read from the library rather than
re-spelled), and ``LOGIN_DISABLED`` switches the gate off because it switched
the decorator off -- a throwaway app whose subject is an error page or a rate
ceiling sets it, and no shipped configuration does.

**Where it differs, deliberately: a URL that matches NO route is refused
too.**  The decorator lived on the view, so an anonymous request for a path
Werkzeug could not match -- a typo, or a POST-only door hit with GET -- was
answered by Flask's own 404 or 405 before any view ran, and an anonymous
prober could tell which paths exist by the status code.  A gate keyed on the
endpoint sees that request as ``endpoint is None``, which is not a declared
public endpoint, and bounces it to the login page like every other.  The
developer chose the fail-closed reading on 2026-09-11; an authenticated user
still gets the 404 or 405.

**Where it sits.**  Registered AFTER ``csrf`` and ``limiter`` bind their own
``before_request`` hooks, which is the part of the order that carries
behaviour: an anonymous POST with no token still meets the CSRF refusal
first, and an anonymous flood on a route is still counted against the rate
ceiling before it is bounced, exactly as when the check ran inside the view
(a flood on NO route is limiter-exempt, as it was when Flask answered 404).
It
also sits BEFORE the session-activity stamp, and that half is a pin rather
than a safeguard: the stamp writes only for an authenticated session, so
nothing would differ if the gate followed it -- when the check lived on the
view it DID follow it, the view being dispatched after every hook.  The
order is pinned so that it is one thing, in
``tests/test_routes/test_auth_required.py``.

#: Every endpoint an anonymous visitor may reach, by ENDPOINT NAME -- the
#: whole of the policy.  Keyed by endpoint rather than by path for the reason
#: the baseline sweep excludes Flask's static route by endpoint: a path prefix
#: also swallows every future path that happens to start the same way, and
#: a name either resolves in the route table or it does not.
#:
#: The seven views are the front door and what it needs: the login and
#: registration forms with their POSTs, the second factor's verify page (its
#: visitor has a password accepted and no session yet, which is the one state
#: between anonymous and authenticated this application has), the container
#: health probe, and the two PWA files a browser fetches before any session
#: exists.  ``static`` is Flask's own: the login page's CSS and JS.
#:
#: **Adding a name here is the only way to open a route**, and
#: ``tests/test_routes/test_auth_required.py`` pins this set's exact
#: contents, so an addition is a visible diff in two files and never a quiet
#: one -- and asserts every name resolves, so a renamed view cannot leave a
#: stale entry exempting nothing.

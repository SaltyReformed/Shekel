"""
Shekel Budget App -- Companion Service

Data access layer for the companion view.  Answers only the linked owner's
transactions a companion may see -- those whose
``Transaction.visible_to_companion`` is True -- for one pay period.

This is the security boundary for all companion data access.  Every
function validates that the requesting user is a companion with a
valid ``linked_owner_id`` before touching any owner data.

**``get_companion_periods`` was DELETED at plan step C2-f2b.**  It answered
"every pay period of the companion's linked owner", built for a period-nav
``<select>`` that ``companion/index.html`` now renders from its own prev / next
links, and an AST census that day found it with ZERO callers in ``app/`` -- so
it was a live ``get_all_periods`` reader that no request could reach.  Stated
here rather than silently dropped because its tests went with it.

Architecture:
  - No Flask imports.  Receives plain data, and returns ORM transactions
    inside a :class:`CompanionPageRead` whose three period fields are
    ``pay_calendar`` VALUE objects (plan step C2-f2b), or raises.
  - Flushes to the session but does NOT commit.  The caller owns the
    database transaction boundary.

    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for` memoizes nothing, so a
    return of the period alone would have the route derive that whole calendar
    a second time to answer the other two.

    **So this carries the ANSWERS and not the calendar that produced them**,
    which an adversarial design review of plan step C2-f2b corrected: a first
    cut returned the ``PayCalendar`` itself, and its only consumer was one
    route helper asking exactly these two searches.  Handing a whole schedule
    across this module's security boundary so a presentation layer can search
    it is the shape the arc already refused once, when ruling **R-PC19** ("How
    the CONTRIBUTION tier learns its periods") rejected an OWNER value riding
    on a per-account record.  The neighbours are computed here, beside the
    validation that decided whose calendar it is.

    Attributes:
        transactions: The companion-visible rows in :attr:`period`, with
            ``entries`` and ``template`` eager-loaded.
        period: The paycheck on screen.  Its ``period_id`` is never ``None``
            -- both branches that produce it answer SAVED periods only.
        previous: The paycheck opening before :attr:`period`, or ``None`` at
            the head of the saved schedule -- which is what hides the back link.
        next_period: The paycheck opening after it, or ``None`` at the tail.

    Loads the linked owner's live rows for the period in the baseline
    scenario and keeps those whose :attr:`Transaction.visible_to_companion`
    answers True -- a template-generated row by its definition's flag, an
    ad-hoc row by its own.  Eager-loads entries for progress computation.

    **The visibility rule is asked of each row, never restated in SQL**
    (plan step ``balance:X-bi-1b``, ruling **R-BAL19**, finding
    **BAL-482**).  This query carried ``TransactionTemplate.companion_visible
    OR (template_id IS NULL AND Transaction.companion_visible)`` -- the
    property's resolution rule spelled a second time, in another language,
    on the predicate that decides what a companion may see -- and it was the
    one reader that kept the row's ``companion_visible`` cell a public
    column when ``is_envelope`` was sealed at X-bi-1.  The clause is gone,
    the cell is sealed, and a query keyed on either name refuses to build;
    what a companion sees is decided in exactly one place, the same one
    ``auth_helpers.get_accessible_transaction`` asks.  The cost is loading
    the rows the filter drops: measured 2026-09-12 on a production restore,
    the baseline scenario's 951 live rows across its 64 saved paychecks are
    what the 64 companion pages load, 232 of them are shown, and the 719
    dropped carry 5 purchase entries between them.

    Defense-in-depth: verifies the user is a companion with a valid
    ``linked_owner_id`` before querying.

    **The period comes off the OWNER's pay calendar since plan step C2-f2b**,
    which is what let the companion page and the owner's mobile grid keep
    sharing ``grid/_mobile_this_period.html``: that partial reads a period's
    identity, and once the grid's periods became
    :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` values a partial serving
    both an ORM row and a derived one would have been the two-types-in-one-
    template shape the ``C2-f`` decomposition ruling exists to refuse.

    **It also makes the cross-owner refusal STRUCTURAL.**  This function
    resolved the submitted id with ``db.session.get(PayPeriod, ...)`` and then
    compared ``period.user_id`` against the linked owner -- the security
    boundary this module's docstring claims, written out by hand in one place.
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.period_by_id` searches ONE
    owner's calendar, so a period belonging to anyone else is absent rather
    than rejected and the comparison no longer exists to be dropped by a later
    edit.  ``NotFoundError`` still carries one message for both "no such
    period" and "not yours", which is the project's security response rule.

    Args:
        companion_user_id: The companion user's ID.
        period_id: Optional period filter.  If None, returns the
            current period's transactions.

    Returns:
        The :class:`CompanionPageRead` -- the rows, the paycheck they sit in,
        and the paychecks either side of it for the page's navigation.  The
        period's ``period_id`` is never ``None``:
        :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.period_by_id` answers
        only saved periods, and the containment search below is the SAVED one,
        so no projected span can reach the transaction filter.

    Raises:
        NotFoundError: User is not a companion, has no linked owner,
            period not found, or period belongs to a different owner.
        PayCalendarError: The owner's paydays cannot define a calendar.  *The
            practical route was a cadence outside 1..365 inferred for an owner
            with no ``budget.pay_schedule`` row (plan findings **P8** /

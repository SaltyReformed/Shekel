"""
Shekel Budget App -- Companion Service

Data access layer for the companion view.  Provides visibility-filtered
queries that return only the linked owner's transactions from templates
marked ``companion_visible=True``.

This is the security boundary for all companion data access.  Every
function validates that the requesting user is a companion with a
valid ``linked_owner_id`` before touching any owner data.

**``get_companion_periods`` was DELETED at plan step C2-f2b.**  It answered
"every pay period of the companion's linked owner", built for a period-nav
``<select>`` that ``companion/index.html`` now renders from its own prev / next
links, and an AST census that day found it with ZERO callers in ``app/`` -- so
it was a live ``get_all_periods`` reader that no request could reach.  Stated
here rather than silently dropped because its tests went with it.

Architecture:
  - No Flask imports.  Receives plain data, and returns ORM transactions
    inside a :class:`CompanionPageRead` whose three period fields are
    ``pay_calendar`` VALUE objects (plan step C2-f2b), or raises.
  - Flushes to the session but does NOT commit.  The caller owns the
    database transaction boundary.

    What :func:`get_visible_transactions` answers.  The companion page asks the

    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for` memoizes nothing, so a
    return of the period alone would have the route derive that whole calendar
    a second time to answer the other two.

    **So this carries the ANSWERS and not the calendar that produced them**,
    which an adversarial design review of plan step C2-f2b corrected: a first
    cut returned the ``PayCalendar`` itself, and its only consumer was one
    route helper asking exactly these two searches.  Handing a whole schedule
    across this module's security boundary so a presentation layer can search
    it is the shape the arc already refused once, when the ruling "How the
    CONTRIBUTION tier learns its periods" rejected an OWNER value riding on a
    per-account record.  The neighbours are computed here, beside the
    validation that decided whose calendar it is.

    Attributes:
        transactions: The companion-visible rows in :attr:`period`, with
            ``entries`` and ``template`` eager-loaded.
        period: The paycheck on screen.  Its ``period_id`` is never ``None``
            -- both branches that produce it answer SAVED periods only.
        previous: The paycheck opening before :attr:`period`, or ``None`` at
            the head of the saved schedule -- which is what hides the back link.
        next_period: The paycheck opening after it, or ``None`` at the tail.

    **The period comes off the OWNER's pay calendar since plan step C2-f2b**,

    **It also makes the cross-owner refusal STRUCTURAL.**  This function
    resolved the submitted id with ``db.session.get(PayPeriod, ...)`` and then
    compared ``period.user_id`` against the linked owner -- the security
    boundary this module's docstring claims, written out by hand in one place.
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.period_by_id` searches ONE

        period_id: Optional period filter.  If None, returns the

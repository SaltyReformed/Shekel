"""
Shekel Budget App -- Paycheck engine: the four TAXES, priced from a pay stub.

**A paycheck's taxes are its pay stub's, corrected by the formulas** (plan
step **salary:S11-c-2c**; rulings **R-SAL42**, **R-SAL54**, **R-SAL55**,
**R-SAL58**, **R-SAL77**, **R-SAL100**; closes ledger row **SAL-565**).  The
latest switched-on stub dated on or before the paycheck with the SAME LINES
prices it; with none, the latest switched-on stub on or before it of ANY
lines; with none at all, the formulas alone (:func:`priced_taxes`).  Each of
the four taxes is then the stub's own figure plus what the app's formulas
(:func:`~._withholding._bracket_tax_lines`) say changed between the stub's
paycheck and this one, floored at ``$0.00`` -- so a paycheck with the stub's
lines and the stub's pay lands on the stub, and a raise, a new tax year or a
line's new amount moves it by what the formulas price that change at.

Until this step one dated stub's four EFFECTIVE RATES priced every paycheck,
past and future, whatever its lines (``calibration_service``).  A third
paycheck in a month skips the Section 125 lines, so it took a normal
paycheck's Social Security and Medicare rates -- which carry those lines'
reduction -- on a base with nothing excluded, and was projected high (ledger
row **SAL-565**, measured on a production clone; the figure stays outside the
repository).  A stub of its own lines now prices it.

**How each side is priced** (the formulas run twice, on two paychecks):

* the PAYCHECK -- its gross, its pre-tax lines, the year-to-date before its
  payday, the rhythm in force on it, and its own tax year's law;
* the STUB's paycheck -- the stub's base pay plus the earnings it records as
  taxable, less the lines it records as pre-tax, each by the kind THE STUB
  prints it under and never the line's current kind (**R-SAL58**), with the
  year-to-date and the rhythm in force on the STUB's payday and the law of
  the stub's own tax year (**R-SAL77**: a December stub prices a January
  paycheck through both years' tables, so a new year's law reaches every
  estimate).  The year-to-date is the app's own replay of the year's earlier
  paychecks, the figure the formulas price the paycheck side with.

The W-4 entries, filing status and state are TODAY's on both sides (ruling
**R-SAL101**): the app keeps no dated history of them yet, so a change made
after the latest stub cancels out until a stub paid under it is entered
(plan step ``S16`` dates them; finding **SAL-591**).  The formulas charge
FICA on the gross, so a pre-tax line the employer exempts from FICA is
priced alike on both sides and cancels on a same-lines stub while both
paychecks sit below the Social Security wage base; it errs on an
other-lines stub (**R-SAL54**'s accepted cost) until plan step ``S11-e``.

**Around the wage base it errs further, and that is ledger row SAL-595.**
The stub's side is priced at the APP's year-to-date, so where the app and
the employer disagree about whether the stub's paycheck had reached the
base -- the app counting a FICA-exempt line toward it, or the employer
counting wages the app never saw -- the stub's whole Social Security
figure, or its absence, is carried into every paycheck it prices, the next
year's included, until a stub of the new year is entered.  The Medicare
surtax threshold shares it.  It moves ``$0.00`` for pay that never reaches
the base, and ``S11-e`` owns the row.

**A worker Social Security does not cover is ledger row SAL-596** (owner
``S11-e``, beside SAL-595).  The formulas always charge 6.2%, so a stub that
prints ``$0.00`` Social Security prices every later paycheck at 6.2% of its
pay above the stub's (``0.00 + formulas(paycheck) - formulas(stub)``, floored),
and every paycheck before the first stub at the full 6.2%, where the deleted
calibration priced ``$0.00``.  It moves ``$0.00`` for a worker the tax covers.

**What "the same lines" means, decided here** (applications of
**balance:R-BAL207**, the developer's standing rule that behaviour he cannot
see is decided by the best from-scratch design): a stub has the paycheck's
lines when the TAXED lines it records at a NON-ZERO amount -- its taxable
earnings and pre-tax deductions, each by the kind the stub records it under
(:data:`TAXED_KINDS`) -- are exactly the ones the engine prices at a non-zero
amount that payday, and it records no one-off of those kinds carrying money
(:func:`_has_the_lines`, through ONE filter, :func:`_taxed`, on all three).
The one-off half is ruling **R-SAL123** ("Only tax-changing one-offs",
amending R-SAL42 fork 8b and R-SAL54's reading, :func:`one_offs_change_taxes`):
a one-off of a taxed kind still makes a stub one of other lines, and one that
changes no tax -- an after-tax reimbursement, a post-tax deduction -- does not,
so it no longer sends the picker to an older stub.  Only those two kinds for
the paycheck lines too (an application of R-BAL207), because the question is whether
the stub's taxes describe this paycheck and no tax formula reads a post-tax
deduction or an after-tax earning: comparing them too would pass over a
newer stub that differs only in such a line for an older one, losing what
the newer stub's taxes reflect (the leaf's review, LOW-3; narrowed by the
coordinator under R-BAL207, 2026-10-05).  Only NON-ZERO amounts, because a
line worth ``$0.00`` moves no tax on either side, and the engine prices a
line its annual cap has used up at ``$0.00`` where no stub prints it, so
comparing the recorded keys alone would pass over a correct same-lines stub
for one of other lines at exactly the paycheck a cap runs out.

**One producer of what a stub adds up to.**  :func:`stub_totals` sums a
stub's figures by the kind each records and runs the waterfall the engine's
paycheck runs (:func:`~._breakdown.waterfall_gross`,
:func:`~._breakdown.waterfall_net`); the entry door's checks
(:func:`app.services.pay_stub_service.totals_of`) read it too, so the gross
the door checked is the gross the formulas price.  It lives here because the
door's module imports the engine and the engine may not import it back.

Imports :mod:`._breakdown`, :mod:`._calendar_questions` and
:mod:`._withholding`.  :mod:`._pricing` composes it, and the package
re-exports the names a caller outside it reads (:class:`StubTotals`,
:func:`stub_totals`, :func:`tax_years_for`, :func:`one_offs_change_taxes`).

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Paycheck engine: the tax FORMULAS, the four withholding lines.

The per-paycheck wage figures the formulas read (:class:`_WageBasis`) and the
formulas themselves, :func:`_bracket_tax_lines`: IRS Pub 15-T federal
withholding (:func:`_bracket_federal`) plus the annualised state tax
(:func:`_bracket_state`) plus FICA, the Social Security wage-base cap enforced
from the year-to-date cumulative the wage figures carry (CRIT-03 / F-037).

**Since plan step salary:S11-c-2c the formulas are one path, and a pay stub is
the other** (rulings **R-SAL42**, **R-SAL54**, **R-SAL55**): :mod:`._stubs`
runs these formulas twice -- on the paycheck and on the stub that prices it --
and adds their difference to the stub's own four taxes.  Until then this leaf
also held a calibrated path, one stub's four EFFECTIVE RATES applied to every
paycheck (``_calibrated_tax_lines``, through ``calibration_service``), and a
``_tax_lines`` that picked between the two; both went with the rates.

Split out of the one-module engine at plan step **salary:C12** (ledger row
**P64**).  Imports :mod:`._breakdown` and the tax services below the engine,
and nothing else of the package.

    """The per-paycheck wage figures withholding is computed from.

    The three wage figures travel together through the formulas: the period
    gross, the period taxable amount (gross less pre-tax deductions, floored
    at zero), and the year-to-date cumulative gross that drives the FICA
    Social Security wage-base cap.  The fourth field is the count the
    formulas annualise them by, which is a fact of the same paycheck.  Since
    plan step **salary:S11-c-2c** a pay stub's own paycheck is one of these
    too (:mod:`._stubs`): the stub's gross and taxable by the kinds it
    records, the year-to-date and the count in force on ITS payday.

        gross_biweekly: The period gross.

            **R-SAL66**; ledger row **SAL-569**): it was the basis's
            ``periods_per_year``, the LATEST era's count, so a paycheck paid
            under an earlier rhythm was annualised at a count it was never
            paid at.  It arrives from
            :meth:`~app.services.payroll_basis.PayrollBasis.base_pay_on`, the
            read that prices the same paycheck's salary at that rhythm, so the

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Paycheck engine: PRICING one paycheck, and a list of them.

The two public entries: :func:`calculate_paycheck`, which prices ONE
paycheck by composing the other leaves in the order its own numbered steps
name -- the payday's base pay off the basis (the per-paycheck rate its pay
list walks to, and the paychecks a year its rhythm pays), the
taxable earning lines and the gross they make, the deduction
passes, the after-tax earning lines, the four taxes (from the paycheck's pay
stub, or the formulas alone: :mod:`._stubs`), the net -- and
:func:`project_salary`, the batch over a period list that is nothing but a
loop over the first with the tax configs resolved per period year.

Split out of the one-module engine at plan step **salary:C12** (ledger row
**P64**).  This is the leaf that imports every other one; nothing else in
the package imports it.  The public names are re-exported by the package,
which is the door every caller uses.

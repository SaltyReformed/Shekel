"""
Shekel Budget App -- What ONE row is worth, without asking any producer.

The pure half of the cash valuation: the arms that answer from the row itself
-- a status that excludes it, a soft delete, the SETTLEMENT it recorded, and
the figure the row OWNS.  Nothing here consults the amount model's live
producers, which is the whole reason it is a module of its own.

**The settlement arm is what makes the two halves total between them** (plan
step X-au-c3).  A row is a PLAN until its money moves and a RECORD of what moved
once it has, and the two never share a column: :func:`settled_figure` answers
from the record, the amount model answers from the plan, and a row is in
exactly one of the two states.  *The plan half used to be named here too, and
NOTHING of it survives.  It was an ``owned_amount`` accessor reading the
``estimated_amount`` column, which plan step X-bu deleted as a second spelling
of what :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_transaction_amount` answers --
the two parted on a row whose plan a cutover had declared DERIVED (finding
BAL-462).  Its leaf, ``own_figure``, outlived it by one step, because
:func:`settled_contribution` below -- then named ``owned_contribution`` --
spelled the same column read at its
fall-through; plan step X-bx deleted that spelling too and moved the leaf into
``cash_ledger._amount_source``, where its only two callers are, as the private
``_own_figure`` (finding BAL-465).  This module states what a row RECORDED and
never what it PLANS.*  Before that split a settled row's record was
optional, so most settled rows fell through to the plan -- and since the plan is
a derivation, the plan had to be frozen at settle to stop a later price change
moving a figure the bank had already taken.

**It was made a LEAF because the loan stack could not NAME the cash-ledger
package, and the gate that forbade it was pylint's** (plan step X-au-c2).
:mod:`~app.services.cash_ledger._amount_source` reached UP into
``loan_payment_service`` for amount rule 4's producer (``LoanPricing``).  That
import was DEFERRED to call time, so no ``import`` STATEMENT closed a loop --
but ``cyclic-import`` (R0401) traces function-level imports too, so a
module-level ``from app.services.cash_ledger import ...`` anywhere reachable
from ``loan_payment_service`` closed the cycle for pylint.

*This paragraph used to add that "importing ``app.services.cash_ledger``
pulled in no loan service at all -- that much an adversarial review measured".
It is DELETED rather than tensed, because it is false and was false when it
was written: ``app/__init__.py`` is the application factory and imports the
tree, so ``import app.services.cash_ledger`` puts 264 app modules in
``sys.modules`` -- ``loan_payment_service`` among them -- on the pre-move tree
and the post-move one alike (measured 2026-08-31, identical both sides).  What
was true is the narrower claim the sentence above now makes: no import
statement in this package NAMED a loan service at module level.*

**THE REACH IS DELETED as of plan step X-au-g-2a, and this paragraph is kept in
the PAST TENSE rather than left standing as a live reason.**  That step moved
rule 4's producer DOWN into ``cash_ledger`` (``_loan_installment`` /
``_loan_pricing``), which is the unwind the paragraph below has always said
``X-au-g`` owes: the amount model is the lower tier and was asking a loan
service to price a row.  What that package names now are loan TERM primitives
-- ``loan_loaders``, ``loan_resolver``, ``escrow_calculator``,
``recurring_transfer_query`` -- none of which names ``cash_ledger``, so the
loan READING stack is free to import it, and plan step X-au-g-2c SPENT that
freedom: ``loan_payment_service.get_payment_history`` prices its feed through
``cash_ledger.contributions_by_id`` now, not through the accessor below.

**So this module's split is no longer FORCED, and saying so is the point of
keeping the history.  What survives is the SEAM; its ADDRESS is now
arbitrary.**  The arms here answer from the row alone and consult no producer,
which is a real distinction whichever tier can reach it -- but that argues for
a seam, not for a separate top-level module: ``cash_ledger._amounts`` and
``cash_ledger._amount_source`` are already two modules for exactly this
producer / no-producer split, inside one package.  Its registry scope stands
on separate ground
(``shekel_checkers/_fence_rulings._ROW_VALUATION_MODULES`` -- extracting a
fenced module's contents into an unfenced neighbour is finding N-28's shape,
which never depended on the cycle).  Whether it should FOLD BACK into
``cash_ledger`` now that it can is a question X-au-g-2a deliberately did not
take -- a second change, with its own diff and its own review -- and silence
here is not an answer to it.  There is still exactly ONE definition of each
rule, which is the claim :mod:`app.services.cash_ledger._amounts` exists to
make; it simply lives in a file both tiers can reach.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture / B6-01): ORM rows in,
``Decimal`` out; no Flask import, no writes, and no query this module ISSUES.
:func:`settled_figure` reads the ``entries`` relationship for EVERY settled
row since plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-1``, which lazy-loads if a caller did
not eager-load it -- the same access ``status_seam.covered_cash_leg`` makes
for a settled row, and the fold's own loader, the grid's and the companion's
issue ``selectinload(Transaction.entries)`` so no routed caller pays for it
per row.

    ``balance:X-bi-4b-1`` :func:`settled_figure` below is the same reduction

    would close a cycle.  The second is that the old name referred to

    **The one accessor for the settlement record** (plan step X-au-c3), and the
    reason the amount model needs no freeze.  A row is a PLAN --
    ``estimated_amount`` priced by ``amount_source_id`` -- until its money moves,
    and once it has, it also carries a RECORD.  Every money reader of a settled
    row asks this and never the plan, so a definition's price series may gain
    a version dated into the past -- which it legitimately does, because a
    series records what a price WAS -- without moving a figure the bank
    already took.

    **THE RECORD IS THE ROW'S ENTRIES, and the figure is their sum** (plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-4b-1``, ruling **R-BAL80**; the readers move here,
    the columns go at ``X-bi-4b-2``).  A bill's, a paycheck's or a transfer
    leg's money is its one covering movement (``status_seam._covering``,
    ruling **R-BAL39**); an envelope's is its purchases; a close of nothing
    holds no entry and records ``$0.00`` (ruling **R-BAL82**: a movement of
    nothing is not one, so a ``$0.00`` close is a close with no entries).  One
    kind-blind reduction, the same one :func:`purchases_total` performs for
    the close that books it and ``posting_reads.settled_figure_clause``
    performs in SQL, over the same rows the fold books one by one on their
    own days (``cash_ledger._events.settled_cash_facts`` reads the movements
    and nothing of the row, ruling **R-BAL80**; a card purchase is a row of
    the record that moves no cash of its own, :func:`purchases_total` says
    why) -- so the figure a screen shows and the money the balance counts
    are read off ONE home.  Through ``X-bi-4a`` this read the
    row's own ``settled_amount`` / ``settled_basis_id`` -- a ``derived`` or
    ``corrected`` record's stored figure, a ``purchases`` record's entry sum
    -- and REFUSED a settled row recording nothing; the columns were the
    covering movement's stale cache (rule 14), and the refusal guarded a
    state that has no spelling here: a settled row with no entries IS the
    ``$0.00`` record.

    **THE STATUS DECIDES, NOT THE RECORD** (plan step X-au-c3, developer
    2026-08-17).  A row that has been reverted out of the settled band still
    CARRIES what it recorded -- a revert releases the assertion (``settled_on``
    and the clearing link) and keeps what moved (the covering movement,
    un-dated, ruling **R-BAL61**), so the revert / edit / re-settle round trip
    the full-edit popover instructs the user to perform does not destroy a
    figure they read off a statement (``status_seam.apply_status_change``).
    What keeps that retained figure out of every balance is this gate: a row
    that is not settled is worth its PLAN, whatever it still remembers.
    Reading the record's presence here instead would be the same question
    answered by the wrong fact -- and it is the reason a first version of

    The one statement of the two arms that answer before the amount model is

      * a row that does not contribute -- soft-deleted, Credit or Cancelled --
        is worth ``0``, whatever prices it; and
      * a row whose money has MOVED is worth what it recorded
        (:func:`settled_figure`), because a record of what left the account is a
        fact and a plan is a forecast.

    ``None`` means neither applies -- the row has not settled -- and its own
    amount decides, which is the resolver's question.

    **The second arm was ``txn.actual_amount`` until plan step X-au-c3**, and the
    difference is the whole step.  That column was only populated when a human
    typed a correction, so a settled row that had no correction answered ``None``
    here and fell through to its PLAN -- and because a plan is a derivation, the
    plan then had to be frozen at settle so a later price change could not move a
    recorded past.  A settled row now always answers, so no settled row's balance
    reads its plan and there is nothing to freeze.

    **The first arm is why the status gate sits ABOVE the resolver** (plan step
    X-au-c2).  ``Transaction.effective_amount`` answered ``$0.00`` for an
    excluded row from inside the valuation, where the resolver of the day would
    REFUSE the same row: both live producers filtered to Projected rows, so a
    Cancelled salary row was absent from the map and had no derived answer at
    all.  *NEITHER producer survives -- ``cash_ledger.LoanPricing.live_cash``

    asking what it is PRICED at is what stops an excluded row paying for a

    ANSWER.  Since ruling **R-BAL81** all three read

    left is settled-only by its own query -- a claim the refusal states
    rather than a docstring asserts, and nowhere does it reach a user as a
    500.

    **It is :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contribution_of`'s PARTIAL twin,

    excluded row to ``0`` and answer a settled row from its SETTLEMENT, through
    the one :func:`fixed_contribution` below.  Where a row has NOT settled, that
    one resolves the row's plan and this REFUSES -- so the two can never
    disagree about a figure, only about whether there is one to give.

    **The refusal is the step, and what it replaced was a SECOND SPELLING of
    the plan** (finding **BAL-465**).  This fell through to
    ``own_figure(txn.estimated_amount, ...)``: the plan column read by hand,
    where ``cash_ledger.resolve_transaction_amount`` is the one producer of a
    row's plan.  That is the defect ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14 names, and the one
    plan step X-bu deleted from the BUDGET side (``owned_amount``, finding
    **BAL-462**); it was unexposed here only because :func:`fixed_contribution`
    answers a settled row first, which is a head start and not a guarantee.

    **Routing that fall-through to the RESOLVER was the other option, and it is
    the wrong answer for these readers** (developer, 2026-09-06).  Their
    question is what a row's money DID, and a row that has not settled has done
    nothing: a settled row's record means CONFIRMED cash effect, so pricing
    a projected row's forecast there would publish a plan as a fact.  That is the
    substitution plan step X-au-c3 exists to remove, and :func:`settled_figure`
    refuses to perform it for exactly the same reason.  Resolving would also
    have made today's LOUD failure silent: a derived projected row raises here
    now, and the amount model would have priced it.

    **THE SEVEN-CALLER CENSUS THIS DOCSTRING CARRIED IS DELETED, AND THAT IS THE
    POINT OF THE STEP.**  It listed every call site and had to be RE-RUN at each
    per-kind cutover that widened the derived class, because a wider derived
    class widened what this accessor could be handed and the fall-through would
    price it from a column that may not exist.  There is nothing left to widen
    into: the precondition is stated by the call rather than asserted about it.

    *A mutation probe measured the change before it was made (2026-09-06): with
    this fall-through spliced to a refusal the full suite ran **13,338 passed,
    9 failed**, and all nine were TESTS calling the accessor directly on a
    Projected row, with no app frame in any traceback.  **That number bounds
    LESS than it appears to, and two adversarial reviews said so
    independently.**  Three ``statement_match`` readers catch
    :class:`~app.exceptions.AmountUnresolvable` by name and answer around it, so
    on those paths the refusal changes an ANSWER rather than failing a test --
    a green suite cannot tell "never reached" from "reached and re-answered"
    there.  What the probe does establish is the narrower claim: no path turns
    this into a 500.  The three catchers are graded by cases added with this
    step, because before it the suite entered none of them.*

    **The NAME changed with the body** -- it was ``owned_contribution``, and it
    asserted that the row owns its figure.  That is not what this function is
    about and was never what its readers meant, and the stale assertion was
    load-bearing rather than cosmetic: a :class:`~app.models.transfer.Transfer`
    was handed to it (``tests/test_routes/test_transfers.py``), and a
    ``Transfer`` defines no ``estimated_amount`` at all, so the Cancelled row's
    ``0`` was the only thing between that call and an ``AttributeError``.

    **The history the deleted census recorded is kept in ONE sentence, because
    it is a reason and not a list.**  Two readers were once not settled-only --
    ``loan_payment_service.get_payment_history`` (finding **N-266**(a)) and

    routed both onto :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id`,
    which is where a reader that may see a PROJECTED row still belongs.  The
    two drafts of that paragraph were wrong in opposite directions, one claiming
    every caller was settled-only while a survivor stood and the next still
    naming the survivor after it had moved; a claim quoted as a REASON decays
    invisibly, because nobody re-checks a premise.  Neither draft could be wrong
    now: the refusal states the precondition instead of a docstring asserting it.

    Args:
        txn: The row being valued.  Its caller's query has already restricted it
            to a settled status; ``is_deleted`` and the ``status`` relationship
            are read first (``status`` is ``lazy="joined"``), then the
            settlement record.

    Returns:
        ``0`` for a row that contributes nothing -- soft-deleted, Credit or
        Cancelled -- else the figure the row RECORDED as having moved.

    Raises:
        AmountUnresolvable: When the row has NOT settled, so it recorded
            nothing and this reader was handed a row outside its own scope.

    :func:`settled_contribution`'s twin over a transfer leg (leaf
    ``X-bi-6-1b``): the Spending report's settled-spend readers load their
    legs with ``Transfer.status_id IN settled`` in SQL, exactly as they load
    their rows, so a refusal here states that precondition rather than a
    docstring asserting it, and a leg handed to a settled-only reader outside
    its scope fails loud instead of publishing its PLAN as money that moved.

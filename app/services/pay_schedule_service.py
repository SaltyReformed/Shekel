"""
Shekel Budget App -- Pay Schedule Service

Reads and writes the per-user ``budget.pay_schedule`` row -- the owner-level
configuration a schedule cannot derive from its own rows -- and the
``budget.pay_eras`` rows that hang off it: one era per *how I have been paid
since*, carrying the cadence, its kind, the phase and the payday convention
(plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-a``, ruling **R-PC58**).

**The RHYTHM is an ERA's fact and the ROW holds what is the owner's**, and the
doors here are split on that line.  An era's ``cadence_days``, ``shift_id``
and ``effective_from`` are what a pay CALENDAR is derived from, and
:func:`resolve_schedule` answers every era in ONE read as
:class:`ScheduleFacts`, the cadence and the convention of each travelling as
the :class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm` the derivation displaces under
and the opening bound beside them.  ``rolling_enabled`` and
``rolling_target_periods`` configure the on-request top-up and are read off
the row itself by the caller that is about to write; ``history_opens_on``
bounds the earliest era's backward rhythm and is the owner's because only that
era has one.

*Until ``C17-a`` the row held one ``cadence_days``, one ``shift_id`` and one
``nominal_anchor``, and* ``upsert_schedule`` *rewrote all three on every batch
that recorded a payday -- so "correct my cadence going forward" silently
re-described every PAST payday too (ledger row **N-492**), and the extend path
re-judged the stored pair on every ``/grid`` render by handing it back through
that door (**N-494**).  That door is gone.*  **This module READS the eras and
writes the schedule row; :mod:`app.services.pay_era_write` writes the eras**
-- the reader / writer split ``pay_period_service`` / ``pay_period_write``
already draws for the paydays (plan step C3-b), made for the same reason: an
era is minted by ``mint_era`` when a batch states a rhythm the era covering
its first payday does not hold, retired by ``retire_eras`` when a later batch
supersedes it, and the two refusals both writers ask live HERE, beside the
column bounds they state.

**:class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm` and :class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Era`
are DECLARED in a pure leaf and imported here** (plan step ``C14-e``,
extended at ``C17-a``).  Each is a frozen value with no session behind it,
and this module holds a session, so declaring them here would put them out
of reach of the derivation that must read them.  Rule 14's remedy for a leaf
a layer has misplaced is to move the leaf, not to mint a second one; see that
module for the whole argument.

**It no longer owns the advisory lock that serializes the structural
pay-period mutations** (plan step X-f1c3c).  That lock moved, unchanged
in key and namespace value, to
:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock` -- because the posting-ledger
reconciles need the SAME lock, not a second one: a reconcile derives each
correction's pay period from the owner's calendar, so a concurrent
truncate can delete the period it is filing under.  Two locks would also
be the only way this app could deadlock.  See that module for the whole
argument.

Flask-isolated -- takes and returns plain data, never imports
``request`` / ``session``.  Flushes so callers see assigned ids, but
never commits: the route layer owns the transaction.

    """The facts a pay CALENDAR is built from: the owner's eras, and the bound.

    Plan step **balance:X-bh-2**, reshaped at **pay_calendar:C17-a**.  One
    value rather than several return types because they arrive from one load
    and are read by one consumer -- a
    :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar` needs them all, and
    resolving them separately would be several queries of the same rows per
    calendar load, which is exactly the redundant-schedule-read defect ledger
    rows **P68** and **P69** record.

    **It carries the ERAS, not a rhythm** (ruling **R-PC58**).  Until
    ``C17-a`` it carried the schedule row's one cadence and one convention as
    a :class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm` beside a ``nominal_anchor``;
    a pay schedule is a SEQUENCE OF ERAS now, and this value is that sequence
    with the owner's history bound beside it.  :attr:`rhythm` still answers --
    the LATEST era's -- for the reader of the CURRENT rhythm, the cadence
    door (:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.cadence_for`); the extend door
    read it too until plan step ``C17-c-2b``, where it stopped stating a
    rhythm.  The calendar itself takes the whole sequence since plan step
    ``C17-b-2``, every reader asking the era covering its own day.

    **It is the facts OF AN OWNER WHO HOLDS AN ERA, and cannot say
    otherwise** (ruling **R-PC45**'s principle, one relation over).  The
    tuple is NON-EMPTY: an owner with a schedule row and no era has stated no
    rhythm, and :meth:`of` answers ``None`` for them rather than a value whose
    :attr:`rhythm` would raise.  "This owner has no calendar at all" is
    therefore one optional -- :func:`resolve_schedule` answering ``None`` --
    rather than a value carrying an absence a reader must remember to test.

    **It carries the calendar facts and NOT the rolling ones.**
    ``rolling_enabled`` and ``rolling_target_periods`` configure a WRITE
    (the on-request top-up); these describe the owner's rhythm, which is
    what a calendar derives from.  A caller that needs the rolling half wants
    the row itself (:func:`get_schedule`), because it is about to write.

            that inferred a cadence closed findings **P8** and **P35** on its

            backward rhythm answers by counting only the record.  It is the
            one optional here because the COLUMN is nullable; there is NO

    CHECK constraint** (plan step **C14-b**, ruling **R-PC59**,
    developer 2026-09-05).
    A convention that moves a payday off a closed day is not injective: two
    nominal paydays closer together than the longest run of consecutive closed
    days displace onto ONE day, and
    ``pay_calendar._derive.derive_periods`` refuses a repeated payday outright,
    so the owner's whole calendar would raise rather than render.

    **Two reasons, and an earlier draft of this docstring claimed three.**
    An adversarial review of 2026-09-05 struck the third and corrected the
    premise of the second; the count is restated here rather than left to
    decay.

    1. **The floor is DERIVED.**  It is the longest closed run plus one, proved
       and computed by
       :func:`~app.utils.business_days.shortest_collision_free_cadence`, and it
       moves with the holiday set -- which is not fixed
       (``business_days.JUNETEENTH_FIRST_YEAR`` records the set changing once
       inside the window this application admits).  A CHECK expression must be
       IMMUTABLE, so a constraint could only freeze a copy where nothing can
       recompute it.
    2. **A constraint cannot name a FIELD.**  It arrives as an
       ``IntegrityError`` carrying a constraint name, where a form needs the
       message on the control the owner chose -- which is what
       :func:`~app.schemas.validation.pay_periods.validate_derivable_rhythm`
       supplies, and the same reason plan step X-ad-a moved the cadence bound
       out from behind ``ck_pay_schedule_cadence_range``.

    *The struck reason was "which id means ``none`` is seed data, so a CHECK
    would hard-code a ``ref`` id".  True of the naive spelling and defeasible:
    a pinned id verified by a migration-time assertion, or NULL standing for
    "no convention", both dodge it.  Each has its own cost -- and the first two
    reasons stand on their own -- but a defeasible reason is not a structural
    one and stating it as such overclaimed.*

    **What this placement does NOT buy, and a CHECK would not have bought
    either.**  The refusal is asked on WRITE, so neither it nor a frozen
    constraint sees a STORED row that a later holiday change made illegal --
    ``ADD CONSTRAINT`` does scan existing rows, but only when some migration
    re-adds it.  Nothing reconciles ``budget.pay_schedule`` today.

    **A floor RISE no longer surfaces on a read path** (plan step
    ``C17-a``, closing ledger row **N-494**).  The continue path used to
    re-judge the STORED pair -- ``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` handed
    it back through the schedule row's upsert -- and the rolling top-up
    reaches that path from ``routes/grid`` and ``routes/dashboard`` with no
    ``except ValidationError``, so an owner whose stored pair a later holiday
    change made illegal would have met a 500 on the two screens they use
    most.  A batch that CONTINUES an era writes no rhythm now, so this is
    asked only where a rhythm is STATED.  What a stored pair made illegal
    still meets is ``pay_calendar.covering_projection``'s refusal, which
    reaches the "Pay Calendar Unavailable" page rather than a bare 500; that
    nothing reconciles ``budget.pay_eras`` against a moved holiday set is
    ledger row **N-493**, still open.

    ``none`` displaces nothing, so it is legal at every cadence and returns
    before the floor is computed -- which is also why the walk behind that
    floor is paid only by an owner who actually chooses a convention.

    Args:
        rhythm: The :class:`Rhythm` the operation will LEAVE BEHIND, which is
            not necessarily the stored one -- a request that shortens the

            legal pair, and judging either half against the stored other half
            would refuse it.

    argument, which is the conditional-write shape ``set_rolling`` already
    avoids by being separate.

    **``None`` is a real value to write, not a skip.**  Clearing the field is
    how an owner WITHDRAWS a statement -- after which the engine counts only

    both and asking for them separately would query one row twice per calendar
    load, which is the redundant per-render schedule read ledger rows **P68**
    and **P69** record.

    **It reads the stored row and nothing else, since plan step C4-b-2**, which
    closed findings **P8** and **P35** by making the state the deleted arm
    existed for UNREPRESENTABLE.  That arm inferred a row-less owner's cadence
    from their last period's length -- ``(end_date - start_date).days + 1`` --
    and it was wrong in two ways at once.  It was CIRCULAR: since plan step
    C3-b :func:`app.services.pay_period_write.record_paydays` derives that same
    last end FROM this answer, so it read back the value it had produced and
    could be neither right nor wrong.  And it was unbounded ABOVE, where the
    stored cadence was bounded to 1..365 by the column's CHECK (then
    ``budget.pay_schedule.cadence_days`` under ``ck_pay_schedule_cadence_range``;
    ``budget.pay_eras.cadence_days`` under ``ck_pay_eras_cadence_range`` since
    plan step ``C17-a``): a hand-written period spanning more than a year
    inferred a cadence ``app.services.pay_calendar`` refuses, and since plan
    step C2-c that raise reaches every balance page as a bare 500.

    What makes the arm unreachable is ``fk_pay_periods_schedule``, the key
    :class:`~app.models.pay_period.PayPeriod` carries: a pay period's owner has
    a ``budget.pay_schedule`` row or the row cannot exist.  So the arm is
    DELETED rather than left standing over a state no database can hold -- an
    unreachable branch is a claim nothing grades, and the next reader cannot
    tell it from a live one.

    **``None`` is still a real answer, and since plan step C4-d it is the
    WHOLE answer rather than a pair of them** (ruling **R-PC45**).  Before, it
    meant "no schedule row AND no period to infer from"; then C4-b-2 narrowed
    it to "no schedule row", which the key makes sufficient -- such an owner has
    no pay periods either.  What this step changed is where that absence is
    SPELT.  It used to be a ``ScheduleFacts`` with both fields ``None``, so the
    absence of a row and the absence of a stated history shared one encoding
    and a THIRD pair -- no cadence beside a stated opening -- was constructible
    and unrepresentable.  Now the absence is this function's own return: there
    is no row, so there are no facts, so there is no value.

    That is an ordinary owner: a companion account
    (``routes/settings.companion_create`` writes neither), or any user before
    registration records their first batch.  The extend path reads it as
    "generate your first schedule first".

    **The two doors above the calendar refuse it and this one does not**, which
    is the split C4-d makes explicit rather than leaves to chance.  This is the
    SOFT door: it answers "does this owner have a schedule" and a caller decides
    what that means, which is what ``routes/salary/profiles._paychecks_per_year``
    needs -- a FORM must not 500 on the state the form itself repairs.  The HARD
    doors are :func:`app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for` and
    :func:`app.services.pay_calendar.cadence_for`, which answer or raise
    ``PayCalendarError``, because every figure they feed is a per-paycheck one.
    Before C4-d the two calendar doors disagreed about this owner -- the cadence
    door refused and the calendar door quietly answered an EMPTY calendar
    carrying no cadence -- and that split is why some screens showed a repair
    page for them and others showed a blank one.

    **Since plan step ``C17-a`` it answers the owner's ERAS rather than one
    rhythm** -- every ``budget.pay_eras`` row as an
    :class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Era`, plus ``history_opens_on`` -- and
    still in one statement, since :func:`get_schedule` joins the eras onto the
    row, which is the property :class:`ScheduleFacts` was shaped to have.

    **``None`` widened by one state at that step**: an owner holding a
    schedule row and NO era has stated no rhythm and gets no facts, exactly as
    an owner with no row does.  No door in ``app/`` produces that owner --
    every batch that records a payday mints an era when none covers it -- and
    the migration backfills one era for every owner holding a payday, so the
    state is reachable only for a row whose paydays were all removed before
    the migration ran.

    **``history_opens_on`` never had a fallback and that asymmetry was the
    point.**  Nothing in ``budget.pay_periods`` says when a job began -- the
    first recorded payday is a record boundary, not an answer -- so an owner who
    HAS a row and has stated nothing carries ``None`` there, and it reads as
    exactly that (ruling **balance:R-IA**, amended 2026-08-31).  It is the one
    optional on :class:`ScheduleFacts`, because its column is.

    Args:
        user_id: The owning user's id.

    Returns:
        The :class:`ScheduleFacts`, or ``None`` when the user has no
        ``budget.pay_schedule`` row -- which by ``fk_pay_periods_schedule`` is

            does not make the door hard**, and the distinction is the one the

            schedule, which a form repairs, where a stored id this application
            cannot name is a ``ref`` table edited under the app and is not a
            state any form repairs.  Named here because every caller of this

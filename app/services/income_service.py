Shekel Budget App -- Income Service (F-20 / MED-06 / F-032).

Single source of truth for what a salary profile PAYS: the paycheck engine's
own :class:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.PaycheckBreakdown`, per period,
never the off-engine ``Decimal(str(profile.annual_salary)) / <a paycheck
count>`` recompute that silently dropped any applicable
:class:`~app.models.salary_raise.SalaryRaise` row pre-Commit-17.
:class:`ProfilePaychecks` is the ONE spelling of a profile's projection (ledger
row **N-443**, plan step **salary:R14-a**) and :class:`SalaryPricing` is what
prices a generated row from it.

**It became a FUNCTION of the payday rather than a LIST at plan step
salary:S3-d**, and that is what deletes the horizon question rather than
answering it.  ``project_profile(profile, calendar)`` returned a list over the
owner's SAVED window, so past the last saved payday there was no paycheck and
:class:`~app.services.investment_projection.AccountPayrollFeed` INVENTED one
by holding a figure -- six rules over that fold, each measured wrong
(**N-541**, ruling **R-SAL10**).

**The hold is GONE since plan step salary:S3-e-2** (ruling **R-SAL15**).
S3-d built the producer that can price a payday past the horizon and moved
every consumer onto it while every one of them still asked for
``calendar.saved()``; S3-e-2 is where the ask widened.  The feed holds two
resolvers over :class:`ProfilePaychecks` now and prices whichever period a
consumer hands it, so nothing states a horizon and nothing holds.
``TestThePricerAnswersPastTheSavedHORIZON`` is what that deletion rested on,
and it is kept: it is the one place the capability is graded on its own.

Widening the list needed somebody to decide HOW LONG, and
one render asks two lengths of it: the balance seam wants the saved window, the
40-year chart wants forty years, and they share one memo.  Nothing decides,
because a paycheck does not depend on any other paycheck --
:func:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck` rebuilds its own
year's month positions and both cumulatives off ``basis.calendar``, which runs
forward past the horizon at the owner's cadence -- so the series is a MAP from
payday to paycheck, defined wherever the rhythm reaches, and a caller asks for
the paydays it actually reads.

**One pricer per profile PER RAISE SET per read pass**, :class:`PaycheckPricing`,
reached through :meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.paychecks` --
per profile alone until plan step salary:S3-f-1, when the raise set became an
input of the engine's basis.  It replaced
the raw ``BalanceContext.payroll_breakdowns`` dict and the ``breakdowns=None``
argument on :func:`~app.services.projection_inputs.load_payroll_feeds` that
meant "no memo at all" -- the hole
``TestOnePaycheckProjectionPerProfilePerRender`` was written to watch, and which
that test's own docstring records two of four callers falling through.  A
consumer is handed the pricer now, so there is nothing left to forget to pass.

**ONE source of a paycheck per read pass since plan step salary:C12.**  Two
survived S3-d -- the pass held one and :class:`SalaryPricing` derived a
second, because the amount basis was built from two ids and had nothing to
hand it (ledger row **P63**) -- and C12 closed it by making the basis TAKE
the pass's pricer.  What it cost, and the interim a pass-less producer still
uses, is stated once at :class:`PaycheckPricing`; the runtime gate
``TestOnePaycheckProjectionPerProfilePerRender`` keeps its subject and counts
:class:`ProfilePaychecks` constructions so a second source cannot return.

**A SCALAR producer stood beside them until plan step salary:R14-b, and it is
DELETED rather than re-pointed.**  ``get_current_gross_biweekly(user_id,
calendar)`` answered "the current per-period gross" for the savings,
retirement and investment feeds, and the shape was the defect: one figure,
read at ONE moment, standing in for a series that every raise moves.  It
carried two more that fell out of that shape and that ``recurrence:R-F16``'s
adversarial review had to REVERT a fix over -- it chose the owner's profile
with an unordered ``.first()`` (a measured **39%** swing on a two-job owner,
flipping between renders with no data change) and it answered ``$0.00``
whenever no pay period covered its clock, which silently deleted a whole
contribution plan at onboarding and after a horizon lapse.

Ruling **R-SAL2** answers all three at once and none of the answers is a
scalar: the PERIOD is the clock, the gross is that period's own off the
engine's breakdown, and the profile is NAMED (by the deduction, or by
``budget.investment_params.salary_profile_id`` -- **R-SAL5**) rather than
searched.  Its consumers read
:class:`~app.services.investment_projection.AccountPayrollFeed` now, which
:func:`app.services.projection_inputs.load_payroll_feeds` folds out of
:class:`ProfilePaychecks`.  This module's own docstring listed those consumers
for as long as it had them; the list is gone with the function.

class ProfilePaychecks:
    """What ONE salary profile pays, asked a PAYDAY at a time and remembered.

    **The ONE spelling of a profile's projection, and closing that it was
    THREE is ledger row N-443** (plan step **salary:R14-a**).  The pair it
    replaced --
    ``tax_config_service.load_tax_configs_for_periods`` over the calendar's
    saved window (the door plan step salary:S3-d replaced with
    :func:`~app.services.tax_config_service.configs_by_year`, which takes
    YEARS rather than a window), then
    :func:`paycheck_calculator.project_salary` on a
    :class:`~app.services.payroll_basis.PayrollBasis` with the profile's
    calibration -- was written out longhand in three places over the same
    calendar: :class:`SalaryPricing` below, ``routes/salary/views.py`` and
    ``routes/salary/cockpit.py``.

    **The three could not simply call each other, and that is why moving the
    leaf was the remedy rather than picking one.**  The two route sites keep
    the whole :class:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.PaycheckBreakdown` --
    they render the anatomy, the chart and the ledger table -- while the
    derivation kept only ``net_pay``, so the shared leaf had to be the
    BREAKDOWN and no existing caller produced one.  Ruling **R-IZ** names
    exactly this shape: a second walk is a cache with no column, agreement is
    not the test, and where a layer puts the shared leaf out of reach the
    remedy is to MOVE THE LEAF.

    **It reads the OWNER off the profile** rather than taking a user id,
    because the two must agree and a caller holding ``current_user.id`` beside
    a profile is a second chance to get it wrong.

    **The tax series is loaded ONCE, here, and every year after is arithmetic**
    (:func:`~app.services.tax_config_service.profile_tax_series` is three
    queries whatever the horizon;
    :func:`~app.services.tax_config_service.configs_by_year` is the pure pick).
    That is what lets :meth:`at` answer a payday nobody knew would be asked
    for without re-reading the tax tables, and it is why this is a VALUE built
    per read pass rather than a free function: a free function would have to
    reload the series, or take it, and the second is the caller-supplied input
    the pass exists to remove.

    **This value's OWN database work is all at construction; the PROFILE's
    need not be, and an adversarial review of plan step salary:S3-d corrected
    a sentence here that claimed otherwise.**
    ``SalaryProfile.raises`` and ``.deductions`` are ``lazy="select"``.  The
    deductions are read by
    :func:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck` on the FIRST
    paycheck priced; the raises are read one call earlier since plan step
    salary:S3-f-1, by :meth:`PaycheckPricing.for_profile` canonicalising the
    raise set for its memo key, and the engine reads only that value.  Whether
    either read issues a SELECT depends on how the caller loaded the profile,
    not on this class.
    :func:`~app.services.projection_inputs.load_payroll_feeds` eager-loads
    them (``subqueryload`` on both); :meth:`SalaryPricing._profile_by_template`
    does not, and that is a pre-existing property of the amount model's
    profile lookup rather than something this step introduced.  It is
    reported, not fixed here: adding eager options to that query changes what
    the amount model reads on every pass that prices a row, which is
    ``balance:X-i1``'s tier and not a producer's to decide.

    **Past the saved schedule it keeps answering, and that is the point of
    plan step salary:S3-d.**  The engine's four calendar judgements -- the
    month position both deduction cadences read, the FICA wage-base cumulative
    and a deduction's annual-cap cumulative -- all come off ``basis.calendar``
    since plan step **balance:X-bh-1**, and that rhythm projects forward at the
    owner's cadence to :data:`~app.utils.dates.CALENDAR_DATE_MAX`
    (:mod:`app.services.pay_calendar._rhythm`).  So a projected payday is
    priced by the same code and the same rules as a saved one; what it lacks is
    a ``budget.pay_periods`` row, which is exactly what
    :attr:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.PeriodInfo.period_id` being
    ``None`` says.

    **The DERIVATION half of the salary amount rule, split from its per-row
    lookup at plan step X-au-c2b, and the one producer of a ROW's amount since
    plan step X-au-d** (finding **N-443** is the two other spellings of the
    projection itself).  What rows a caller happens to have loaded reaches
    none of it: this is pinned to a scenario and a PRICER -- whose owner is
    the owner -- which is what lets one read pass resolve it ONCE however
    many row sets ask (:class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis`).

    **It holds a PRICER since plan step salary:S3-d, where it held a whole
    projection**, and the change is what a row's figure costs.  It memoized
    ``{profile_id: {period_id: PaycheckBreakdown}}`` over the owner's WHOLE
    saved window, so a single row's live amount ran the engine over every
    payday the owner has; it resolves the ONE period the row names now.

    **It TAKES the read pass's pricer since plan step salary:C12**, where it
    derived a second one -- ledger row **P63**, closed there and argued once,
    at :class:`PaycheckPricing`.  The owner is read off that pricer rather
    than handed in beside it, so the pair cannot disagree.

    It was a ``{transaction_id: Decimal}`` map built per row set until that step,
    and the two consequences are why this type exists.  A request that loaded two
    row sets ran the paycheck engine twice (findings **N-268**, **N-269**), and a
    row outside the set it was built over had no answer -- which forced the basis
    to carry the set as a membership guard so the miss could be REFUSED rather
    than read as "this row has no live figure".  Keyed on the definition and the
    period instead, there is no membership question left to get wrong: the pair
    IS the paycheck's identity.

    **Laziness is in TWO stages, and an adversarial review of this step's own
    build is why.**  The first draft resolved one map for every active profile
    on first read, gated only by ``is_income and template_id is not None`` -- a
    test that cannot tell a paycheck template from any other recurring income.
    Both halves of that were a regression against the row-set producer it
    replaced, which filtered its profile query by the CANDIDATE rows' templates
    and returned ``{}`` without projecting anything:

      * a recurring *Interest* or *Dividend* income row -- templated, projected,
        not a paycheck -- forced the whole paycheck engine, where the old path
        paid one indexed query and stopped; and
      * an owner with TWO active profiles paid ``project_salary`` twice on a
        pass whose rows named one of them.

    So the PROFILE LOOKUP is memoized here: asking about a template no profile
    names costs one indexed query and no engine run, and a profile is priced
    only when a row actually asks about it.  The pricing behind it lives for
    the pass, so the sharing this class exists for is unchanged.

    salary profile states a NET PAY, so an expense row on a salary-linked

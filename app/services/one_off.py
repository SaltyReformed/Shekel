"""
Shekel Budget App -- A ONE-OFF is a rule-less definition plus its placed rows

**The ONE producer of a one-off** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-7b``, ruling
**R-BAL20**: every plan item has exactly one definition).  A one-off budget
line used to be a bare ``budget.transactions`` row carrying its own name,
category, flags and figure, with ``template_id IS NULL`` as how the code told
it from a generated row.  It is a DEFINITION now -- a
``budget.transaction_templates`` row with no recurrence rule -- holding the
name, category, flags and price, plus the row(s) it PLACES: one for a grid
one-off, one per paycheck for a bank-born envelope once ``X-f6c`` names the
definition from a merchant rule (**R-BAL24**).  The row holds what is the
row's: its paycheck, its status, its due date.

Four writers made a link-less plan item.  THREE call :func:`place_one_off`
since the family's first leaf -- the grid's two create doors
(``routes/transactions/create.py``) and the row a bank line's money requires
(``statement_match._uncategorized.mint_uncategorized``) -- and the fourth, the
envelope a NEW-ENVELOPE merchant answer creates
(``statement_match._container._create_envelope``), still writes a link-less
row until the third leaf (``X-f6c``'s shape) puts it here.  They differ only
in what they put in :class:`OneOffToPlace`.

**What the producer states, and the ruling each clause is.**

* **The price lives on the definition, and a one-off's series holds ONE
  version dated on the row's due date** (**R-BAL21**).  The row states no
  figure: it is priced through amount rule 3
  (``cash_ledger._amount_source``) by its definition's series as of its own
  due date, exactly as ``X-au-f`` ruled for the one-time transfer.  With one
  version the series is flat on every date, so the row's date can move
  freely and prices nothing differently.
* **A one-off is due on its placed paycheck's START unless the owner states
  a date** (**R-BAL22**) -- the rule the transfer twin states for its own row
  (``routes/transfers/_instances._materialize_one_time_transfer``; ``X-ci``
  is where the two spellings meet), balance-neutral by construction because
  ``DerivedPeriod.attribution_day`` already budgets an undated item to its
  paycheck's start.  (The spec also named
  ``carry_forward_service._leftover_due_date``; its rule-less arm was
  deleted at 7a and it reads the cadence now.)
* **The row records its own due date as the occurrence it answers**
  (``occurs_on = due_date``, **R-BAL25**), so no row answers no occurrence
  and ``recurrence:R19-b``'s NOT NULL binds on it.  Every later writer of
  a placed row's date goes through :func:`state_due_date`, so the two
  columns cannot part.
* **A period move RE-PLACES the row** (**R-BAL33**, leaf 7b-2): moved to
  another paycheck it takes that paycheck's start as its due date unless
  its date was not its old paycheck's start -- an owner-stated day, read by
  position -- which is R-BAL22's default following the placement
  (:func:`due_date_after_move`).  Both doors that move a row take it:
  carry-forward's move-whole arm and the popover's period move.
* **A typed figure is RESTATED on the definition, in place** (**R-BAL29**,
  leaf 7b-2): the version the row's due date reads takes the figure, the
  series stays one version, and the row stays priced by it
  (:func:`restate_price`).  A row the interim between the family's first two
  leaves detached (OWN with ``is_override``) is re-attached by the same act
  (**R-BAL37**).
* **The row carries no flag.**  ``tracks_purchases`` and
  ``visible_to_companion`` read the definition for every template-linked
  row, so the sealed cells on the row are never written here; the cutover
  leaf deletes them.

:func:`place_row_of` is the placing half alone -- a row of an EXISTING
rule-less definition in a paycheck -- split out because a bank-born envelope
definition places one row per paycheck it is filed into (**R-BAL24**), and
because it states the five definition-derived columns through the same
:func:`~app.services.recurrence_engine.unruled_row_fields` the maintain twin
re-declares them with, so a row as born and a row as re-declared cannot
differ.

**The definition carries no scenario.**  Definitions never have; a one-off
created in a non-baseline scenario mints one that carries none and places its
row in the submitted scenario, noted rather than forked while one scenario
exists and the selector is a stub (**R-BAL26**).

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in, ORM rows
out, no Flask import, no clock read.  It MUTATES and FLUSHES -- the row's
foreign keys need the definition's id -- and does NOT commit; the caller
owns the unit of work.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (8/7) -- the eight ARE one
    fact, and there is one per column of ``budget.transaction_templates`` an
    owner STATES about a plan item (``is_active`` and ``sort_order`` take
    their defaults; a one-off is born live and unordered): what the owner (or
    the bank) said this plan item IS.  What is NOT here is where its row goes -- the paycheck,
    the scenario, the due date -- which :func:`place_one_off` takes as the
    same placing arguments :func:`place_row_of` does, because a one-off is a
    definition PLUS a placed row (**R-BAL20**) and the object mirrors that
    split rather than hiding it.  Decomposing the eight further would split
    one table's row across two values.

    **A parameter object because the producer is PUBLIC and reached from
    more than one module** -- two today, a third at the family's third leaf
    (this project's remedy for a public function over the argument bound): a
    signature that cannot be read at a call site is read wrong at each of
    them.

            ``pay_calendar:C13-a``).  The caller has proved the account, the

            two composite keys refuse the row otherwise.
        account_id: The account the money moves through.
        transaction_type_id: Expense or income.
        name: What the plan item is called.  ``budget.transaction_templates
            .name`` is ``String(200)`` and NOT NULL, as the row's is; the
            bank door cuts its merchant string to fit before building this.
        amount: What it is planned to cost, which becomes the definition's
            ONE version dated on the row's due date (**R-BAL21**).  ``0.00``
            is legal -- a bank-born envelope budgets nothing, because
            nothing budgeted it.
        category_id: What the money IS, or ``None`` where nothing can say so
            -- the bank door's row for money it could not categorise
            (**R-FN**), which is why ``transaction_templates.category_id``
            is nullable since migration ``9c1e4b7a2d3f``.  Every grid door
            requires one at its schema.

            the DEFINITION's setting, read for every row by
            ``Transaction.tracks_purchases``.

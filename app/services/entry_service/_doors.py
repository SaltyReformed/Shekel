"""The WRITE doors: what a user may do to one purchase, and what follows.

``entry_service``'s CRUD half -- the guards a mutation must pass, the three
doors themselves (create, update, delete), the owner resolution they share, and
the re-derivation every one of them triggers.  What a set of purchases ADDS UP
TO, and the screen contexts built from those sums, is the sibling leaf
(:mod:`._sums`); the arrow runs one way -- this module reads
the reductions in :mod:`._sums`, and that module reads nothing here.

Architecture:
  - No Flask imports.  Receives plain data, returns ORM objects or
    raises exceptions.
  - All monetary arithmetic uses Decimal.
  - Flushes to the session but does NOT commit.  The caller owns the
    database transaction boundary.

    """Reconcile an envelope's postings after an entry change.

    **It writes no figure, and losing that half is plan step X-au-c3's doing.**
    It re-derived ``actual_amount = sum(entries)`` for a settled envelope, and a
    settled row stores no figure at all -- its amount IS the sum of its
    entries, answered on read by ``row_valuation.settled_figure`` (the
    envelope's since X-au-c3, every settled row's since ``balance:X-bi-4b-1``,
    and the row's own figure columns gone at ``X-bi-4b-2``).  A stored copy is
    what needed a reconciler; with the copy gone the reconciler has nothing
    left to reconcile, and the entries and the figure they add up to cannot
    drift because there is only one of them.

    **Its whole gate was ``if settled and txn.entries``, and BOTH halves of that
    gate are gone.**  The figure it would have written no longer exists to
    write, and the ``settled`` half stopped being a question this function may
    ask: a settled parent DOES reach here, through the one entry edit
    :func:`_reject_settled_parent` admits on such a row -- recording the day
    the bank took a purchase -- and re-dating that purchase's cash is the whole
    point of the reconcile below.  Two defects went with the deleted arm:

      * deleting the LAST purchase from a settled envelope left the previous
        figure standing -- deliberately, because rewriting the close to ``$0.00``
        looked worse than a stale number.  That state is unreachable now for a
        different reason than when this was written: it said *the delete is
        refused*, and plan step ``bank_import:X-f6f`` admits one where removing
        the purchase cannot change what the row's own close booked.  What makes
        the stale figure impossible is that there is no stored figure left to go
        stale -- a settled row answers ``Sigma(entries)``, so one closed
        empty answers ``$0.00`` because that is what its records say;
      * adding a purchase to a settled row whose figure was a HUMAN's correction
        overwrote that correction with the entry sum.  That cannot happen now
        for two independent reasons: the hook is gone, and
        :func:`_reject_settled_addition` admits an add only on a settled row
        holding no covering movement -- one whose entries ARE its record, so
        there is no stated figure for a human to have corrected.  Ruling
        **R-FB**'s rule -- a figure somebody read off a statement is a fact --
        finally holds on this path too.

    What remains is the ledger reconcile (Build-Order Step 3).  An entry mutation
    changes what the row's family has posted: recording a posting day makes
    that purchase a dated leg of its own, clearing one reverses it, flipping
    an entry to or from credit posts or reverses its leg, and an amount edit
    re-prices a dated one.  The row itself books nothing (plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-4a``, ruling **R-BAL80**), so a purchase with no day moves
    nothing in the ledger -- it is in flight in the projection instead.

    **It is UNGATED since plan step X-f3b, and that is ruling R-FM.**  It ran
    only on the settled band, on the premise that "a Projected envelope has no
    postings" -- false once a purchase carrying a recorded bank posting day
    books its own leg whatever its envelope's status is.  One call reconciles
    the whole family, so this door needs no second list of what changed; on a
    Projected row with no posted purchases it reads an empty ledger and writes
    nothing.

    Does NOT commit -- the calling service function owns the session boundary
    (the reconcile flushes but does not commit, matching this module's
    contract).

    **The reconcile takes no ``settled`` flag since plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-4a``.**  It took one through ``X-bi-3e``, read off the ROW
    rather than hardcoded ``False`` -- a choice that paid for itself when the
    developer's 2026-08-17 ruling widened this door to admit a posting-day
    edit on a settled row, whose own leg a hardcoded ``False`` would have
    silently stopped booking.  The flag chose the row's OWN target, and a row
    has none now: a movement posts iff it is dated under a contributing
    parent, which the reconcile reads off each movement.

            is ``statement_match._create.create_purchase_from_line``, and its

            its own account, **R-BAL75**), or ``None`` for its row's -- where
            the row is EXPECTED to be paid from, which is every purchase's
            account until a card exists and the one every caller but the
            add-purchase form states.  A card swipe in a checking envelope
            names the card here: the envelope's spend grows by the purchase
            whatever account it moved through, checking's fold sees nothing
            on that day, and the card's fold sees the swipe.  The door gates
            it against the ROW's owner, never the caller (a companion records
            the purchase on the owner's card, ruling **R-CC11**), and admits
            exactly what the picker offers -- the row's own account or a
            member of the owner's cash-flow set (ruling **R-CC37**; see
            :func:`_purchase_account_id`).

    **The posting day was deliberately NOT here until plan step

    the doors that existed then.**  It read: *the day the bank took the money is
    an observation, and at the moment a purchase is recorded there is nothing to
    have observed.*  That is exactly right for the add-purchase form, and false
    for a purchase created FROM a bank statement line -- there the observation is
    what caused the record to exist, and it is the more reliable of the two days
    (**R-FW**).

    Recording it here rather than through a follow-up :func:`update_entry` is
    the difference between one act and two: the second call would re-run
    ``sync_entry_payback`` and the posting reconcile against an intermediate
    state in which a purchase the bank has already taken looks outstanding, and
    it would leave that state committed if anything after it refused.

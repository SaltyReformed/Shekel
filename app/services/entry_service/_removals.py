"""What removing each purchase would WITHDRAW -- the purchase list's captions.

Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``, rulings **R-CC80** (developer
2026-09-23, "Every door warns": *"The purchase X and all three card-payback
buttons name the bank line before you press, using the same data the button
acts on, as the popovers do"*), **R-CC127** (the press sends back what its
page named) and **R-CC132** (developer 2026-10-04, "Refuse, shown first": *"On
the companion page a matched purchase has no X"*).  Two controls on an
envelope's purchase list take a movement off the books and can leave a bank
line unexplained: the X, which deletes the purchase -- and, on the envelope's
last card purchase, the CC payback with it -- and the edit form's CC un-tick,
which deletes that payback alone
(``entry_credit_workflow.sync_entry_payback``).  The list names what each
would free before the press, from this read.

**The package's third leaf, and the only one that READS the matches.**
:mod:`._doors` writes and :mod:`._sums`' reductions read no table; this asks
the statement matches and the live paybacks, ONCE per screen however many
purchase lists the screen draws (the grid draws every envelope's, through
:func:`~app.services.entry_service._sums.build_entry_lists_dict`), by
:func:`app.services.match_withdrawal.pending_for_each`.

**The same derivation the press makes.**  Each removal is the movements the
door hands the removal act -- the purchase, and the payback's movements where
the payback goes -- with the rows the press deletes, and whether the payback
goes is :func:`app.services.entry_credit_workflow.payback_deleted_by`, the
read twin of the sync's own delete arm, over the live payback
:func:`app.services.credit_workflow.active_paybacks` names exactly as the
sync's :func:`~app.services.credit_workflow.get_active_payback` does.

Architecture:
  - No Flask imports.
  - Reads; never writes.

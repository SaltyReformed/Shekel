Shekel Budget App -- Transaction Entry Service

CRUD operations, validation, and computation for individual purchase
entries on entry-capable transactions.  This service is the foundation
consumed by the balance calculator (Commit 3), entry credit workflow
(Commit 4), mark-paid logic (Commit 5), and all entry UI (Commits
7, 8, 10).

**The OUTSTANDING SET left this module at plan step X-f2-c1** for
:mod:`app.services.reconcile_service`: "which of these had the bank taken by
the day you asserted a balance for" stopped being a question about ENTRIES
when ruling R-EW widened it to bills, envelope closes and transfer shadows.
That module carries the rule and the measurement that forced the cut.

**It became a PACKAGE at plan step X-f3b**, when ruling **R-FM**'s write-door
work took the module past pylint's 1,000-line ceiling.  That ceiling is a
forcing function rather than a budget (findings **N-152**, **N-201**,
**N-270**): the answer is a shape, not a fourth round of shaved prose.  The
shape was already there --

* :mod:`._doors` -- what a user may DO to one purchase: the guards a mutation
  must pass, create / update / delete, and the re-derivation every door
  triggers.  It writes;
* :mod:`._sums` -- what a SET of purchases adds up to, and the contexts a
  screen renders from those sums.  It does not.

-- and the arrow runs ONE way, ``_doors`` reading the reductions in
:mod:`._sums` and ``_sums`` reading nothing back.  (It named
``_sums.compute_actual_from_entries`` until plan step X-au-c3, which deleted
that helper: the sum it computed is now the row's own ``purchases``-basis
settlement, stated once in
:func:`app.services.row_valuation.purchases_total`.)

**Every public name is re-exported here**, so the split moved no call site:
``entry_service.create_entry`` and ``entry_service.entry_list_view`` resolve
exactly as they did.  That is the property that makes a package the cheap
answer to the ceiling and a sibling module the expensive one.

Architecture:
  - No Flask imports.  Receives plain data, returns ORM objects or
    raises exceptions.
  - All monetary arithmetic uses Decimal.
  - Flushes to the session but does NOT commit.  The caller owns the
    database transaction boundary.

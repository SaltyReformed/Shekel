"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service: the DELETE verb

Removing a transfer, soft or hard, and with it both shadow
:class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` rows -- Transfer Invariant 2, that
a shadow is never orphaned, applied in the one direction that could orphan one.

The ORDER inside is the whole of the module: the posted cash effect is
reversed while the rows still exist to link against, because a hard delete
SET-NULLs those links on its way out; the loan-payment split links no row
(ruling **R-BAL102**) and is re-derived AFTER the payment is gone; and a soft
delete that took a settled transfer's payments off returns it to a plan only
once it is hidden (ruling **R-BAL246**, through ``_status.return_to_plan``),
because the books' revert refusal does not reach a hidden row (ruling
**R-BAL248**).

Flask-isolated like the rest of the package: plain data in, ORM rows out, no
``request`` / ``session`` imports.  Flushes; does NOT commit.

    # (``app/deleted_row_infrastructure``'s transfer arm), so the act runs on

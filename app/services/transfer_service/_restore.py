"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service: the RESTORE verb

The inverse of a soft delete.  It was also the one place the transfer
invariants were REPAIRED rather than merely maintained -- a shadow that had
drifted from its parent while hidden was re-synced on the way back -- until
plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` deleted the shadows and its leaf 3b deleted
the repairs: a transfer is one row, so nothing beside it can drift.

It refuses before it moves (:func:`assert_restorable`, ruling **R-DR**), so a
restore onto an archived account leaves the transfer untouched rather than
half-restored.

Flask-isolated like the rest of the package: plain data in, ORM rows out, no
``request`` / ``session`` imports.  Flushes; does NOT commit.

    """Restore a soft-deleted transfer.

    This is the inverse of ``delete_transfer(soft=True)``: it sets
    ``is_deleted=False`` on the transfer.  It un-deleted both shadows too and
    re-synced their period, category, due date and override flag from the
    parent until plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` deleted the shadows (its
    leaf 3b deleted the loop).

    **It repairs no STATUS and no day, since plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``.**  A shadow's status and day are no longer kept
    or read: the transfer's status is one column, and each side's day is its
    payment record's.  Nor is there a record to bring back: the soft delete
    took each side's records off the books (ruling **R-CC75**, "un-archiving
    brings a deleted occurrence back empty"), and the database refuses to
    hide a transfer still holding one.  **What comes back is a PLAN**: the
    delete set a settled transfer whose records it took off back to
    Projected (ruling **R-BAL246**, "Back as a plan, now"), so a loan reads
    a planned payment rather than a missed installment; a ``$0.00`` close
    held nothing and comes back as it was.  Until that step this verb re-applied
    the pair's status through the seam, repairing a drifted shadow's status
    and borrowing its day from the sibling (ruling **R-BAL142**).

    Idempotent: calling on an already-active transfer is a no-op.

    Args:
        transfer_id: The primary key of the transfer to restore.
        user_id:     The expected owner (defense-in-depth).

    Returns:
        The restored (or already-active) Transfer object.

    Raises:
        NotFoundError: If the transfer does not exist or does not
            belong to user_id.
        ValidationError: If either the source or destination account has
            been archived (``is_active = False``) since the transfer was
            soft-deleted (F-164).  Reactivate the account before restoring.

Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service: what SETTLING a transfer means

The whole act, for all three rows at once: an auto-derived loan payment stops
deriving and OWNS what it is live worth, the status and the settle day land in
ONE seam pass, and a figure a human typed is told apart from the panel's own
prefill echoed back.

**The rule lives here rather than at each door, and that is ruling R-FA applied
to the transfer table.**  It lived in ONE route branch --
``routes/transactions/_shadow_mutations``'s ``_mark_done_shadow``, which called
``loan_payment_service.live_loan_payment_amount`` and handed the answer to
``update_transfer`` as an ``actual_amount`` -- and FOUR doors could move a
transfer into the settled band before this step added a fifth (the reconcile
panel's tick):

* the grid's shadow "Mark Paid" (``_mark_done_shadow``), which froze;
* the transfers page's "Mark Done" (``routes/transfers/mutations.mark_done``),
  which did not;
* the transfer full-edit Status dropdown (``_execute_transfer_update``), which
  did not;
* a transaction PATCH landing on a shadow (``_apply_shadow_update``), which did
  not.

That is finding **N-219**'s shape one table over -- a ROUTE holding a money
rule, so one control books a different figure from another for the same payment.

**WHICH COLUMN the freeze writes is deliberately NOT changed here, and the
reason is measured rather than conservative.**  The figure is the APP's
derivation, so ruling **R-FH** says it belongs in the row's OWN amount and
``actual_amount`` should hold a human's figure alone; finding **N-241** records
that it does not.  This leaf BUILT that move and then withdrew it, because two
adversarial reviews measured it unsafe on today's schema:

* ``cash_ledger._loan_installment._manual_shadow_amount`` derives a manual payment's cash
  as ``estimated_amount + extra`` and documents that column as *"always the
  generated base"*.  Writing the freeze there makes the derivation read its own
  output, so a settle / revert / settle cycle COMPOUNDS the standing extra --
  measured ``$1,599.10 -> $1,699.10 -> $1,799.10``.  *Both halves of that
  hazard are gone: plan step X-au-c3 moved the record off the plan, and plan
  step X-au-g-2c-2 deleted the producer that read the column;*
* what a row is worth prefers a human's ``actual_amount`` over its own amount,
  and nothing clears a leftover ``actual_amount`` when a transfer is reverted
  (finding **N-257**), so a freeze written to ``estimated_amount`` is silently
  OUTRANKED by it -- the panel offers the frozen figure and the settle books
  the stale one, ``$99.10`` apart on the reviewed measurement.

Both hazards are the same shape: the write is neither idempotent nor
authoritative while the schema has no way to say whether a row's amount is its
OWN or DERIVED.  Ruling **R-FI**'s ``amount_source`` column is exactly that
statement, and plan step **X-au-c** adds it -- so the column move is that step's,
and the developer ruled it there (2026-08-12).  What THIS leaf does instead is
put the write in ONE place, so moving it is a one-line change rather than a hunt
across four modules.

**What it costs on production today is `$0.00`, and the reason is worth
stating**: ``budget.loan_payment_settings`` holds ZERO rows, so
``loan_payment_config`` answers ``(False, 0.00)`` for every transfer template
and every shadow resolves to its parent's own figure -- which every shadow
already equalled (re-measured 2026-09-01 at stamp ``a4c6f1d92b73``: 0 of 350
differ).  The split opens the first time a loan payment transfer is created
through ``routes/loan/payment_transfer.py``, which is a live route.

    """Settle a transfer -- both legs and the parent -- and say whose figure it booked.

    **The whole act, in one function, and that is what the four doors buy from
    it.**  A settle is not a status change with extras: it decides what the row
    is worth, records that the money moved, and dates it, and a door that does
    two of those three books a figure the third contradicts.

    Two acts, in this order, and the order is the rule:

    1. **The figure, decided but not yet written.**  What the expense LEG is
       worth (:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.leg_contribution_of`, the
       parent's resolved amount) is asked ONCE, before anything moves -- after
       the status flip it would answer from the record this act is about to
       write.  A RETAINED
       correction (:func:`~app.services.status_seam.honoured_figure` over the
       expense side's record) outranks that derivation, and a figure a HUMAN supplied NOW outranks
       both: it is compared against what the row would book anyway and is a
       CORRECTION only if it differs.  A figure somebody read off a statement is
       a fact; a derivation is an inference.
    2. **The status, each side's settle day and the RECORD, in ONE seam
       pass.**  A side's day is the caller's when it states one -- the
       reconcile tick's statement date for the leg on the statement's account
       -- so the pair is dated once rather than stamped with today and
       corrected afterwards.  That second write was this module's own defect:
       the settle went through the door ruling **R-ED** built for a user
       CORRECTING a day (``apply_settle_day_correction``, deleted at plan step
       ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``), so every tick wrote ``settled_on`` twice and
       the intermediate value was a day the money did not move.  The side
       nobody stated for borrows the stated side's day (ruling **R-BAL142**).
       The figure rides in the same call
       (``status_seam.Settlement``) and lands on BOTH sides' records, because
       a transfer's money moves on its sides.

    **It was THREE acts until plan step X-au-c3**, the third being a separate
    write of the figure into ``actual_amount`` after the seam.  One call is what
    makes "a settled row states what moved" a property of the seam rather than a
    convention each settle verb keeps -- the seam REFUSES a row entering the
    settled band with no record -- and it is why a refused transition can no
    longer leave a money column written by a settle that did not happen.

    **An ECHO is not recorded as a correction.**  The reconcile panel PREFILLS
    its amount box, so an untouched tick posts the figure the row would book
    anyway; recording it as ``corrected`` would destroy the only stored signal
    that says a human read a number off a statement (ruling **R-FB**'s
    production measurement, "11 of 93 settled bills carry a hand-typed
    correction", is made of exactly that signal).  The figure is still RECORDED
    either way -- on the ``derived`` basis -- which is the difference from the
    world before this step, where an uncorrected settle recorded nothing and
    every reader fell back to the row's plan.

    **A settle never CLEARS the record, and there is no door that does.**  A
    ``figure`` arriving without a settling status is REFUSED outright
    (``_update._apply_transfer_fields``), because a figure states what MOVED and
    an unsettled pair has moved nothing.  Correcting a recorded figure is
    revert, edit, settle again -- the revert KEEPS what moved and the re-settle
    honours it (act 1 above), so the round trip is lossless.
    ``settle_transaction`` follows the same rule one table over, so the two
    settles cannot come to disagree.

    **The figure lands in the row's OWN settlement record, and that is what
    closed finding N-241.**  It went to ``actual_amount`` -- a column ruling
    **R-FH** reserves for a figure a HUMAN supplied -- so a machine-derived
    freeze written there manufactured a correction nobody made.  A record
    that says WHO wrote its figure (the covering movement's
    ``figure_source_id`` since plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-1``; the row's
    ``settled_basis_id`` through ``X-bi-4a``) leaves the freeze nothing to
    overwrite, and the column it was hiding in is gone.

    Mutates in place.  Does NOT flush, commit, or reconcile the posted ledger
    -- ``update_transfer``'s tail owns all three, so a settle and an ordinary
    edit reconcile through one statement.

    Args:
        rows: The transfer, at its pre-settle status.  The figure is resolved
            from the EXPENSE leg; either would answer the same (both price the
            one parent, and both sides carry the same record), and naming one
            means the choice is not made twice.
        new_status_id: The settled status all three rows move to, as the DOOR
            asked for it.  Verified by
            :func:`~app.services.transfer_service._status.apply_status_to_all_three`.
        submitted: The figure a caller stated and who wrote it
            (:class:`~app.services.stated_figure.StatedFigure`; every caller
            today is a person's door, so ``typed``), or ``None`` when nobody
            stated one.
        stated: The days the caller states, by side
            (:class:`~app.services.transfer_service._side_days.PairDays`) --
            the reconcile tick's statement day on the ``asserted`` basis, the
            matcher's bank day on ``observed``, each for the side on the
            statement's account.  A settle entering the band admits every
            stated day.  Empty derives both: each side borrows the owner's
            today, as a Paid press does.
        press: The save's press, or ``None`` when its door named nothing:
            a ``$0.00`` figure takes each leg's kept payment off
            the books, and the act asks (ruling **R-CC127**;
            :func:`~._status.apply_status_to_all_three`).

    Returns:
        Whether this settle booked a figure the caller supplied NOW -- what the
        reconcile writer counts (finding **N-231**).  Answered by the act itself
        rather than by a predicate the caller asks separately, so the count and
        the write cannot disagree and the figure is resolved once per settle
        instead of once per asker.  ``False`` for a settle that honoured a
        RETAINED correction: nobody typed anything at this tick, and the count
        is of what this tick's user did.

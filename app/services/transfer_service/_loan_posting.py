Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service loan posting wiring

The genesis-ledger glue for :mod:`app.services.transfer_service`: the helpers
that re-reconcile a loan's full posting ledger -- the confirmed-payment split
corrections AND the opening / true-up anchor corrections
(:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service`) -- whenever a transfer mutation
settles, reverts, edits, restores, or deletes a loan payment.

Extracted from ``transfer_service`` so that module stays under the 1000-line
module limit as the loan-posting wiring lands -- the same split that moved the
ownership loaders into ``_ownership``.  These helpers are a cohesive,
transfer-service-private cluster (single responsibility: keep the loan's genesis
ledger in step with a transfer mutation), routing every call through
:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service` so ``transfer_service`` itself carries
no loan-posting knowledge.  Flask-isolated like the parent service: plain data
in, ORM objects or plain values out, no ``request`` / ``session``.

A loan payment is a Transfer whose ``to_account`` is an amortizing loan
(:func:`_pays_a_loan`, the ONE spelling).  Its split correction links no row
(ruling **R-BAL102**, plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``): it is keyed by the
payment's period and visible day on the loan's own chart rows, so a delete or
an endpoint move owes it NO reversal first -- the loan sync the door runs
AFTER finds the vacated key with no target and reverses it.  Every loan
correction -- payment splits and anchor corrections alike -- touches only the
loan's own ledgers, never Checking, so it is invisible to the cash path.

    Ruling R-C (plan step C9b).  A loan cannot receive a payment before it
    exists, and the reason is not tidiness -- such a payment is ERASED, silently:

    * the fold orders events by installment and applies each anchor as a RESET,
      with a payment sorting BEFORE an anchor on a shared date, so a payment due
      at or before origination splits against a running balance of ZERO.
      The ONE allocation's closed-loan arm
      (``app.utils.money.apply_payment_cash``) routes the entire cash to
      ``excess`` -- measured $0.00 interest, $0.00 principal, $1,200.00 to a
      Refund Receivable -- and the origination anchor then resets the balance to
      the full principal over the top of it.
    * meanwhile the cash side debits the funding account in full.

    So the money leaves checking, the loan is untouched, and the app models the
    lender as owing it back.  The developer ruled this REJECTED at the write
    boundary rather than modeled as a prepayment (which is a feature) or left to
    fail loud on read (which would 500 a page for data the user was allowed to
    enter).

    **The boundary is ``<=``, not ``<``, and it is stated ONCE**
    (:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.precedes_origination`, since plan step
    R16-b-2, which asks it of every occurrence the forward plan estimates so
    the plan never prices a row this guard would refuse).  A payment due
    exactly ON the origination date is subsumed by that anchor's reset -- the
    same strict ``anchor_date < due_date`` post-anchor rule
    (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.replay_loan_events`) -- so it
    is erased identically.  Swept and measured: due 02-01, 02-28 and 03-01
    against a 03-01 origination all book $0.00 principal; 03-02 pays down
    $366.67.

    :func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.installment_for`, so the guard refuses
    exactly the payments the fold would erase -- including one carrying NO
    ``due_date``, whose installment comes from its pay-period start (an ad-hoc
    transfer into a loan, which is how the shape was originally found).

    A payment due AFTER origination but before the first contractual installment
    is deliberately ALLOWED: an early extra payment is legitimate and the fold
    splits it correctly against the opening balance.  This guard is about the
    loan's EXISTENCE; the recurrence ``start_date`` bound (C9a) is what keeps
    generated installments on the contract.

    A no-op for a non-loan destination and for an amortizing account with no
    :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams` yet (nothing to compare against
    -- ``classify_account`` reads the account TYPE only, so a Mortgage-typed
    account can be unconfigured).

    just resolved -- and a ``None`` arm underneath it that had to explain why
    it stayed silent about a row the caller would refuse anyway.  Taking the

    moving a transfer between periods: 21 statements before that step, 23

    re-placing rule this leaf adds needs the same paycheck a third time, and
    three walks for one value is the shape the developer's DRY rule names
    (one producer per request, threaded), so ``._update`` resolves it ONCE --

    now, ahead of this guard, for the reason this guard used to do it: it
    reads that period's ``start_date`` as the installment fallback, and an
    unowned row answering it would return a 400 carrying a date derived from
    it where the security-response rule requires an indistinguishable 404.
    **The destination account is the caller's already-owned value for the
    same reason** (plan step R10-b): the guard names that account in its
    refusal message, so resolving an unowned id here would answer a
    cross-user probe with that account's NAME.

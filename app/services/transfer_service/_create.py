"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service: the CREATE verb

The one path that brings a transfer into existence, and the
:class:`TransferSpec` value that describes one such request.

**A transfer is ONE row since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``** (ruling
**R-BAL166**).  This door also built two twin
:class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` rows per transfer, one on each
account, until then; since ``X-bi-6-4d-2`` nothing read a twin's status or
day, each side's payment hangs off the transfer by its side link
(``transaction_entries.expense_transfer_id`` / ``income_transfer_id``), and
that step's migration deleted the rows the door had built.

**This leaf is the ONE holder of the W9907 status allowlist entry.**  The
write it makes is a CONSTRUCTOR write -- ``Transfer(status_id=...)`` in
:func:`create_transfer` -- which the status fence exempts by naming this
module.  Every other status write in the package goes through
:func:`app.services.status_seam.apply_status_change`
(:mod:`app.services.transfer_service._status`), so the allowlist stops at
this file rather than covering the package.  Plan step X-aj2 makes the write
door structural and deletes the entry.

Flask-isolated like the rest of the package: plain data in, ORM rows out, no
``request`` / ``session`` imports.  Flushes; does NOT commit.

    """The canonical inputs for creating a transfer.

    Bundles the thirteen fields :func:`create_transfer` needs into one
    cohesive value object so the sole transfer-creation path takes a
    single argument rather than a thirteen-field signature.  Every field
    is read by ``create_transfer`` and supplied together by every caller
    (the new-transfer route, the recurrence engine, the materialize path)
    -- this is one "transfer to create" request, mirroring the columns
    of the ``Transfer`` row it produces.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (13/7) -- these are the
    irreducible inputs of one creation request, read as a flat unit by
    the single consumer; there is NO cohesive sub-group to nest, so
    splitting would fragment one concept for no gain.  Mirrors the
    ``AmortizationRow`` / ``PayoffScenarios`` precedent.  Frozen so a
    constructed spec is an immutable record of one request.

    Attributes:
        user_id: Owner of the transfer.
        from_account_id: Account money leaves (expense side).
        to_account_id: Account money enters (income side).
        pay_period_id: Pay period for the transfer.
        scenario_id: Budget scenario.
        amount_ownership: WHAT PRICES this transfer, as ONE value (ruling
            **R-BAL11**, plan step X-au-f): an
            :class:`~app.models.amount_ownership.AmountOwnership` that either
            OWNS a positive figure -- an ad-hoc transfer, or one an operator
            priced -- or DECLARES
            :attr:`~app.enums.AmountSourceEnum.TEMPLATE`, meaning its
            definition's effective-dated series prices it as of its own due
            date.  It was a bare ``amount: Decimal`` until that step, which
            could express only the first: a create door that cannot say *this
            row is priced by its definition* has to write a figure and let a
            later writer take it back, and the row is OWN in between.
        status_id: Initial status, outside the settled band: every app
            door creates Projected.  A settled status is refused (ruling
            **R-BAL379**): a transfer becomes settled only through the settle
            verb, after it exists.
        category_id: Optional spending category.  May be None.
        notes: Optional notes on the transfer.
        transfer_template_id: Optional link to the generating transfer
            template (for recurrence).
        name: Optional display name.  If None, generated from the
            account names.
        due_date: Optional due date stored on the transfer.
        occurs_on: WHICH OCCURRENCE this transfer answers: the day its
            template's cadence named (the transfer recurrence engine), or its
            own due date for a ONE-TIME transfer (the one-time branch of
            ``routes/transfers/_instances``, since plan step
            ``balance:X-ci-1``, ruling **R-BAL94**); ``None`` only for an
            ad-hoc transfer, which no definition placed.

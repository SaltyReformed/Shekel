"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service validate-and-load guards

The input-validation and entity-loading guards for
:mod:`app.services.transfer_service`: validate a submitted amount, refuse a
transfer OUT of a source no engine models one from (the composed loan-or-card
set both doors call), load the owned/active
:class:`~app.models.transfer.Transfer` a mutation writes, and refuse a
restore onto an archived account.
Each is a precondition check the mutation entry points run before they touch
any row, raising the project's domain exceptions
(:class:`~app.exceptions.ValidationError` for a bad amount or a restore onto
an archived account, :class:`~app.exceptions.NotFoundError` for a missing or
not-yours transfer -- with an identical message for both the "missing" and
the "not yours" case, the project security-response rule -- no existence
oracle).

Extracted from ``transfer_service`` so that module stays under the 1000-line
module limit as the Build-Order Step 2-4 posting-ledger wiring lands -- the
same split that moved the ownership loaders into ``_ownership`` and
the loan-posting glue into ``_loan_posting``.  :func:`assert_restorable`
joined them at plan step X-aj1 (ruling **R-DR**), bringing ``restore_transfer``'s
preconditions to the module whose single responsibility they already were.

These helpers plus :class:`TransferRows` are a cohesive,
transfer-service-private cluster (single responsibility: validate inputs and
load the rows a mutation operates on).  They write no ``status_id``
and construct no ``Transaction`` -- so they stay clear of the W9907 status fence
that keeps the status-mirroring appliers in the parent module -- and they
compute no balance.
Flask-isolated like the parent service: plain data in, ORM objects out, no
``request`` / ``session`` imports.

    Introduced at plan step X-f2-c3 as Transfer Invariant 1 as a TYPE -- a
    parent and exactly two shadow transactions, whose statuses and periods
    were kept equal -- because threading the three through the settle's
    signature put it over pylint's argument ceiling, and a call site that
    could pair one transfer with another's shadows could break the invariant
    by typo.  The same reasoning
    :class:`app.services.reconcile_service._rows.Statement` is built on.

    **It holds ONE row since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``**, which
    deleted the twin rows and made the database refuse a new one (rulings
    **R-BAL166**, **R-BAL258**).  The twins had been mirrors and nothing more
    since ``X-bi-6-4d-2``: a transfer's status and settled figure are its
    own columns, and each side's day is its payment record's, hung off the
    transfer by a side link.  The step's leaf 3b deleted the
    ``shadows`` attribute, the loader that queried the twins
    (``load_transfer_rows``) and the arms of ``_update``, ``_amount`` and
    ``_endpoints`` that wrote the mirrors over them.  What the value still

        The settle and the update read what a pair RECORDS through its
        expense leg -- the retained correction a re-settle honours, the record
        it carries forward, the figure an echoed Actual box is compared
        against, each read off the leg's TRANSFER, the settled figure's one
        home (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``) -- and since leaf
        ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-1`` they read it here, through
        :func:`app.services.transfer_legs.transfer_side_leg`, rather than off
        the expense shadow's ``entries``: ``transfer_legs`` holds the one join
        ``X-bi-6-4d``'s re-parent moves, so this read moves with it.  The
        leg's status is its TRANSFER's.  It is read by SIDE, never by the transfer's
        current account, because an endpoint move earlier in the same act
        leaves ``from_account_id`` stale until a flush (see the producer).

        **Read ONCE per act and kept**, so the grade, the settle and the
        correction of one update ask one query between them: a producer asked
        twice in one request is two resolution points, which can come to
        disagree about WHEN they resolved.
        That is correct because every reader asks BEFORE the act's seam pass,
        and asks only for its TRANSFER's facts -- the status and soft delete,
        the settled figure and its source, and what the transfer resolves to
        -- which the leg reads off the live transfer at each asking; none asks
        for the leg's ``record``, which the read freezes (an endpoint move
        carries it to the new endpoint and may re-date it ``borrowed``, ruling
        **R-BAL168**).  A reader of the record AFTER the seam pass would not
        see the act's own write consistently (a first settle's new record is
        absent from the cached value; a kept one is the same object, re-dated
        in place), so none may be added there.  **Its ``account_id`` is
        frozen at the read**, too, and an act may move an endpoint around
        that read: when a figure is
        graded the read precedes the move (``_update._grade_submitted_figure``
        runs ahead of ``_endpoints._apply_endpoint_move``) and names the OLD
        source after it; otherwise the first read is the settle's, after the
        move has flushed, and names the NEW source.  Either way nothing may
        read this leg's account: every
        reader reads through its ``transfer``, and one that needs the side's
        account reads the transfer's.

    3.8, plan step ``credit_card:CC-10``).  The card's whole model rests on
    money leaving it ONLY as a purchase -- a movement on the card (3.2) -- and
    a transfer touching it only as its PAYMENT, into it (3.5): the statement's
    grace test is graded on the credits INTO the card

    prices one APR per date (``budget.rate_history`` through
    :func:`app.services.card_apr.apr_in_effect`) over the balance path (3.6).
    A cash advance carries its own APR, a fee and no grace, which one APR row
    per date and one grace rule cannot express, so admitting it would price
    every later statement of that card wrong -- the same reason a disbursement

    past it -- and neither door names this function.  Both call
    :func:`_reject_unmodeled_source`, the ONE set of source refusals, so a
    door cannot hold the loan's refusal and miss the card's.

    **It lives here, not beside the loan refusal in** :mod:`._loan_posting`,
    because that module's responsibility is the loan's genesis-ledger glue and

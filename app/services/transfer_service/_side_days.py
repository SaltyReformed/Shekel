Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service: EACH SIDE'S OWN DAY

A transfer leaves one account and arrives at another, and since plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3`` each side keeps its own "money moved on" day with a
basis saying how that day is known (ruling **R-BAL142**, amending **R-BAL89**).
A side with evidence of its own -- the bank showed it (``observed``), a balance
was asserted over it (``asserted``), or the owner typed it (``entered``) --
keeps that day.  A side with none BORROWS its other side's day, so it follows
when that day is corrected (``borrowed``); when neither side has one, both
borrow the day Paid was pressed.

This leaf is the whole derivation, and it is PURE: values in, values out, no
session, no clock (the writer reads ``display_today()`` once and passes it).
Three names carry the three rules, so each has ONE home:

* :func:`~app.services.settle_day.is_evidence` -- whether a day is the side's
  own (the REC-552 study's seam S1; it lives beside ``SettleDay`` because the
  status seam asks it too);
* :func:`borrowed_day` -- the day a side with no evidence takes (seam S6: every
  writer that derives a borrowed day reaches it through :func:`resolve_pair_days`,
  never an inline computation);
* :func:`resolve_pair_days` -- both sides at once, the rule itself.

:class:`SideDay` is what a door STATES ("the money moved on THIS account on
this day, known this way"), and :func:`stated_by_side` turns the doors' account
view into the writer's side view once, before any write.  The ONE writer is
:func:`app.services.transfer_service._status.apply_status_to_all_three`, with
the born-settled create's identity writer beside it; both call
:func:`resolve_pair_days`.

Through the interval each side's current day is read off its SHADOW -- the row
the status seam writes, and the only home of a ``$0.00`` close's day -- and
plan step ``X-bi-6-4d`` re-plumbs that input to the movements when the shadows
go.  Nothing here reads either.

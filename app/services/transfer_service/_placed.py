Shekel Budget App -- Transfer Service: what a MOVE means for a PLACED transfer

A one-time transfer is a rule-less definition plus the one transfer it PLACED
(:attr:`~app.models.transfer.Transfer.is_placed`, plan step ``balance:X-ci-1``).
The transaction side states what a move and a date mean for such a row in
:mod:`app.services.one_off` and applies it at its two doors, because a
transaction has no service door of its own; a transfer HAS one --
:func:`~app.services.transfer_service.update_transfer`, the door every mover
passes through (Transfer Invariant 4) -- so the rules are applied INSIDE it
(ruling **R-BAL96**): no door, present or future, can move a placed transfer
without re-placing it, and none can date one without its occurrence following.
The two rules themselves are the transaction twin's, stated once there and
reused as they are:

* **A period move RE-PLACES the transfer** (ruling **R-BAL93**, the twin of
  **R-BAL33**): moved to another paycheck it is due on that paycheck's start
  unless its date was not its old paycheck's start -- an owner-stated day,
  read by position -- which is :func:`one_off.due_date_after_move`, taking
  plain dates and the target :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod`.
  For a one-time payment INTO A LOAN the due date is the installment it
  satisfies, so the re-placed date is graded by the loan-installment guard
  exactly as a hand-typed one is (it reads ``updates["due_date"]``, which
  :func:`re_place_on_move` has written by then).
* **The transfer records its own due date as the occurrence it answers**
  (ruling **R-BAL94**, the twin of **R-BAL25**): ``occurs_on = due_date``,
  written at birth (``routes/transfers/_instances``) and by
  :func:`~._update._apply_remaining_fields`' one due-date arm, so the two
  columns cannot part.  A one-time transfer answered NO occurrence until this
  leaf -- the shape finding **REC-516** names the one-time branch as the
  last writer of -- which is what ``recurrence:R19-b`` waited on for this
  table.
* **A typed figure RESTATES the definition's price in place, inside the
  door** (ruling **R-BAL92**; **R-BAL96** as amended 2026-09-21 after this
  leaf's adversarial review): the popover sends the figure a human typed as
  ``definition_price=`` -- an explicit act, distinct from ``amount_ownership``
  so that value keeps its one meaning (**R-BAL11**) -- and
  :func:`restate_definition_price` corrects the version the transfer's FINAL
  due date reads (after the re-placing, the twin of ``one_off.restate_price``),
  declares all three rows definition-priced and clears the flag (**R-BAL37**'s
  heal), all BEFORE the settle dispatch.  As first built the popover restated
  after the door had run, and a figure typed beside Status = Paid booked the
  pre-restate price on both legs, `$50.00` wrong on each account in the
  worked case: the settle is the door's, so the restate had to be too.

* **Two placed transfers of one definition never answer one day**
  (:func:`reject_a_day_another_row_answers`): the occurrence index
  ``idx_transfers_template_scenario_occurrence`` is unique on ``(template,
  scenario, occurs_on)`` over live rows, and a date write that would collide
  is refused as a designed :class:`~app.exceptions.ValidationError` -- a
  sentence the popover renders -- rather than met as an ``IntegrityError``
  the route answers with *Invalid reference*.  A cleared cadence's survivors
  are the rows this can happen to: several transfers, one definition, each
  answering the occurrence the cadence named.  It is the TRANSFER table's
  statement of the predicate ``one_off.another_row_answers`` states for the
  transaction table -- two indexes over two tables whose definition columns
  differ by name (``template_id`` / ``transfer_template_id``), so one body
  parameterised on the model would need the column registry plan step
  X-au-k deleted; two twins, one per index, is the honest shape.  **No
  per-paycheck refusal is twinned**: ``one_off.holds_a_row_in`` states
  **R-BAL24**'s one-row-per-paycheck rule for a bank-born envelope's
  definition, which no transfer definition is; the paycheck-keyed indexes on
  this table cover UNDATED rows (``..._undated``) and template-less rows
  (``uq_transfers_adhoc_dedupe``), neither of which a placed transfer is.

Flask-isolated like the rest of the package: ORM rows and plain data in,
``updates`` mutated in place, no flush or commit of its own.  Reading the
source paycheck is a lazy load, which may autoflush pending writes; every
caller runs this before the first write.

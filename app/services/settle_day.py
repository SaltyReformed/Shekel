"""
Shekel Budget App -- The settle DAY and how it is known

WHEN a row's money moved and HOW that day is known, as ONE value (plan step
**X-az**, finding **N-332**).  ``settled_on`` alone carried three different
kinds of fact -- a day the bank showed, a day a balance was asserted for, and a
day the owner typed -- and nothing on the row said which, so the statement
matcher told them apart by testing whether ``reconciled_by_id`` was populated.

**It is a VALUE TYPE rather than a second parameter, and that placement is the
whole structural half of this step.**  :class:`~app.services.status_seam.Settlement`
is its twin one column over: the figure and its basis are one fact, so they
travel as one value and a door cannot build a malformed pair to hand over.  A
loose ``settled_day_basis`` parameter beside ``settled_on`` would be two facts
with a default between them -- and a default is exactly how a caller silently
records the wrong provenance.  With one value there is no default to get wrong:
a door that knows a day states how it knows it, or it passes nothing at all.

**Why a shared leaf rather than a home in either door's package.**  Both
``budget.transactions`` and ``budget.transaction_entries`` carry the pair, and
their write doors are in different packages -- ``status_seam`` owns the
transaction column and ``entry_service`` owns the purchase one.  Neither owns
both, so a value type living in either would make the other import a package it
has no other business with.

Pure: a frozen value, one ``ref_cache`` lookup, and two functions that read or
write a row's two columns.  No session, no commit, no Flask.

    evidence, so whatever evidence the row already recorded still stands.  A day
    that DID move is a fresh assertion by the person who typed it, and
    ``entered`` is exactly what that is.

    **A door with real EVIDENCE does not come through here.**  The statement
    matcher confirms a day it has a bank line for and states ``observed``
    directly (``statement_match._accept._apply_day``), which is how an
    ``asserted`` bound the bank agrees with is raised rather than frozen.  The

    other re-posted a form.

        submitted_day: The civil day the form submitted.  Never ``None`` -- a
            submission with no day is not a statement about one, and each door

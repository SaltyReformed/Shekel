    """Carry forward all projected items from source to target period.

    Steps:
      1. Verify both periods are in the owner's pay calendar.
      2. Find every non-deleted, projected transaction in the source
         period that belongs to the specified scenario.
      3. Partition into shadow / envelope / discrete buckets.
      4. Apply each bucket's semantic (settle-and-roll for envelope,
         move-whole for discrete, ``transfer_service`` for shadows).
      5. Return the count of carried items (envelope settle counts
         as 1; discrete move counts as 1; each transfer counts as 1
         regardless of its two shadow rows).

    The caller (typically the carry-forward route) is responsible for
    committing the surrounding transaction.  This service does not
    commit.  It does flush at the end so the route can immediately
    issue follow-up queries.

    Args:
        source_period_id: The pay_period.id to carry forward FROM.
        target_period_id: The pay_period.id to carry forward TO.
            Typically the user's current period.
        scenario_id: The scenario to carry forward within.  Prevents
            cross-scenario data corruption when multiple scenarios
            exist for the same user.
        balance_ctx: The request's
            :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`, opened once by
            the route and threaded down (pay-calendar plan step C2-f3c; plan
            step R7d-c-1 moved it from the calendar to the pass that derives
            one).  It names the owner, so no ``user_id`` rides beside it, and
            a period id that is not in its calendar is not this owner's --
            which is how both periods are ownership-checked.

    Returns:
        int -- the number of carried items (1 per source row processed).

    Raises:
        NotFoundError: If either period is not in *balance_ctx*'s calendar --
            it does not exist, or it is not this owner's.
        ValidationError: On four conditions, any of which fails the WHOLE
            batch -- the caller must rollback the session before issuing any
            follow-up writes.  (a) The envelope branch's ``AMBIGUOUS`` guard: a
            destination period with more than one mutable row for the same
            (template, scenario), a corrupt pre-existing state.  All other
            former block conditions (inactive template, finalised or
            soft-deleted destination) now create a fresh override row instead.
            (c) The envelope branch's ``CLOSED`` guard and (d) the discrete
            branch's twin of it (ruling **R-BAL44**, leaf 7b-3): a rule-less
            definition's row carried into a paycheck that already holds a
            row of it, or whose leftover would answer a day a row of it
            answers.
            (b) Since plan step C9b, a carried TRANSFER that is a loan payment
            whose destination period would place its installment at or before
            the loan's origination (``transfer_service.update_transfer``
            enforces ruling R-C on the period move).  The refusal itself is
            correct -- the moved payment would be erased by the fold -- but it
            costs the rest of the batch, which is recorded as a finding rather
            than fixed here: making it skip-and-report is a behaviour change to
            carry-forward's batch semantics, not to the guard.

    date, so every re-placed row takes the target's start.  Found by

    leaf, and this arm moved the period alone, so a one-off rolled to

    paycheck, and one carried INTO a paycheck holding its sibling met
    the occurrence index (found by 7b-3's adversarial review; finding

    envelope branch's CLOSED does, where the target already holds a row
    of the definition (``one_off.holds_a_row_in``).  A linked row
    always carries a due date

    """Settle an envelope source row and roll its leftover into the target.

    Implements the envelope branch of Option F (see
    ``docs/carry-forward-aftermath-design.md``):

      1. Compute ``entries_sum`` as ``sum(e.amount for e in
         source.purchases)`` -- the row's purchases, never a covering
         movement a revert kept (ruling **R-BAL68**).  No purchases ->
         ``Decimal("0")`` so the full estimated amount rolls forward.
      2. Compute ``leftover = max(Decimal("0"), <the source's RESOLVED
         amount> - entries_sum)``.  Overspend (``entries_sum > budget``)
         clamps to zero -- the actual overspend is recorded on the
         settled source row's settlement record and on its entries.
      3. If ``leftover > 0``, resolve the destination row via
         ``_resolve_or_create_target_row``, which (a) bumps the single
         mutable (Projected) row for ``(template_id, target period,
         scenario_id)`` when one exists, (b) lets
         ``recurrence_engine.generate_for_template`` create the canonical
         when the destination is empty and the template is active there,
         or (c) creates a fresh ``is_override`` row carrying the leftover
         when neither applies (an inactive template, or a destination
         whose only row is finalised or soft-deleted).
         Then bump the resolved row: its own resolved amount plus the
         leftover becomes the row's OWNERSHIP through
         ``amount_ownership.state_own_amount`` -- one act over one attribute
         since plan step X-au-k, where it was a figure write and a separate
         source clear whose PAIRING the CHECK had to catch -- and
         ``is_override`` flips ``True``.  The flip blocks future
         recurrence-engine passes from regenerating the row (verified by
         the ``is_override`` skip clause in
         ``app/services/recurrence_engine.py``).  A freshly created row
         starts at ``Decimal("0")`` so the bump lands it on exactly the
         leftover.  The only refusal is the ``AMBIGUOUS`` guard -- more
         than one mutable destination row, a corrupt pre-existing state.
      4. Settle the source row via
         ``transaction_service.settle_from_entries``.  The helper
         enforces its own preconditions (envelope template,
         non-deleted, mutable status, no transfer_id), all of which
         are already guaranteed by the partitioning in
         ``carry_forward_unpaid``.

    Mutations land on ``source_txn`` and the target row in place; the
    caller owns the session/commit lifecycle.  Two flushes can happen here:
    ``recurrence_engine.generate_for_template``'s, when it has to create a
    canonical, and ``one_off.place_row_of``'s, when a rule-less
    definition's leftover row is placed (ruling **R-BAL44**) -- the
    recurring ``CREATE`` branch only ``db.session.add``s.  Both are
    acceptable inside the surrounding ``no_autoflush`` block: an
    ``is_override`` row is index-safe in every intermediate state, and a
    placed row is written only after ``CLOSED`` has refused the states it
    could collide with.

    Args:
        source_txn: A Projected, non-deleted, envelope-tracked transaction of
            a DEFINITION (recurring, or rule-less since ruling **R-BAL44**) in
            the source period.  Partitioning in ``carry_forward_unpaid``
            guarantees the preconditions.

            Passed pre-fetched to avoid a redundant lookup; the
            caller already validated ownership.
        basis: The request's :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis`
            (``ctx.basis``).  Its ``scenario_id`` scopes the target-row lookup
            and the recurrence-engine call so cross-scenario data is never
            touched, and it prices both ends of the rollover.

    **The date the definition's own rule gives for that paycheck** (developer
    ruling 2026-09-06, from the option space this leaf put to them; the balance
    arc's ruling id for it is reserved and NOT YET MINTED, so this cites the
    ruling by date rather than by an id that does not resolve).  It goes
    through :func:`~app.services.recurrence.compute_due_date`, the one
    producer of "what date does a row of this definition in this period carry"
    -- shared with the transaction engine (``_amounts._derive_row_fields``)
    and the transfer engine (``transfer_recurrence``), the two that outlive
    this step.  *Two more callers were claimed here and never were*:
    ``routes/transfers/_instances`` stopped calling it at plan step R2e-3, and
    migration ``48e2c7ee593d`` froze a COPY of it rather than importing it.
    The one-time ``occurs_on`` backfill script was a third caller as this was
    written and is deliberately not listed: it is retired (2026-09-06) by the
    step that merges immediately BEFORE this one, precisely BECAUSE this change
    breaks the provenance filter it read a leftover row's missing date as.

    A leftover row is therefore dated exactly as a row generation placed in
    that paycheck would be -- defect and all: ledger row **recurrence:D18** is
    that ``compute_due_date`` picks the wrong month at a cadence whose firing
    month is neither of the paycheck's endpoints, and plan step
    **recurrence:R5** fixes that for every caller at once.  Deriving a "better"
    date here would be a second spelling of one value (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14)
    that R5 would then have to find.

    **On the branch that owns this constructor the answer is a
    COUNTERFACTUAL, and calling it "the definition's own date" would overstate
    it.**  ``_create_target_override_row`` runs when the engine will NOT
    generate here -- the yearly Father's Day envelope rolling into an
    off-anniversary paycheck -- so there is no occurrence in this period for
    the rule to date.  ``compute_due_date`` is a pure function of
    ``(rule, period)`` and answers anyway, falling back to the rule's day of
    month in the month the paycheck opens in, which can land outside the
    paycheck entirely.  That is the price of one producer over a second
    spelling, and it is deliberate: ``attribution_day`` clamps such a date back
    into the period, so no period total and no period-end balance moves.

    **Why the row is dated at all**, where it carried ``None`` until this step:
    a row that names a recurring definition can be handed BACK to it -- that is
    what ``recurrence_engine.resolve_conflicts``'s "use the template's amount"
    does -- and a row priced by its definition resolves the series on its OWN
    due date (amount rule 3).  An undated one is therefore unpriceable the
    moment the owner presses that button, and ``AmountUnresolvable`` has no
    handler on the grid, dashboard or companion path.  Reproduced against the
    pre-fix producer, which is what
    ``TestACarriedForwardLeftoverRowIsDated`` grades.

    **The defect was live and UNREALISED**, measured 2026-09-06 rather than
    assumed: zero rows carried ``template_id`` with a NULL ``due_date`` on the
    dev database or on the 1034-row production clone, so nothing in the data
    needed repairing and this step owes no backfill.

    *The reason the old ``None`` gave does not carry over.*  It was that
    copying the SOURCE row's date -- a past period's -- would render the new
    row overdue.  True, and this is not that: ``compute_due_date`` is anchored
    on the TARGET period, so the day it answers is at worst a few days outside
    that paycheck rather than a whole rollover behind it.

    **WHAT MOVED, traced rather than assumed.**  No figure changes and no
    period total moves, because every consumer that places a row on a DAY goes
    through ``DerivedPeriod.attribution_day``, which falls back to the period's
    start for a dateless row and clamps a dated one into the period -- so the
    two cases meet at the same day whenever the computed date lands outside.
    Four surfaces do read the date and now behave differently for these rows,
    and each is the leftover behaving like the canonical it stands in for:
    ``reconcile_service._rows`` offers it from its due day rather than from the
    period's start; ``balance_at._cash_fold`` steps the intra-period daily ramp
    on that day; ``dashboard_service._pulse`` gives it a day on the street axis
    instead of the "anytime this period" shelf; and
    ``grid_view_service.due_captions_by_key`` renders a caption where it
    rendered none.

    **It reads the definition's rule with no ``None`` arm since plan step
    balance:X-bi-7a.**  An arm dated a CLEARED cadence's leftover row from the
    paycheck's start, because such a definition's rows used to take the
    rollover; the context routes a row here only when its definition
    ``recurs`` now (ruling **R-BAL20**), so a rule-less definition's row moves
    whole and never reaches this function.  The arm was unreachable, and an
    unreachable arm with a reason attached is a sentence the code contradicts.

def _create_target_override_row(source_txn, target_period, scenario_id):
    """Create a fresh override row in *target_period* for the leftover.

    Used for a RECURRING definition when no mutable destination row exists
    to top up and the recurrence engine will not generate one -- e.g. a
    yearly Father's Day envelope rolling into an off-anniversary period, or
    a destination whose only row is finalised or soft-deleted (a RULE-LESS
    definition's leftover row is placed by ``one_off.place_row_of`` instead,
    ruling **R-BAL44**).  The row is created at
    ``Decimal("0")``; the caller folds the leftover on top via the same
    bump every branch uses, so the row ends at exactly the leftover
    amount.

    The row copies its identity (account, template, name, category, type)
    from *source_txn* and is flagged ``is_override = True`` so (a) it is
    excluded from both partial unique generation indexes and never
    collides with a canonical or soft-deleted sibling, and (b) the recurrence engine
    skips it on later passes (``_recurrence_common.OccurrenceClaims`` -- a row
    answering no OCCURRENCE claims its whole paycheck).  ``template_id`` is
    copied verbatim, and ``due_date`` is :func:`_leftover_due_date` -- the day
    the definition's own rule places in *target_period*, which is what makes
    the copied link safe to hand back to (see that function).  It was ``None``
    until the developer's ruling of 2026-09-06.

    **``occurs_on`` and ``due_date`` are different facts and only the second
    moved.**  The occurrence is which firing of the cadence a row answers, and
    this constructor still leaves it unset; the due date is the day the money
    is owed, and amount rule 3 resolves the definition's price series on it.
    Both partial unique generation indexes are keyed on ``occurs_on``, and the
    undated one excludes ``is_override`` rows besides, so no UNIQUE index
    reads ``due_date`` and dating the row can collide with nothing.  The one
    CHECK that reads it, ``ck_transactions_template_row_needs_due_date`` (plan
    step X-bv-2), REQUIRES a linked row to be dated, which is what this
    constructor now does; it is the reason an undated leftover cannot be
    written any more, not a collision.  It is not true that the column is in
    no index at all -- these rows now enter ``idx_transactions_due_date``,
    which is non-unique and exists to serve range reads.

    No flush: the caller runs inside ``carry_forward_unpaid``'s
    ``no_autoflush`` block and an ``is_override`` row is index-safe in
    every intermediate state.

    Args:
        source_txn: The envelope source row whose identity is copied.
        target_period: The destination
            :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod`.
        scenario_id: Scenario the new row belongs to.

    Returns:
        The newly added (unflushed) Transaction.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Anchor True-up Service

Single authoritative implementation of the anchor true-up mutation
for every account kind that carries an append-only anchor history:
checking accounts via :class:`AccountAnchorHistory` here, and loan
accounts via :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` in
:mod:`app.services.loan_anchor_service` (E-18 / Commit 16, decision
D-C; the loan half moved there at plan step ``recurrence:R20`` when
its third door crossed the module line ceiling -- the seam this
docstring always drew).  Both call sites switch on the same
:class:`AnchorTrueUpOutcome` enum so the route layer's response
composition is uniform; the cash door carries it inside an
:class:`AnchorTrueUpReport` (ruling R-CC79).

The checking-anchor path -- :func:`apply_anchor_true_up` -- backs the
grid and Net Worth Cockpit HTMX anchor-edit endpoint (``true_up``).
Its transactional core:

  1. Append an ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row -- an account, a balance, and
     the day it was true.
  2. Commit.

**Step 3 used to be a bulk-clear of entry flags, and its deletion is ruling
R-DH (d)** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/archive/anchor_settle_partition.md``,
plan step S1-c).  A true-up flipped ``is_cleared = TRUE`` on every entry dated
on or before the SERVER's today, so whether a purchase counted as already
inside the asserted balance depended on the order two buttons were pressed:
record the purchase then true up and it cleared, true up then record and it
never did.  There is no flag to write now -- reconciliation is derived from the
purchase's own recorded posting day -- so the true-up appends one assertion
and nothing else.  It mutated ``accounts`` too until ruling R-EH deleted the
anchor cache columns (plan step X-f1c3c); the assertion IS the state now.
Confirming which outstanding purchases the
statement showed is a SEPARATE, user-driven step
(``reconcile_service.record_settled_days``) that the route offers after this commit
lands; keeping it out of this transaction is deliberate, because a same-day
re-assert is swallowed here as idempotent success and any reconciliation riding
along would be silently rolled back with it.

The loan-anchor path --
:func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service.apply_loan_anchor_true_up` -- backs
the loan dashboard's "Record loan balance as of date D" form.  It
shares the enum contract but operates on a different model and a
different mutation set:

  1. Append a ``user_trueup`` :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` row (the
     table is structurally append-only; no UPDATE/DELETE).
  2. Commit.

**Both paths are APPEND-ONLY now, and the checking path's optimistic lock
went with the columns** (ruling R-EN, plan step X-f1c3c).  The C-17
``version_id_col`` on ``Account`` raised ``StaleDataError`` when a concurrent
commit bumped the counter between a route's SELECT and its UPDATE -- but a
true-up no longer UPDATEs ``accounts`` at all, so there is no such flush and no
``STALE_CONFLICT`` outcome on either path.  No ASSERTION is lost by that: two
assertions of different balances are two FACTS, the later-observed one is
current, and neither is overwritten.  This is the contract the loan path has
documented since Commit 16, now shared.

**The posted LEDGER is a separate question, and the shared contract never
answered it.**  Both paths re-sync the ledger after appending, and a re-sync is
a reconcile-to-target: read what is posted, subtract, INSERT the difference.
Two of those interleaved both subtract the same posted state.  The cash side
had been serialised by accident (the deleted ``version_id`` UPDATE autoflushed
and took a row lock before the walk) and the loan side never was at all.  Plan
step X-f1c3c made the reconcile take a per-owner advisory lock for itself
(:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`); **since plan step ``balance:X-bn`` that
lock is held from the START of every writing transaction**
(:mod:`app.db_transaction`, ruling **R-CC115**), so the reconcile's read is
serialised before it runs and takes no lock of its own.

**An assertion is refused only when it CHANGES NOTHING, and that rule is this
module's** (ruling **R-EQ**, plan step X-f1c4b).  Both doors, under the owner's
write lock their transaction holds from its start, read the assertion that
currently GOVERNS what the submission would govern, and append only when the
submission differs from it.  An identical submission writes nothing and reports
``UNCHANGED``, which the routes render as success -- so a double-click, a
network retry and a back-and-resubmit are absorbed, while a correction never
is.

**Both doors carried a content-keyed UNIQUE INDEX for this until X-f1c4b, and
the index could not express the rule.**  ``uq_anchor_history_account_period_balance_day``
covered ``(account_id, anchor_balance, observed_on)`` and
``uq_loan_anchor_events_acct_date_bal_day`` covered ``(account_id, anchor_date,
anchor_balance, ((created_at AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::date))``; each write door
translated the violation into idempotent success.  **A transport retry and a
deliberate re-assertion are byte-identical by construction**, so a key over the
row's own values must mis-classify one of them -- and it mis-classified the
correction: assert ``$500`` for a day, correct it to ``$600``, then re-assert
``$500`` for that day, and the index rejected the third write while the app
reported it saved and kept rendering ``$600``.  Comparing against the governing
row instead is exact in both directions, because "did this change anything" is a
question about STATE, which the row's contents alone cannot answer.

Two consequences worth stating, both measured before the indexes were dropped:

  * **The remaining exposure is a surplus audit row, not money.**  Two truly
    concurrent identical submissions could each pass the compare -- except they
    cannot, because the compare runs under the per-owner write lock
    (:mod:`app.services.user_write_lock`), held since the transaction began
    (plan step ``balance:X-bn``), so the waiter reads the winner's row.  Even without
    it the cost was
    ``$0.00``: a duplicate assertion's correction delta is zero, a zero delta
    emits no legs (``account_posting_service._anchors``), and same-day
    corrections merge on one key.
  * *History, superseded by plan step ``balance:X-bn``, which takes the lock
    where each writing transaction begins and deleted every call below:*
    **The lock moved EARLIER, not merely inward, and the "first lock" property
    belonged to the CALLER.**  It was taken inside the reconcile, several
    statements in; both doors now take it before their first read.  That is only
    the invariant :mod:`app.services.user_write_lock` states ("this lock must be
    the FIRST lock a transaction takes") when nothing the caller did earlier has
    already taken a row lock -- and ``lock_user_writes`` runs through
    ``db.session.execute``, which AUTOFLUSHES, so a caller that assigns to an ORM
    row before calling here emits that ``UPDATE`` first and inverts the order
    silently.  The three HTMX/loan doors do only reads beforehand.
    ``routes/accounts/crud.update_account`` took the lock at its own top for the
    same reason, against a deadlock between two of its OWN branches reproduced
    against a real database; **plan step X-f1e deleted the branch that raced**,
    so that route no longer reaches this module at all and keeps the lock purely
    to hold the invariant on its type-change path.  **None of that closes
    finding N-193**, whose cycle is settle-versus-truncate and is untouched.

Pre-Commit-16 this consolidation eliminates two byte-identical
``try/except`` blocks in ``app/routes/accounts.py``; the loan
principal true-up (E-18) introduced by Commit 16 will extend this
service rather than paste a third copy.

Services boundary: no Flask imports, no ``request``/``session``/
``current_app``/``render_template``.  The route owns the response
rendering; this module returns what it decided -- an outcome enum, and on the
cash door the governing assertion either side of the write -- which the route
translates into its template/header pair.  The session itself is the project's
SQLAlchemy ``db.session`` proxy, which IS Flask-bound -- consistent
with every other service in ``app/services/`` (e.g. ``entry_service``,
``balance_resolver``).

**A cash balance is asserted at exactly ONE door, and that is plan step X-f1e**
(finding **N-195**).  ``routes/accounts/crud.update_account`` -- the full-form
account edit -- used to be a second one: it accepted an ``anchor_balance`` and
staged an assertion through :func:`stage_anchor_true_up`, sharing the definition
but not the DECISION.  The two answered the same submission differently, because
that form PRE-FILLS the current balance: saving a rename re-submitted it
unchanged, which the route read as "no change" while ruling R-EQ's rule here
reads a submission as new when it changes what GOVERNS, the day included.
Aligning the route on this module's rule would have been worse -- a rename would
then assert today's balance and absorb purchases the user never reconciled -- so
the SURFACE was deleted rather than the gate.  What remains is
:func:`apply_anchor_true_up`, reached from ``accounts.true_up`` on every screen
that shows a balance.

**And the TABLE now has one writer too, which is a different claim** (ruling
**R-ES**, plan step X-f1e2).  One door means one place a USER asserts a balance;
one writer means one place a ROW is appended, and until X-f1e2
``account_service.create_account`` was the second -- it constructed the
origination assertion itself, so that one row was written with no owner write
lock, no ruling R-EQ compare and no shared log line.  It calls
:func:`stage_anchor_true_up` now.  The ``notes`` column those two writers
existed to be told apart in went with the ruling: nothing in ``app/`` read it,
and it was a second definition of "the opening" beside the positional one
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.cash_anchor_facts` sets.

One consequence is worth stating where the rule lives: **the amortizing-kind
refusal is no longer duplicated at a route validator.**
``_validate_update_account`` carried its own copy because that door reached the
stager without passing :func:`apply_anchor_true_up`'s gate; with the door gone,
:class:`AmortizingAccountAnchorError` is raised in one place.

    **R-ER**, plan step X-f1c4c): the origination assertion
    (``account_service.create_account``) and every later one
    (:func:`stage_anchor_true_up`).  It lives in THIS module because this module
    owns what an assertion is.  It was ``account_service``'s private
    ``_reject_undatable_observation`` while the factory was its only caller, and
    a second module reaching a private name is finding **N-33**'s shape rather
    than a way to share a rule.

    **It RESOLVES and refuses in one call, which closes the DEFAULT's half of a
    clock race and does not pretend to close the other half.**  Both callers
    previously defaulted an absent day to ``display_today()`` and then handed
    the result to a guard that read the clock AGAIN -- so a midnight tick
    between the two lines could refuse the function's own default.  Reachable,
    if barely: for a user whose earliest pay period starts tomorrow the floor
    becomes tomorrow the instant the day rolls, and the default (today) is then
    below it.  ``account_service``'s note about that race considered only the
    future arm, where the ``>`` test is indeed forgiving, and missed the floor.
    An absent day now returns *today* directly, so that case is unrepresentable:
    today is assertable by construction -- it is not in the future, and the
    floor is ``min(earliest, today)``.

    *A first version of this paragraph claimed the fusion made the race
    unrepresentable outright.  A neutral review refuted it and the correction is
    kept here rather than dropped, because the residue is a real window:* both
    forms PREFILL today into their date box (``routes/accounts/anchor``'s
    ``observed_on_value``, ``templates/accounts/form.html``), so the ordinary
    path submits a SUPPLIED day and takes the branch below.  For that branch the
    input's bound was computed at RENDER time and this floor is read at SUBMIT
    time, so the window is minutes or hours rather than two adjacent statements.
    It bites only a schedule that is entirely in the future, it errs toward
    refusing rather than accepting, and the refusal is rendered in place
    (``accounts._anchor_editor_error``) rather than swallowed.

    ``observed_on`` is USER-SUPPLIED and it is not merely a label: it opens the
    modelled-return window (``balance_at._asset_fold._AccrualWindow``, which
    materialises EVERY calendar day from it to the reader's horizon) and it is
    the first period a payroll contribution can be modelled into
    (``_asset_contributions``).  An unbounded value is therefore both a
    correctness defect and a work amplifier: a Property or 401(k) asserted "as
    of" year 1 would fabricate contribution history for every past period and
    fold over three quarters of a million days on every dashboard render.

    Two bounds, and each refuses for its own reason:

    * **Not in the future.**  A balance cannot have been observed on a day the
      user has not seen.  The loan door states the same rule on a different
      clock, which is finding **N-197**.
    * **Not before the earlier of the schedule's start and today.**  The
      accrual-window reason above; the floor takes the EARLIER of the two so a
      user whose periods are all still in the future can nonetheless assert what
      they hold today.  The bound is
      :func:`app.services.pay_period_service.earliest_recordable_day`, the SAME
      floor ruling R-EL gave the settle door -- one implementation, so the
      anchor doors and the settle doors cannot drift apart on where recordable
      history begins.  **That is a claim about the FLOOR only.**  "Not in the
      future" is still stated in three modules with three messages and two
      clocks -- here, ``status_seam.reject_future_settle_day``, and
      ``schemas/validation/loans.LoanAnchorTrueupSchema`` on ``date.today()``
      (finding **N-197**) -- so this function did not reduce that count.

    **It does NOT refuse an owner with no pay periods, and that split is ruling
    R-ER.**  The rule it replaced did, on the stated ground that "the account's
    anchor has a period to reference" -- which ruling R-EO falsified by deleting
    ``account_anchor_history.pay_period_id``.  The live reason belongs to
    ACCOUNT CREATION rather than to a day (the opening's posting reconcile
    derives each correction's period from the owner's calendar, finding
    **N-192**), so it stays there as ``account_service``'s own precondition.
    Asking it here would have re-imposed on the true-up door exactly the refusal
    ruling R-EO deleted from it -- a balance the user typed, refused for want of
    a budgeting artifact that has nothing to do with what their bank holds --
    and would have answered a true-up with a message about creating an account.

    **The clock is the USER's** (ruling R-DH (b)).  ``display_today()``, never
    ``date.today()``: the process's UTC day is already tomorrow at 8pm Eastern,
    so the server's clock would refuse an assertion the user is making right
    now, and would default one made this evening to tomorrow.

    The flush-only in-memory core of :func:`apply_anchor_true_up`.  It does NOT
    clear past-dated entries and does NOT commit -- the caller owns the
    transaction.

    **It is the ONE writer of :class:`AccountAnchorHistory`, and that is ruling
    R-ES** (plan step X-f1e2).  Its two callers are the ``apply`` wrapper
    immediately below (every later assertion, from every screen that shows a
    balance) and :func:`app.services.account_service.create_account` (the
    origination).  The account factory used to construct the row itself, which
    made the origination the one assertion in the app written without the
    owner's write lock, without ruling R-EQ's did-this-change compare and
    without the shared log line; routing it here is what makes those rules
    properties of the TABLE rather than of whichever function did the INSERT.

    *The history is worth one sentence because it inverts twice.*  The split
    existed to be SHARED with ``routes/accounts/crud.update_account``; plan step
    X-f1e1 deleted that door (finding **N-195**) and left this function with a
    single caller and a callerless ``notes`` parameter (finding **N-198**).
    Ruling R-ES then deleted the ``notes`` COLUMN -- unread by anything in
    ``app/``, and a second definition of "the opening" beside the positional one
    :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.cash_anchor_facts` already sets -- and gave
    the function its second caller back on better ground: not two SURFACES
    sharing a definition, but two EVENTS sharing a write door.

    **It decides whether there is anything to append, and that decision is
    ruling R-EQ.**  Under the owner's write lock its transaction holds from its
    start (plan step ``balance:X-bn``), it reads which assertion governs the
    submitted day, and appends only when the submission differs
    from it.  Three properties are load-bearing and each is here rather than in
    a caller:

    * **The lock precedes the read.**  A compare-then-append is a
      read-modify-write, so an unserialised one lets two concurrent submissions
      each read the pre-state and both append.  *Since plan step
      ``balance:X-bn`` (ruling **R-CC115**) the lock is taken where the
      transaction begins, before ANY read, for both callers, and this function
      takes none; the rest of this bullet is the history of the acquisition it
      deleted.*  **Since ruling R-CC85 it is
      the cash door's only acquisition above that read**: the door
      (:func:`apply_anchor_true_up`) took its own a few statements earlier
      (ruling **R-CC79**) to guard a read of the latest assertion that this
      function now makes and hands back, so the door no longer takes it.  The
      lock is transaction-scoped, so it still covers the door's after-read,
      which precedes the commit that releases it.  It is NOT a
      guarantee that the advisory lock is the transaction's FIRST lock:
      ``lock_user_writes`` executes a statement and therefore AUTOFLUSHES, so
      a caller holding a dirty ORM row emits that ``UPDATE`` -- and takes its
      row lock -- before this line.  That ordering is the CALLER's to keep (finding **N-193**), and
      it is why ``routes/accounts/crud.update_account`` still takes the same
      re-entrant lock at its own top even though plan step X-f1e stopped it
      reaching this function at all.
    * **The governing assertion is asked for, never re-derived, and asked
      ONCE when once answers it** (ruling **R-CC85**).  The first read is
      :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.governing_anchor`, the account's latest
      assertion, which the cash door also reports.  Only when that record is
      dated AFTER the submitted day is
      :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.governing_anchor_on` asked for the day's
      own.  Both are ONE query, ``cash_ledger._facts._governing_row`` --
      one ordering, ``(observed_on, created_at, id)`` DESC, matching the walk's
      replay -- and differ only in its horizon.  A local ``MAX``/``first()``
      here would be a second statement of that rule, which is the defect class
      this module's own history is made of.  The read that is skipped is
      PROVED redundant, from that query's filter and ordering alone:

      ``_governing_row`` returns the first row, in one TOTAL order (``id`` is
      unique, so no two rows tie), of one set S -- the account's
      owner-declared assertions -- and for a day D the first row of S_D, the
      members of S with ``observed_on <= D``.  Let L be the first row of S.
      If ``L.observed_on <= D``, L is a member of S_D; S_D is a subset of S,
      so no member of S_D precedes L; so L is the first row of S_D, and the
      second read would return L.  If S is empty, S_D is empty too and both
      reads return ``None``.  Only when ``L.observed_on > D`` is L outside
      S_D, and then the day's record is a different row, read for itself.  The
      proof needs nothing of the order but that both reads share it, and
      nothing of the horizon but that it is membership by ``observed_on <=
      D``.  Both would run under the owner's lock, which the one writer of an
      owner-declared assertion (this function, ruling R-ES) takes, and before
      this assertion is staged, so they would see one S.  Reads per call: ONE
      when the day is on or after the latest assertion's (a save for today, an
      origination), TWO for a back-dated day.
    * **The comparison is against the row governing the SUBMITTED DAY, not the
      account's latest row.**  Two things follow, and both were measured.  The
      deleted unique index asked "does an identical row exist anywhere", so
      re-asserting a balance that had since been superseded was refused and
      reported as saved.  But comparing against the LATEST row instead has the
      mirror-image fault: a submission for an EARLIER day can never equal it, so
      a double-click on a back-dated correction appends every time -- reproduced
      on the loan door by two independent reviews of this step.  A submission
      for day D can only change what is true at or after D, so D is the horizon.
      **Plan step X-f1c4c is what made that reachable here**, by giving the cash
      door the date field the loan door has carried since Commit 16; the rule was
      installed one leaf earlier, deliberately, so a user-typed day never met the
      content-keyed index it replaced.

    **The day arrives ALREADY BOUNDED, and it is a TYPE that says so** (ruling
    **R-ER** for the rule, plan step X-f1e2 for the type).
    :func:`resolve_observation_day` supplies the default and enforces both
    bounds, so the same two rules govern the origination assertion
    ``account_service.create_account`` writes and every later one written here.
    This function took a raw ``date | None`` and re-resolved it, which read as a
    writer declining to trust its caller and was really the clock being read
    twice: the floor is time-dependent, so a midnight roll -- or a schedule
    rebuild committing -- between a caller's resolve and this one refuses the day
    the caller just produced.  Both doors resolve exactly once now, each BEFORE
    the lock, because a refused submission must not take the owner's write lock
    and the resolver takes none of its own (one aggregate SELECT over pay
    periods).

    **What it stages shrank twice, and both shrinks are the same ruling
    applied one table apart.**  It used to re-point ``current_anchor_period_id``
    and write ``current_anchor_balance`` before appending the row; ruling R-EH
    deleted those columns as a denormalized copy of the row itself.  It used to
    file the row against a pay period; ruling R-EO deleted THAT, because a
    balance assertion is a fact about a bank and a schedule operation must not
    be able to destroy it.  What is left is the assertion: an account, a
    balance, and the day it was true.

    The amortizing-kind gate (:class:`AmortizingAccountAnchorError`) lives on
    :func:`apply_anchor_true_up`, deliberately NOT here.  It was placed there so
    the second door -- which refused the kind at its own route validator -- was
    not gated twice; plan step X-f1e deleted that door and its duplicate gate,
    so the rule is now stated exactly once, on the only public entry point that
    asserts a cash balance.

    Args:
        account: An attached :class:`Account` row.  Caller owns the
            ownership check.
        new_balance: The validated :class:`Decimal` balance being asserted.
        observed_on: The :class:`ObservationDay` the balance is asserted TRUE
            for (ruling **R-DH**).  Only :func:`resolve_observation_day` mints
            one, so an unbounded day cannot reach this line.

    Returns:
        An :class:`AnchorStageReport`.  Its ``staged`` is ``True`` when an
        assertion was appended to the session and ``False`` when the submission
        matched the governing assertion and nothing was staged; the caller
        decides what that means for ITS transaction
        (:func:`apply_anchor_true_up` rolls back and reports ``UNCHANGED``, the
        account factory raises).  Its ``latest`` is the account's latest
        assertion as read before this assertion was staged, which the cash door
        reports as what governed today (ruling R-CC85).

    **It raises NOTHING, and saying so is a correction.**  It documented a
    ``RuntimeError`` "when the account carries no assertion at all, from
    ``cash_ledger.resolve_anchor``" -- but it does not call ``resolve_anchor``.
    It calls :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.governing_anchor` and, for a
    back-dated day, :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.governing_anchor_on`, and
    each returns ``None`` on an account with no history precisely because that
    is an honest answer to a WRITER where it is a broken invariant to a
    reader.  The claim
    was true of an earlier draft and load-bearing in the wrong direction: an
    account with no assertions is exactly the state
    ``account_service.create_account`` is in when it calls here.  The
    ``ValidationError`` the day bounds raise now belongs to each door's own
    :func:`resolve_observation_day` call, above this function.

    Stages the assertion via :func:`stage_anchor_true_up`, re-bases the
    account's posted anchor corrections, and commits.  Returns an
    :class:`AnchorTrueUpReport` the caller translates into its rendered
    response.

    **It reports the assertion that governs today on both sides of the write,
    and reads both under the owner's lock** (ruling **R-CC79**, developer
    2026-09-23).  It reported only the outcome until then, so the route read
    the governing assertion before calling -- outside the lock -- and again
    after, which let two tabs saving at once show the wrong acknowledgement:
    the "before" figure it compared against could be one a concurrent save had
    already replaced.  **The before is the stager's read** (ruling **R-CC85**):
    :func:`stage_anchor_true_up` takes the lock, reads the latest assertion
    once for its own compare and hands it back, so this door reads nothing
    before the write.  The after-read precedes the commit that releases the
    lock.  Reads of the governing assertion per call: TWO for a save dated on
    or after the latest assertion's day, as a save for today always is (the
    stager's latest, which is then also the record governing the submitted
    day, and the after); THREE for one dated before that day (the stager
    reads the submitted day's record too).  An ``UNCHANGED`` submission wrote
    nothing, so its after IS its before and is not read at all.

    **The C-17 optimistic lock left this path at plan step X-f1c3c** (ruling
    R-EN), and the reason is that the path stopped writing the row the lock
    guarded.  ``version_id`` increments when the ORM UPDATEs ``accounts`` and
    on nothing else; once ruling R-EH deleted the anchor cache columns a
    true-up only INSERTs a history row, so ``StaleDataError`` became
    structurally unreachable here.  **Measured** against the dev database and
    rolled back: adding an ``AccountAnchorHistory`` row and flushing leaves
    ``version_id`` at 33, and the very next line writing
    ``current_anchor_balance`` takes it to 34.

    The step accepted what that means rather than working around it.  **An
    assertion history is append-only, so a second tab overwrites no
    ASSERTION**: two assertions of different balances are two facts, the
    later-observed one is current, and neither is lost -- verbatim the contract
    :func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service.apply_loan_anchor_true_up` has
    documented since Commit 16.  This makes the cash half the same shape rather
    than the exception.  Bumping
    ``version_id`` deliberately to keep the lock alive was rejected: a write to
    ``accounts`` whose only purpose is to keep a lock alive is a mechanism with
    no fact under it.

    **That is a property of ONE table in a transaction that mutates three, and
    a first version of this paragraph stated it as though it covered the whole
    call.**  The ``sync_account_anchor_postings_all_scenarios`` below is a
    RECONCILE-TO-TARGET: it reads what is posted, subtracts that from what the
    assertions say, and INSERTs the difference into ``budget.journal_entries``
    / ``budget.account_postings``.  Nothing about append-only makes a
    read-modify-write safe, and the deleted ``version_id`` UPDATE had been
    serialising it by accident -- it autoflushed and took a row lock before the
    walk.  Measured with the interleave forced at the reconcile's read: two
    concurrent true-ups on an account reconciled at ``$4,000.00`` both answer
    200, both assertions survive, the resolver returns one of them -- and the
    linked ledger settles at ``$1,000.00`` against a resolved ``$2,000.00``,
    with the trial balance still ``$0.00`` because the anchor-equity leg
    mirrors the error.  The serialisation was made EXPLICIT at plan step
    X-f1c3c, a per-owner advisory lock taken inside the sync; **since plan step
    ``balance:X-bn`` it is held from the start of every writing transaction**
    (:mod:`app.db_transaction`), so every door into that same window (the
    settle self-heal, the direct anchor edit, the pay-period resync) is covered
    before its first read and the sync takes none of its own.
    The waiting transaction re-reads under READ COMMITTED, which ruling `balance:R-GU`
    guarantees for a WRITER (its override is also ``READ ONLY``), so it sees
    the winner's postings and reconciles to the true merged target.
    *History until plan step ``balance:X-bn``, which deleted every acquisition
    this paragraph names:* **since plan step X-f1c4b the SAME lock was taken
    one layer up**, in :func:`stage_anchor_true_up`, because ruling R-EQ's
    compare-then-append is itself a read-modify-write.  Ruling R-CC79 took it
    once more, HERE, above a read of what governs today that this door then
    made; ruling R-CC85 moved that read into the stager, below the stager's own
    acquisition, and this door's acquisition went with it.  It is re-entrant and
    transaction-scoped, so the reconcile's repeat costs nothing and the
    after-read below still holds it.  On THIS path it is also the transaction's
    first lock -- the route does only reads before calling (measured, statement
    by statement, by a neutral concurrency review) -- but that is a property of
    the route, not of the lock, and finding **N-193** stays open for the settle
    paths regardless.

    **It touches no entry, and that is ruling R-DH (d).**  It used to bulk-flip
    ``is_cleared`` on every entry dated on or before the server's today, which
    made "is this purchase already inside the balance the user just typed"
    an answer decided by the order two buttons were pressed.  The flag is
    gone; reconciliation is derived from each purchase's own recorded posting
    day.  Which outstanding purchases the statement actually showed is a
    separate step the route offers AFTER this commit succeeds
    (``reconcile_service.record_settled_days``) -- and it is deliberately not
    folded in here, because an UNCHANGED submission rolls this transaction
    back, so a reconciliation riding in it would be silently discarded while
    the UI reported a save.

    **The ``try`` / ``except IntegrityError`` around the re-sync left with the
    index** (ruling R-EQ, plan step X-f1c4b).  It existed to catch the F-103
    unique violation that the re-sync's autoflush surfaced and translate it into
    an outcome; with the decision made BEFORE anything is staged, an
    ``IntegrityError`` here is an unexpected constraint failure and its correct
    disposition is the 500 it now gets.

            :func:`resolve_observation_day` -- this function adds no rule of its
            own about the day and must not, or the two write doors would answer
            a back-dated submission differently.  It bounded it inside
            :func:`stage_anchor_true_up` until plan step X-f1e2; the resolve
            moved out to the doors so the account factory, which must refuse
            before it creates a row, does not make it the second application of
            a clock-dependent rule.

    Returns:
        The :class:`AnchorTrueUpReport`: the outcome -- ``UNCHANGED`` when the
        submission matched the governing assertion, in which case this
        function has rolled the session back and written nothing -- and the

"""Shekel Budget App -- the pay stub ENTRY door's service (plan step salary:S11-b).

A real pay stub is TRANSCRIBED line by line into the four tables of
:mod:`app.models.pay_stub` (``S11-a``) through this service and nothing else.
It moves ``$0.00``: no paycheck prices from a stub until the engine's
calibrated path (``S11-c``); the old calibration keeps pricing until then.

**What the door refuses, and whose rule each refusal is:**

* a date that is not a payday the app holds or projects a paycheck for
  (ruling **R-SAL49**, "Record the payday first"), and a payday later than the
  owner's next one (**R-SAL48**, "Up to next payday") -- asked of a new stub
  and of an edit that CHANGES the date, never of an edit that keeps it
  (**R-SAL53**, "Keep its date, allow edits": a stub whose payday later left
  the pay record stays correctable in place).  One test answers both
  "is it a payday" and "what does the app price that day": the calendar's own
  span, :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.span_containing`.  A day
  below the record is refused as the record's (``your pay record starts
  ...``); once the pay calendar's "Add earlier paychecks" door exists
  (``pay_calendar:C18-b``, not yet built), an earlier stub gets in by
  recording its payday there first;
* a NEW stub on a payday that already holds one, and an edit that moves a
  stub onto such a payday (fork 4, "One per payday", as ruling **R-SAL52**,
  "Refuse, show the saved one", amends it: nothing is overwritten unseen --
  the entry flow opens a held payday's stub instead);
* a stub missing any of the four taxes (``$0.00`` is a figure, a blank is
  not: decomposition item 2, "the four taxes required");
* a printed net the lines do not add up to, to the cent (ruling **R-SAL42**,
  decomposition item 2: typed once as a check, never stored);
* a one-off named like one of the profile's paycheck lines or a tax, or like
  another one-off on the same stub (ruling **R-SAL45**, compared ignoring
  capitals and extra spaces, **R-SAL51** (b)) -- the line and tax clash asked
  only of a one-off the save ADDS or RENAMES (**R-SAL57**, "Check only what a
  save adds"), so a one-off the door saved never blocks its own stub and a
  paycheck line stays free to take a name a saved one-off already has.

The payday's calendar range, the base pay and the amount bounds are the entry
schema's; a line or kind id the owner does not hold is not a refusal but a
NOT-FOUND (the 404 rule).

**A stub line records its own kind** (ruling **R-SAL58**, "Stub records its
kind", which retired **R-SAL56**'s refusal): the kind the stub prints each
line under, entered beside its amount, pre-set to the app's.  Every total
reads the stub's own kinds, never the paycheck line's, so editing a line --
its kind included -- moves no saved stub (finding **SAL-567**); the report
lists a kind that differs from the app's the way it lists an amount.

**Every write keys on the owned profile and stub, never on input.**  A stub's
``salary_profile_id`` is the profile the route resolved; a child row's
``pay_stub_id`` is never read from input at all (review L5 of ``S11-a``): each
child is appended to, updated on or removed from its stub's own collection, so
the database's keys are the only thing that places it.

**An edit writes the stub ROW whenever it changes anything**, including a
child-only edit, because the row's ``version_id`` guards the stub as one act
only if the row is in the UPDATE (``PayStub``'s docstring: SQLAlchemy bumps it
for the row alone).  An edit that changes nothing writes nothing and bumps
nothing -- the status seam's rule -- so re-saving a form nobody changed is not
a conflict.  A DOUBLE submit whose first post changed the stub IS one: the
second carries the version the first consumed, and the route turns it away
as stale like every versioned form in the app.

Flask-free: takes plain values and ORM rows, returns plain values; every
function that prices takes the route's

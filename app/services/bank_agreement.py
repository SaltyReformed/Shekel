"""The app's books beside the BANK's own record, day by day.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6e-2``, ruling **R-GF**: the comparison is an
INSTRUMENT and never a gate.  A refusal here deadlocks -- the import is what
fixes a disagreement, and a first import has matched nothing -- so this module
reports and refuses nothing.

**Why it compares MOVEMENT and not only level.**  A balance difference alone
cannot see a defect the owner's own true-up has already absorbed, and that is
measured rather than argued: on the developer's Checking account, over the 145
days his statement and his records both cover, **35 days carry a real
disagreement between his rows and the bank's lines, and 11 of them read as
EXACT agreement in the balance difference** because a same-day balance
assertion cancels the error to the cent.  Among the eleven are the ``$943.41``
of card paybacks finding **N-337** names, ``$2,090.47`` on 2026-07-31, and both
``$0.05`` payroll residues finding **N-391** measures -- **N-239**'s until
plan step balance:X-aw split that row, the residue being a standing per-paycheck
disagreement between the app's figures and the employer's rather than the
horizon defect X-aw closed.  So each day carries
three facts side by side rather than one:

* what the BANK's lines moved that day -- an observation;
* what the app's OWN settled rows moved that day -- the app's claim;
* what a balance ASSERTION moved that day -- the owner correcting the app.

The first two differ by the RESIDUE, which is the whole instrument: money one
side records and the other does not.  The third is why the running balances can
agree while the residue does not, and naming it is what stops the report
calling a true-up an agreement.

**And the level is still reported**, because the residue cannot say how far
apart the two records are TODAY and cannot say which side rests on an
assumption.  A first import seats its anchor by ``assumed_last_day`` (finding
**N-342**), and the signature of a wrong one is a CONSTANT offset across the
whole span rather than a difference that varies by day -- so the summary says
whether the offset is constant, which is the one shape that convicts the
anchor instead of the books.

**Days before the app's records begin are LABELLED, not counted.**  The
developer's statement starts 2026-01-02 and his records start 2026-03-26, so
83 days show real bank movement against an app that holds nothing -- which is
finding **N-314**, owned by ``balance:X-f3c``, and not a disagreement this
report can act on.  They are shown, because hiding a day the bank describes
would be the report deciding what the owner may see, and excluded from every
total and count, because a figure this arc cannot act on must not be added to
one it can.

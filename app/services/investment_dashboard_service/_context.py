    ``inputs.annual_contribution_limit``, copied in

    **The owner's period SET is deliberately NOT a field** (plan step C2-f2c).
    It is :meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.reported_periods` off
    :attr:`balance_ctx`, which is memoized on the calendar
    (:meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.saved`), so a field here
    would be a memo of a memo -- the shape an adversarial review of plan step
    C2-c already refused one tier down.  ``current_period`` IS a field because
    nothing memoizes it: it is a bisect over that window at
    ``balance_ctx.as_of``, and holding one answer for the render is what stops
    two of this package's readers pairing one clock with another's calendar.

    Attributes:
        params: The account's :class:`InvestmentParams` row, or ``None``
            when the user has not configured the account.  ``None`` is a
            valid dashboard state (the projection and chart degrade to
            empty containers); the growth-chart fragment guards it out
            earlier and never reaches a context with ``params is None``.
        current_balance: The model-from-anchor END-of-current-period
            balance from the :mod:`app.services.balance_at` seam -- the
            displayed "current balance" tile, which agrees to the cent with
            the /savings net-worth tile, the year-end asset aggregate, and
            the net-worth trend (an anchor-in-past investment shows its
            modeled market value, not the flat cash-basis contribution
            total).  It is read at the CURRENT PERIOD's end, which is the
            convention every net-worth surface uses; the projection seeds from
            the same curve one day before its own window opens (see
            ``projection_start`` / ``projection_seed``).
        projection_start: The day the projection's window OPENS -- the day
            after the history line's last valued point
            (:func:`_projection_start`, ruling R-AF).
        projection_ytd: The year-to-date employee contribution the growth
            engine's annual-limit accounting must START from
            (:func:`_projection_ytd`).  It is the THROUGH-current total on this
            surface, because :attr:`projection_start` puts the current pay
            period outside the projection window.
        projection_seed: The account's MODELLED balance on the day before
            :attr:`projection_start`, so it IS the history line's last point and
            the two lines meet (:func:`_resolve_seed_balance`).  Nothing is
            filtered out of it and nothing is subtracted from it: the window
            opens strictly after its date, so the growth engine can neither
            re-grow a day it already grew nor re-apply a contribution it already
            holds (findings N-80 / N-84).  It is also the base of the chart's
            cumulative-contribution series.
        inputs: The :class:`InvestmentInputs` the growth engine needs
            (periodic contribution, employer params, annual contribution
            limit, YTD contributions).
        contributions: The per-period contribution timeline (deductions
            plus transfer receipts) fed to ``project_balance``.
        deductions: The raw :class:`PaycheckDeduction` rows targeting
            this account; drives the contribution-prompt decision.
        active_profile: The user's active :class:`SalaryProfile`, or
            ``None``; drives the deduction-path salary-profile link.
        balance_ctx: The read pass's ``BalanceContext``; the history chart and
            anchor caption read it so both agree with the headline balance, and
            its :meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.reported_periods`
            is this package's whole period domain.
        anchor_as_of: Display-tz date of the account's latest anchor event
            (C1 hero caption), or ``None`` when no baseline scenario exists.
        planned_retirement_date: The owner's planned retirement date, or
            ``None`` when unset.  Resolved ONCE here because two consumers read
            it -- the horizon slider's default (:func:`._cards
            ._compute_default_horizon`) and the chart's retirement marker
            (:func:`._chart._build_chart_markers`) -- and each loading it
            privately meant two ``user_settings`` queries per dashboard render
            for one value.
        current_period: The SAVED pay period covering ``balance_ctx.as_of``, or
            ``None`` when the pass's clock falls outside the owner's schedule
            -- before their first payday or past their horizon.  ``None`` is a
            real answer FOUR readers here branch on, so it is preserved rather
            than clamped: the headline falls back to a date-precise seam read,
            the history series is empty, the growth chip is hidden, and the
            suggested contribution spreads from the pass's clock instead.  The
            fourth is the one that matters most for this attribute: unlike the
            other three it changes a DOLLAR figure -- the amount the
            contribution-transfer form arrives pre-filled with.

    It used to be ``date.today()``, 10-13 days short of the history line's last

    total leaves the annual limit one period's contribution too roomy: on a
    $23,500 limit with $1,000 a period and today in the year's 15th period, the

"""Investment dashboard -- the growth CHART.

Everything ``investment/_growth_chart.html`` draws: the forward projection over
the owner's own paychecks to the horizon, the modeled-history series behind
it, the Today and
retirement markers between them, and the optional what-if overlay.  Split from
the cards at this package's module-size ceiling on plan step D1c's cohesion
line -- that half answers "what does this account look like right now", this one
answers "what does it look like from here on".

The initial dashboard chart and the HTMX fragment share ONE pay-period basis
at the slider default horizon, so they cannot disagree.  **That basis stopped
being SYNTHETIC at pay-calendar plan step C2-e**: it was a fabricated 14-day
axis whatever the owner's real cadence (ledger row P20), and it is now
:meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.projection_axis` over their own
paydays.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, all money is
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`; ``float`` appears only at the Chart.js
serialization boundary.

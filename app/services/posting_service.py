"""
Shekel Budget App -- Posting Service

The sole writer of the append-only double-entry posting ledger
(``budget.journal_entries`` + ``budget.account_postings``, Build-Order
Step 2; see :mod:`app.models.journal_entry`).  Step 2 piloted the mechanism
on settled transfers; later Build-Order steps added cash, loan, and paycheck
sources by calling the same private balanced-write path
(:func:`_emit_balanced_entry`), so an unbalanced entry can never be written
from any source.

**Flask-isolated** (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture rule): this service takes
plain data / ORM objects, returns ORM objects or plain values, and never
imports ``request`` / ``session``.  It **flushes but never commits** -- the
caller (the transfer service in Commit 5, a test, or a future source
writer) owns the transaction boundary.

**Reconcile-to-target, not append-blindly.**  Every sync here makes the
ledger's NET posted effect for a source equal a single target, by emitting
one balanced delta entry PER (PAY PERIOD, ENTRY DATE) for the difference
between the target and what is already posted there.  That one design is
idempotent and covers every lifecycle path -- settle, revert, archive,
cancel, delete, restore -- through a single call:

* a repeat sync computes zero deltas and writes nothing (no double-post);
* a revert / delete reverses *exactly what was posted* (read back from the
  ledger), so an amount edited while Projected and re-settled posts the new
  amount and nothing stale survives.

**Corrections are attributed to what they correct** (the 2026-07-02
adversarial review's R2 rule): a reversal entry carries the PAY PERIOD of
the postings it reverses -- read back from the ledger per period, never the
source row's current period -- and inherits the latest ``entry_date`` it
reverses.  A revert-and-move PATCH therefore nets the ORIGINAL period to
zero instead of stamping the reversal into the new period, so a net-zero
pair never straddles periods (a later truncate of the new period cannot
strand half of it) and date-grouped reporting nets a reversal against the
entry it undoes.

**The signed amount is debit-positive and class-independent.**  The *from*
account's leg is ``-amount`` (a credit: money leaving) and the *to*
account's leg is ``+amount`` (a debit: money entering), so the entry sums to
zero whether a leg lands on an asset or a liability ledger account.  The
builder never branches on account class (see the
:mod:`app.models.journal_entry` module docstring).

**A transfer is TWO movements, each posted on its own bank day against the
owner's Transfers-in-transit account** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``,
rulings **R-BAL45** and **R-BAL101**).  Through that step the ledger booked
a settled transfer as ONE entry ``{from -figure, to +figure}`` off the income
shadow's record and settle day, which was sufficient only because the
transfer service mirrored one day onto both shadows (Transfer Invariant 3);
the ruled shape lets each side post when ITS bank shows it.  So a transfer's
legs are its shadows' covering movements, and they post through the same
movement writer every purchase and covering movement posts through
(:mod:`app.services._posting_purchases`, the counter leg dispatched by the
parent's shape) -- :func:`sync_transfer_postings` is the pair's door, not a
second writer.  The one-entry ``transfer`` source is LEGACY: the deploy's
first resync reverses whatever it posted, once, and every later sync leaves
it at zero (the shape ``balance:X-bi-4a`` gave the transaction source).  The
amount is still what the shadow RECORDED and never ``transfers.amount``: a
movement's figure is the record, and ``cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg`` is
the one producer of its signed cash.

    The PAIR's door (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``, rulings **R-BAL45** and
    **R-BAL101**): a settled transfer is two entries, one per side's covering
    movement on its own bank day, each against the owner's Transfers-in-transit

    from-side bank showed it and ``{to-side account +figure, transit -figure}``

    keyed by ``transaction_entry_id`` and dated by the movement's own

    purchase does; what this door adds is reaching both sides from the parent,
    reversing the LEGACY one-entry shape, and healing both endpoints' anchor
    corrections.

    **It takes no ``settled`` flag, and that is the point.**  Through
    ``X-bi-6-1b`` this was told whether to post or reverse, because the ONE
    entry it booked had no fact of its own to read.  A movement has: it posts
    iff it is dated under a contributing parent
    (:func:`~app.services._posting_purchases.purchase_posts`), a settle dates
    it and a revert UN-DATES it (ruling **R-BAL61**), a cancel or a soft delete

    resync after this step reverses every production legacy entry once (19
    transfers on the 2026-09-22 17:06 dump), and every later sync finds
    nothing to do.  The reversal and the two per-movement
    entries land on the same day for every one of them (measured on the
    2026-09-20 restore: every movement's day equals its old entry's), so each
    real account's net per day is unchanged and the loan checked-projection
    assert holds through the move.

    **It reads every shadow of the transfer, deleted or not**

    it still holds reverses -- which is what lets the loan lineage probe hand
    a soft-deleted payment here and get its cash reversed (the E1a review's
    H2 case), and what a pair soft-deleted and rebuilt needs: the dead pair's

    by ruling **R-FM**'s identity and, for a ``purchases``-basis envelope,
    the envelope's UN-DATED purchases on the close day.  Those are movements
    in flight now: they post when they are dated, on their own day, and the
    close books nothing.  So the TRANSACTION source's target is empty on

    reverse whatever that source posted before this step -- a legacy leg the

    (``cash_ledger.settled_cash_facts``: every dated movement, on the
    movement's own account, ruling **R-BAL75**), so the two cannot price
    one movement two ways.

    **A FAMILY since plan step X-f3b, and that is ruling R-FM** (finding
    **N-274**).  A purchase whose bank posting day the owner recorded is a cash
    movement of its own, on its own day, so this reconciles one entry per such
    movement (:func:`~app.services._posting_purchases.emit_purchase_deltas`)

    transaction (a settle, a revert, a re-category, an amount edit, a period
    move, a status change, a purchase recorded or re-dated) reconciles its
    movements too, with no second list of call sites to keep in step.  The
    per-purchase door this once had beside it (``sync_purchase_postings``)
    had zero callers since plan step X-au-c3 and is deleted (ledger row
    **BAL-507**).

    **Reconciles over the accounts, periods, AND entry dates the transaction
    has ALREADY posted to**, read from the ledger by ``transaction_id``
    (:func:`~app.services._posting_write.posted_by_period`), unioned with the
    target -- NOT a single fixed pair.  This is what makes a
    revert-and-recategorize correct (the reversal lands on the OLD category
    -- the one in the ledger -- not the new ``txn.category_id``; plan Section
    2.8 CRITICAL), and what makes a revert-and-MOVE correct (the reversal
    lands in the OLD period at the exact date of the postings it reverses --
    the 2026-07-02 adversarial review's R2 attribution rule, per-date since
    plan step E1a -- so the net-zero pair never straddles periods and a later
    period truncate cannot strand half of it).  Within each (period, date)
    key the non-zero deltas always sum to zero (a target sums to zero, and
    the posted side sums to zero because every prior entry balanced and lives
    in exactly one key), so each emitted entry is balanced and has >= 2 legs
    by construction -- :func:`_emit_balanced_entry` never sees a single leg.

    Every ordinary-transaction lifecycle action is one call to this function,
    and none of them says whether the row has settled: a movement posts iff
    it is dated under a contributing parent
    (:func:`~app.services._posting_purchases.purchase_posts`), whatever the
    parent's status, and a revert, a cancel or a delete reverses what the
    ledger holds for movements the act un-dated or the parent's exclusion
    made worthless.  The ``settled`` flag this took through ``X-bi-3e`` chose
    the row's OWN target, and a row has none.

    A transfer shadow (``transfer_id`` set) is a row like any other here since
    plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3`` (ruling **R-BAL101**): its own TRANSACTION
    source target is empty as every row's is, and its covering movement posts
    through the movement writer against the owner's transit account.  The
    guard that returned ``[]`` for a shadow (ruling **R-BAL45**'s interval)
    is gone with the interval, so a door that reaches a shadow's family
    reconciles it rather than skipping it; the pair's own door,
    :func:`sync_transfer_postings`, reaches both sides from the parent.
    Idempotency rests on the delta math plus the row's ``version_id``
    optimistic lock (a concurrent double mark-done collides on the version,
    surfacing as a 409).

    and the third of the three deploy-time reconciles that between them cover
    every journal entry the app writes.  It exists because those two do NOT
    reach an ordinary transaction or a NON-loan transfer: the loan package's
    staleness detector is scoped to one loan's linked ledger
    (``loan_posting_service._sync._resync_stale_transfers``) and the anchor
    backfill reconciles only the corrections, so a checking-to-savings transfer
    and every ordinary settled row were maintained per-mutation and by nothing
    else.

    **What it is FOR, and why it is a permanent hook rather than a one-off**
    (ruling R-DH (b), ``docs/audits/balance_architecture/archive/anchor_settle_partition.md``).
    ``journal_entries.entry_date`` is the movement's own ``settled_on`` for
    every movement-sourced entry (``_posting_purchases.emit_purchase_deltas``;
    a transfer's two since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``), a day that moved
    from the UTC civil day to the user's on 2026-07-31.  Every entry written before that
    carries the old day, so the STORED ledger and the two folds that now read
    the new one disagree for any settle recorded between midnight UTC and the
    user's midnight -- on production, one ``$1,910.95`` mortgage payment
    stamped 2026-07-02 00:38:53 UTC that belongs to the evening of 2026-07-01.
    This walks every source back through the SAME go-forward sync, so a
    re-dated entry is identical to a freshly posted one by construction; there
    is no second implementation of the rule and no SQL restatement of it,
    which is the property this whole arc exists to hold.  **Since plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-4a`` it is also what brings the TRANSACTION source to
    zero** (ruling **R-BAL80**): a plan row posts nothing of its own, so the
    legs that source wrote before this step -- an envelope's close booking
    its un-dated purchases on the close day -- are reversed on the first
    deploy of this tree and left at zero after, by the same reconcile.  **And
    since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3`` it is what RE-BOOKS every settled
    transfer into its ruled shape** (rulings **R-BAL45**, **R-BAL98**): the
    one-entry ``transfer`` source is reversed to zero and the two per-movement
    entries are posted against the owner's transit account, by
    :func:`sync_transfer_postings`' re-book half -- the code every settle runs,
    so the re-book is the go-forward posting by construction and no SQL
    restates it.  The first deploy of that tree logs every settled transfer
    as changed (19 on the 2026-09-22 17:06 production dump); every later one
    logs zero.

    **It re-books EVERY source first and re-checks the anchor corrections
    ONCE, after both arms** (ruling **R-BAL103**, developer 2026-09-22).  The
    per-source doors re-check at once, right for one settle and wrong for a
    batch: a transfer not yet reached still holds its legacy one-entry
    posting, which the account walk does not read (the ``transfer_id IS
    NULL`` exclusion ``X-bi-6-5`` deletes), so a walk inside the loop books a
    true-up for money only waiting its turn and that transfer's own re-check
    reverses it -- both permanent in an append-only ledger, 40 of the 97
    entries the first 6-3 deploy wrote on its rehearsal over the 2026-09-22
    production dump.  So both arms run the doors' re-book halves
    (:func:`_rebook_transaction_family`, :func:`_rebook_transfer_family`) and
    the one re-check per scenario (one owner; the self-heal locks the owner
    off the entries) reads the finished ledger.  The union's earliest day can
    only make the re-check run where one source alone would skip it.

    It stays wired on every deploy rather than being deleted after one run, for
    the same reason its two siblings are: reconcile-to-target makes it a no-op
    at target, so it costs one pass and converts any future drift -- a rule
    change, a hand-edited row, a half-applied migration -- into a self-heal
    instead of a silent divergence.

    Idempotent and self-healing.  A settled row already at target posts nothing;
    a row whose target DATE moved gets its old-date legs reversed and its new
    -date legs posted in one balanced pair by the re-book halves of
    :func:`sync_transaction_postings` / :func:`sync_transfer_postings`, which
    reconcile over the ``(period, entry_date)`` keys already in the ledger
    unioned with the target (plan step E1a's per-date attribution) -- so a
    moved date is an ordinary reconcile, not a special case this function has to
    know about.

    Loan payment transfers are re-synced here too and that is deliberate
    duplication of effort, not of RULE: the loan package would reach the same
    ones through its own detector, and both paths reach this module's
    :func:`_rebook_transfer_family`, so whichever runs first leaves the other at
    target.  **Its transfer half is total over the family the ledger holds
    for the same reason its transaction half is** (below): it walks every
    live transfer that is settled OR holds a dated covering movement on a
    live shadow, PLUS every transfer -- live or not -- the legacy one-entry
    source ever posted for, and hands each to the pair's door, which reads
    each movement's own state and brings the legacy source to zero.

    Flushes but does NOT commit -- the caller owns the transaction boundary
    (``scripts.init_database.resync_all_cash_postings_after_migration``, which
    initialises ``ref_cache`` first because the migration host does not).

    **The counts are sources CHANGED, not sources walked** (finding N-133 / F8).
    A hook that rewrites the whole production ledger on every deploy and reports
    the same number whether it moved every date or nothing at all tells the
    operator only that it ran.  Both sync functions return the journal entries
    they emitted -- empty when already at target -- so "changed" is observable
    without a second query, and a healthy deploy logs ``0, 0``.  The FIRST
    deploy after a dating rule moves is the one that logs a non-zero count, and
    that line is the only evidence the one-time re-date happened.

    **The re-date is ONE-WAY, and that is a stated risk rather than a
    discovered one.**  ``entrypoint.sh`` runs ``set -eEuo pipefail`` and calls
    ``scripts/init_database.py``, so a failure here aborts the container and the
    auto-rollback fires before anything commits.  But if the healthcheck fails
    AFTER this commits, the rolled-back image reads a display-dated ledger with
    the previous image's UTC rules, and only the entries whose two days differ
    are affected (on production at the cutover: one payment, one day).  Rolling
    back ACROSS a dating change therefore needs this hook re-run under the old
    image, not just a container swap.

    **It is the THIRD multi-owner transaction, and it takes every per-user
    write lock up front** (plan step X-f1c3c, finding N-193).  It iterates every
    owner's settled rows in ID order, and each one can reach the anchor
    self-heal and so ``lock_user_writes(owner)`` -- an unordered multi-key
    acquisition, which is exactly what two concurrent sweeps deadlock on.  A
    first version of the lock's docstring called the two backfill functions
    "the only multi-owner transactions" and missed this one, which is the FIRST
    of the three deploy hooks to run.

    **Its transaction half is no longer settled-only** (ruling **R-FM**, plan
    step X-f3b): it walks every non-transfer row that is settled OR carries a
    purchase with a recorded bank posting day, and passes each row its own
    settled truth.  That is what makes the hook total over the family the ledger
    now holds -- a purchase against a still-Projected envelope is real cash that
    left the bank -- and it is what moves the existing rows onto the new split
    without a backfill: the first deploy after migration ``b7c3d9e1f204``
    reverses the part of each envelope's cash leg its posted purchases now own
    and posts those purchases at their own days, in one balanced pass per row.

    Returns:
        ``(transactions_changed, transfers_changed)`` -- how many sources this
        pass actually re-posted, for the deploy log.

    # That refusal is right for a SINGLE write path, where a caller asking about
    # one transfer must not get a fabricated posting.  It is wrong for a batch
    # self-heal that walks every row in the database and runs at container start
    # (``scripts/init_database.py``): one repairable row would make the app
    # unbootable for every user, and the operator could not even reach the
    # screen that shows which row it was.  Skipping keeps the failure loud in
    # the log and bounded to the family that caused it.
    #
    # **Skipped WHOLE, under a SAVEPOINT** (the leaf-1 adversarial review of
    # plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``, finding 1).  The pair's door writes in
    # sequence -- the legacy reversal, then one side, then the other -- and a
    # refusal on the second side would otherwise leave the first side and the
    # reversal committed by this hook: the from-account debited into transit
    # with nothing arriving, a trial balance that still closes, and no reader
    # to trip.  The one-entry door resolved every input before its first
    # write, so its skip was clean by construction; a per-movement door has no
    # such moment, and the savepoint gives the batch the atomicity the door
    # cannot.

    stored annual salary: a second walk of the raises beside the engine's,
    agreeing because both called one function, and one the pay list's
    replacement rule (a recorded entry replaces the forecast raises due by
    its payday) could never have reached.  The raise set is the basis's own

    **It shares ONE TERMINATION RULE with the paychecks** (ruling
    **R-SAL11**): the end year is stored per raise and read by the one walk.

    **It evaluates each YEAR at December 1**, so every raise effective during
    that year -- recurring or one-time -- is applied, where the engine prices
    each payday at its own date.  A payday in a year whose raise lands after
    January is priced here from that year's post-raise pay; unifying that is
    plan step **salary:S3**'s, which makes the engine price the whole
    projected horizon.

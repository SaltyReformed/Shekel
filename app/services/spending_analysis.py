"""
Shekel Budget App -- Shared Spending-Analysis Primitives

The settled-expense primitives shared by every retrospective spending
surface: the Year-End spending section (:mod:`year_end_summary_service`)
and the unified Spending report (:mod:`spending_report_service`, whose
``_build_surprises`` is the settled-surprises kernel the retired Variance
tab once owned; the retired per-period Trends engine read spending through
here too until the D7 rebuild removed its last consumer).

Extracting them here means the "what counts as measured spending" rule is
defined once rather than re-implemented per surface (coding-standards rule
13; the T-P3 ``projection_inputs`` precedent, which closed a cross-file
``duplicate-code`` finding the same way):

* :func:`query_settled_expenses` -- the settled-expense load selected by
  a PERIOD SET (settled status, expense type, not deleted, scoped to the
  owner's cash-flow set / scenario / period set).  Its one caller is the Spending report's
  pay-period arm, which no route reaches today; the sibling below is what a
  live render runs.  The two share their filters, so a change to what
  "settled spending" selects is still a single edit.  **Each answers the
  set's OWN rows beside the EXPENSE LEG of every settled transfer the set
  touches, read off the parent in ``budget.transfers``** (leaf
  ``balance:X-bi-6-1b``, ruling **R-BAL86**): a
  :class:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.PlanItems`, where it was the rows
  with the settled transfer-out shadow among them.
* :func:`query_settled_expenses_in_span` -- the same filters selected
  by the attribution rule instead of a period set: COALESCE(due_date,
  owning period start) inside a calendar span, across ALL the user's pay
  periods, over both tables.  The Spending report's calendar windows read
  through it so a bill due in month M is attributed to M even when its
  funding period does not overlap M.
* :func:`recorded_spend`, :func:`planned_spend` and
  :func:`resolved_actual_amount` -- the per-item kernels, and since leaf
  ``balance:X-bi-6-1b`` **the ONE place this package tells a row and a leg
  apart for a FIGURE**: each routes to the producer of its shape
  (``row_valuation`` / ``cash_ledger`` for a row, their leg twins for a leg)
  and derives nothing itself, so the consumers that reduce a window's
  items ask one question each.  ``resolved_actual_amount`` is the
  settled-surprises kernel's plan-at-entry vs recorded-at-settle rule (a
  settled item is worth what it RECORDED as having moved; an unsettled one
  has recorded nothing, so it asks the amount model for its plan and shows
  zero variance BY CONSTRUCTION).
* :func:`signed_pct` -- the guarded "signed value as a percentage of a
  base" helper (``None`` when the base is zero), shared by the surprises
  figures and the Spending hero's vs-prior / vs-average chips.
* :func:`payment_timeliness_from_txns` -- the on-time / late / average
  days-before-due rule, given the already window-attributed settled
  expenses.

Pure-function module -- no Flask imports; the only side effects are the two
read queries, :func:`query_settled_expenses` and
:func:`query_settled_expenses_in_span`.

    in *period_ids* -- over the rows, and over the parents of the legs.

    **The items are the PAYCHECK's across the set -- checking and its cards
    -- not one account's** (developer ruling ``credit_card:R-CC16``, plan
    step CC-4-3), and since leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-1b`` (ruling **R-BAL86**)
    they are the set's OWN rows plus one LEG per settled transfer, read off

    .set_transfer_legs_in_periods` draws each transfer the set touches from
    the side :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.leg_accounts_shown` names
    (ruling ``R-CC23``: once, from the balance line's side, when both
    endpoints are members), kept where it is the EXPENSE leg -- money that
    left, which is what spending is; the income leg on the far endpoint is
    not spend, as the income shadow's type never was.  A card payment is
    therefore one settled leg, on the balance account's side.  It was
    ``Transaction.account_id == account_id``, then the paycheck-rows clause
    that carried the settled transfer-out shadow in as a row.

    **It eager-loads ``category`` and NOT ``pay_period``**, and the second half
    of that changed at pay-calendar plan step **C2-f3d** -- in BOTH queries,
    for one reason: an AST and grep census over everything reachable from
    ``compute_spending_report`` found no read of ``txn.pay_period`` anywhere.
    The period IS the window on this path, so its identity is already resolved
    (:func:`._window._resolve_window`), and neither the breakdown, the hero nor
    ``settled_contribution`` asks a row which paycheck it sits in.  The load's
    stated reason was that a caller "attributes by period", which no caller
    does.

    **THAT CENSUS IS NO LONGER TOTAL, and it is recorded here rather than
    re-run because what changed is reachability, not this query.**  The
    surprises list prices a row through
    ``cash_ledger.resolve_transaction_amount`` as of 2026-09-05 (the
    ``/analytics/spending`` fix), and rule 4's arm --
    ``LoanPricing.derive_cash`` -> ``loan_loaders.installment_for`` -- reads a
    ``pay_period`` on every call, because that producer takes the period start
    eagerly.  **Since plan step balance:X-au-f-2 it is the PARENT TRANSFER's
    period rather than the shadow's** (ruling R-BAL10 moved the answer to the
    parent), so the chain this query would have to load is
    ``Transaction.transfer -> pay_period``; the count is unchanged and the
    relationship is not.  It is unreachable on production today, where
    ``budget.loan_payment_settings`` is empty, and reachable in seeded data the
    moment a payment is tracked in derive mode.  So the sentence above is true
    of every arm but that one; the removal is not re-litigated here, and
    whether this query should adopt
    ``amount_relationships.pricing_load_options`` -- which would re-add the
    ``pay_period`` load C2-f3d removed -- is finding **N-296**'s, whose census
    of unguarded batch pricing callers this reader now joins.

    **What the removal actually costs, said conditionally because the two
    queries differ in whether they run.**  This one is reached only from the
    pay-period arm, which no route builds (see :func:`._window._series_windows`),
    so its ``joinedload`` executed on zero live renders; what it did there was
    hydrate a ``PayPeriod`` per window into the identity map, which is what hid
    the ``db.session.get`` the retired ordinal walk beside it ran.  The sibling
    is the one every ``/analytics/spending`` render runs twelve times, and its
    ``contains_eager`` went too -- **its JOIN is load-bearing and its
    hydration was not**, which an earlier draft of this paragraph conflated:
    the COALESCE attribution filter runs on the join, so the join stays and
    only the ``PayPeriod`` columns leave the SELECT.  Measured on a clone of
    production: the same 29 rows with the same ids, six fewer columns each.

    Args:
        scenario_id: The budget scenario to scope to (the caller's
            baseline).
        period_ids: The pay-period ids to include.  An empty list yields

    for a transfer leg since leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-1b``), and an unsettled
    one has recorded nothing, so it reads back its own PLAN
    (:func:`planned_spend`) and its individual variance is exactly zero.  A
    "surprise" is an item whose recorded figure differs from its plan.

    **Which rows can produce one changed at plan step X-au-c3, and it is a
    widening the surprises list wanted.**  The old rule read
    ``actual_amount``, which was populated only when a HUMAN had typed a
    correction -- so a settled row was a surprise only if somebody had retyped
    its figure, and a row whose settle booked something other than its estimate
    for any other reason (a salary row's live recompute, a loan payment's
    payment-date escrow) recorded nothing and reported a variance of zero.  A
    settled row now always records what moved, so the comparison finally answers
    the question the list is named for.  Whether the figure came from a human is
    a separate fact with its own home: the covering movement's
    ``figure_source_id`` (the row's ``settled_basis_id`` through ``X-bi-4a``).

    **THE FALL-THROUGH ASKS THE AMOUNT MODEL since plan step X-bu, and that is
    what makes the zero variance STRUCTURAL rather than an agreement between two
    producers.**  It read the row's own ``estimated_amount`` column -- through
    an ``owned_amount`` accessor from plan step X-au-c2b, and directly before
    that -- so an unsettled row whose plan a cutover had declared DERIVED
    carries no figure and this REFUSED, while the estimate half beside it in
    ``_build_surprises`` resolved. That is finding **BAL-462**'s failure mode
    exactly, on the unsettled population instead of the settled one: same
    exception, same page, same class of row. It was unreachable only because
    this kernel's one caller filters to settled rows in SQL -- a caller
    convention, which is what BAL-462 already paid for trusting.

    Both halves are now the SAME CALL on the same row and the same basis, so an
    unsettled row's delta is zero because there is nothing for it to be
    different from. **BAL-462's remedy said this reader "is correct and
    stays"**; two neutral adversarial reviews of X-bu measured the surviving
    refusal, and the developer superseded that clause on 2026-09-05 rather than
    close the finding with the obligation recorded in prose -- which is the very
    thing BAL-462 exists to name.

    **It takes the BASIS rather than building one**, the pattern every reader of
    a possibly-derived row follows: the plan may be a live derivation, so a
    basis is REQUIRED and not optional, and its one caller already holds the one
    it built for the estimate half. Passing a second basis would resolve the
    same row against a different pass.

    Args:
        txn: The row or transfer leg to resolve.  Its settlement record is
            read, and ``status`` is declared ``lazy="joined"`` on both models
            so nothing here needs an explicit load.
        basis: The read pass's
            :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis`, built once by the
            caller.  REQUIRED rather than optional for the same reason
            ``_build_surprises`` states it: a row whose plan is derived cannot
            be priced without one, and an optional basis would put the refusal
            back one branch later.

        The comparison actual as a ``Decimal``.

    The THIRD shared window rule, beside :func:`validate_window` and
    :func:`calendar_window_bounds`, and it is here for their reason: the
    Spending report and the confirmed-ledger Income Statement each render a
    window heading, and a rule defined per surface is a rule two surfaces can
    come to disagree about.

    **It was written TWICE, and finding that was pylint's** (plan step
    C2-f3a).  Ledger row **P47** recorded three copies of the pay-period
    REGISTER; collapsing those onto
    :func:`~app.utils.dates.pay_period_range_label` left the two enclosing
    ``_window_label`` functions structurally identical, and ``duplicate-code``
    said so.  They were the same three-arm dispatch over two window dataclasses
    that carry the same four fields -- ``StatementWindow`` and
    ``SpendingWindow`` -- and their month arms produced one string from two
    spellings (``date(...).strftime("%B")`` against an f-string format spec).
    So the register was the visible half of a whole duplicated function.

    **It takes the SCALARS rather than a window**, exactly as
    :func:`validate_window` does at the same two call sites, because the two
    dataclasses are per-surface types this module may not choose between --
    and in :func:`validate_window`'s ORDER, ``month`` before ``year``, so two
    functions called side by side at both sites cannot be read as taking their
    arguments in different orders.

    Args:
        window_type: ``"pay_period"``, ``"month"`` or ``"year"``.
        month: The calendar month 1-12, for a ``"month"`` window.
        year: The calendar year, for a ``"month"`` or ``"year"`` window.
        period: The resolved
            :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` for a
            ``"pay_period"`` window.  ``None`` for the calendar windows, and
            also when a pay-period window's id names none of the owner's
            periods -- which is what makes the empty string below a real
            answer rather than a fallback.

    Returns:
        ``"Feb 21 - Mar 06, 2026"`` (pay period), ``"January 2026"`` (month),

"""
Shekel Budget App -- The Rows a Definition's Unarchive Brings Back

ONE statement of which rows unarchiving a recurring definition restores (plan
step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, rulings **R-PC93** and **R-PC95**, developer
2026-09-23), read by the two doors that restore them --
``routes/templates/crud.unarchive_template`` and
``routes/transfers/lifecycle.unarchive_transfer_template`` -- and by the
doors that refuse to strand a planned row below an account's books
(``app.services.planned_rows_books``).

**Why the refusal reads it.**  Archiving a definition hides its still-Projected
rows, and unarchiving brings them back.  A books move made while the
definition was archived saw no live row to strand, so it went through; the
unarchive then restored rows inside the opening balance, and a recurring
transfer's unarchive -- whose maintain pass retires a row the rule no longer
names -- deleted the current paycheck's row without a word, measured by the
C18-a round-2 review.  R-PC93 treats the rows an unarchive would bring back as
planned rows at every door that moves a definition's books.  That holds only
while the refusal counts EXACTLY the rows the unarchive restores, which is why
both read :class:`UnarchiveScope`: two spellings of one scope are two homes
that have to agree (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).

**A row its definition's books already drop STAYS DELETED** (ruling
**R-PC95**, the C18-a round-3 review's H-C).  The archive's hide and the
owner's own delete of one occurrence write the same flag -- a hand delete of
a recurring row is a SOFT delete, whose tombstone keeps the maintain pass from
re-creating the occurrence -- and nothing on the row tells the two apart.  So
an unarchive that restored every soft-deleted row also restored one its owner
deleted while the definition was active, below the books when those had
since moved past it (allowed: a deleted row is not planned), inside the
opening balance: measured through the real routes, on dev and on this step
alike, the row's $10.00 counted a second time.  Now the rows answering an
occurrence the books drop, as they stand when the definition is unarchived,
are left deleted, and the unarchive says so (:func:`stays_deleted_notice`),
naming every one.  **The scope judges each hidden row as it stands and never
asks how the row got there.**  A hand delete made before a books move is one
way; the C18-a round-4 review measured another -- an unpaid copy revived by a
status revert (refused since ruling **R-PC97**) and then hidden by the
archive -- and it refuted the sentence this paragraph used to end on, that
such a row "can only be one its owner deleted by hand".  So no argument about
which writers can leave one is made here.

**A row a walk names is judged by the WALK for what its schedule drops**
(the round-1 review's finding H1): :func:`books_reading` asks
:func:`~app.services.recurrence.occurrence_walk` which occurrences the books
drop, and a row is matched to the occurrence it answers by
``occurs_on``, the key the maintain pass matches by -- the same question, of
the same producer, the refusals ask.  A stored day would be wrong for THAT
question, because the regeneration re-dates every row its walk still names.

**Every row is ALSO judged by its OWN day, against the books of the account
it SITS ON** (:func:`own_day_held`; rulings **R-PC96**, **R-PC98** and
**R-PC99**).  R-PC96 (the round-4 review's H1) began it for the rows NO walk
names: a rule-less definition's rows -- an item that no longer repeats, a
one-time transfer -- and a recurring definition's rows answering no
occurrence (``occurs_on`` ``NULL``, a carried-forward leftover) have no
occurrence to look up, and the scope used to restore every one of them:
measured, an archived $50.00 transfer whose cadence was cleared while it was
archived came back due ON its books after a restatement onto that day,
$50.00 counted a second time.  R-PC98 (the round-5 review's H2) added the
ORPHAN, a recurring definition's row whose ``occurs_on`` its CURRENT walk
names nowhere, left behind by a rule edit -- measured, a start moved later
while archived, the books restated onto the second old row's day, and the
unarchive restoring both old rows inside the opening, ``-$20.00`` counted a
second time.  No regeneration re-dates either, so the stored day IS the day:
the one picker (:func:`~app.utils.books_boundary.row_books_day`: the due
day, or the paycheck's last day for an envelope) gives the day
:func:`~app.utils.books_boundary.books_hold` compares.  **R-PC99** (the
round-6 review's H1) fixed WHICH books: the ones of the account the row
sits on (:func:`~app.services.balance_at.row_books_opened_on`), which the
balance counts it in, never its definition's.  A definition's account move
leaves the rows of paychecks that had already ended on the account it left;
measured, that account restated past two such rows committed with the
forecast at ``-$100.00`` where the books rule gives ``-$80.00``, orphans and
named rows alike.  So the own-day judgment asks every hidden row, named or
not, and the walk's judgment above asks the named ones as well.  Every door
that bounds a planned row by the books asks the same two questions, not only
here (``app.services.planned_rows_books``).

**The root is not fixed here.**  An unarchive still restores a row its owner
deleted by hand ABOVE the books, and the conflict chooser revives one (ledger
row **REC-535**): both follow from the shared flag, which ledger row
**REC-536** holds.  Plan step ``recurrence:R22`` designs the from-scratch
model -- a recurring item's unpaid occurrences computed from its schedule and
never stored, only the owner's acts kept -- under which no hidden copy exists
for an unarchive to bring back.

criteria and a sentence out; no Flask symbol, no write, no clock.

"""The recurring transfer funding an account, and what that DEFINITION says.

A single-responsibility leaf helper for the one query three surfaces share --
"does an active recurring transfer template pay INTO this account, and if so
which one?" -- and for the facts read off the template it returns.  It
imports no service at all -- ``db`` and two models -- so the graph stays
acyclic: every consumer of THIS module imports it, and none of them is
reachable from there.  The loan and investment
dashboards use the query to decide whether to show the
set-up-a-recurring-payment prompt, and the loan recurrence-sync uses it to
find the rule whose OPENING bound it re-derives from the loan's contract
(:func:`~app.services.loan_recurrence_sync.sync_loan_payment_start`).
Centralising it keeps those surfaces from drifting on what counts as an
account's recurring funding transfer.

**The loan-payment SETTINGS read moved here at plan step R7d-a**, from
``loan_payment_service``.  It is a read OF this module's own subject -- the
mode a payment is in and the standing extra it carries -- and it was three
call sites away from the query that finds the template it reads.  That module
was at pylint's 1000-line ceiling exactly, so the move is also what stops the
next fact about a definition being paid for by a ``too-many-lines`` disable; a
module's line count going over is a statement that it holds more than one
subject, and this was the second one.  **Its LOAN-LEVEL siblings went at plan
step R7d-g-3** -- ``standing_payment`` / ``StandingPayment`` (the oldest
definition and ITS extra, bundled) and ``loan_standing_extra`` (that extra
alone): each answered a loan-level question by picking ONE definition, the
tie-break ruling **R-R35** wants deleted rather than answered, and the two
readers that priced money off them (the balance seam's resolver and the loan
page's payoff composer, ``loan_resolver.compute_payoff_scenarios``) take no
extra at all now (ruling **R-R88**, which re-ruled R-R83's seam clause at R7d-g-3): a generated row
carries its own definition's extra through amount rule 4, and what no row
covers is priced from every definition's own occurrences by the forward plan.
The settings row is read per DEFINITION, through :func:`loan_payment_config`.

What is deliberately NOT here is how a MATERIALISED row is priced
(``cash_ledger.LoanPricing``): that needs the loan resolved, its rate
periods and its escrow history, which is the AMOUNT MODEL's work -- rule 4 --
and not a read of a definition.  *That rule's producer lived in
``loan_payment_service`` until plan step X-au-g-2a moved it into
``cash_ledger``; this sentence said "the loan seam's work" and now names the
tier that actually owns it.*  **The definition's half of that rule lived here
too, as ``standing_installment_cash``, until plan step R16-b-2 deleted it**
(ruling **R-R67**): it was a copy of the amount model's own arms, measured a
cent apart from them on a loan's last installment (finding **REC-517**), and
an estimate is priced through those arms now
(:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.definition_cash`).

    ``lazy="joined"``, which loads it with the template and then does NOT
    refresh it when the FK column is written: measured on SQLAlchemy 2.0.49,
    a ``setattr(template, "to_account_id", other)`` leaves ``to_account``
    pointing at the OLD account through the following ``flush()`` and only
    re-loads at ``commit()``.  ``routes/transfers/templates.py`` writes
    exactly that -- ``to_account_id`` is in ``_TEMPLATE_UPDATE_FIELDS`` and
    is assigned by ``setattr`` -- and then REGENERATES before committing, so
    a resolver reading the relationship would bound the new destination's
    rows by the OLD loan's payoff.  A pending template is the second state:
    its ``to_account_id`` is set and its ``to_account`` is still ``None``.

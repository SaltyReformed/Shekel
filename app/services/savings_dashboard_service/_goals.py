"""
Shekel Budget App -- Savings Dashboard: savings-goal progress.

Computes per-goal progress, the committed monthly contribution from
recurring transfer templates, and the projected completion trajectory.

**A goal on a DEBT is a milestone to get under** (plan step
credit_card:CC-5-5d, rulings R-CC69..R-CC73, R-CC88, R-CC91, R-CC93): its
progress runs from what the debt owed when the goal was set to its target
(R-CC70); that start is RECORDED at creation for a card or other non-loan debt
(R-CC91) and re-read from the books for a configured loan (R-CC71); and its
projected date is the day the debt first owes at most the target (R-CC73).
Every one of those figures is what the debt's /savings TILE shows on that day
(:func:`._tile.tile_balance_on`, ruling R-CC88), so a goal and the tile above
it cannot disagree.  A goal is a debt goal by its account's category, asked of
the account; nothing on the goal row says so.

No Flask imports.

    A parameter object introduced at plan step R7a-2a, and forced by that
    step's third field: :func:`_compute_goal_progress` and
    :func:`_build_goal_datum` each took five positional arguments, and the
    owner's pay cadence -- which the contribution floor and the income-relative
    target both need -- would have been a sixth on both.  A raised ``max-args``
    is not the project's answer; grouping is, and these three ARE one thing:
    the per-owner facts resolved once for the whole build that no individual
    goal changes.

    Loaded rows and the read pass rather than the whole

    account list it was not built for.

    **It carries the READ PASS since plan step R7d-e, where it carried three
    of the pass's derivations as scalars.**  The committed-contribution filter
    now asks what stops a definition through the composed door -- the rule's
    own bound AND its destination's derived stop -- and the door needs the
    pass to fold a loan.  Keeping the scalars beside the pass would have made
    ``inputs.as_of`` and ``inputs.balance_ctx.as_of`` two spellings of one day
    (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14), and the same for the calendar and the reported
    window, so all three are DERIVED from the pass below instead -- each off a
    memo the pass already holds, so a property costs nothing -- and every

            :attr:`GoalProgress.has_salary_data` reports.
        balance_ctx: The render's read pass.  Its calendar turns
            ``net_biweekly_pay`` into a monthly figure for a "months of
            salary" goal and is the WHOLE schedule ``obligations_aggregator``
            needs to tell whether a contribution template bounded "after N
            occurrences" has spent its count (plan step R7b-3); its reported
            window is what the periods-until-target count walks, the same
            window the account balances beside it were reported over
            (pay-calendar plan step C2-f2d-3); and its ``as_of`` is the

    """One savings goal's progress: where it stands and when it lands.

    The per-goal record the ``/savings`` goal cards and the budget dashboard's
    savings track both reduce over -- two templates, through two packages.  A
    frozen value object since plan step X-w4 (ruling R-CI); it was an ELEVEN-key
    untyped dict, the largest record container on this read path, and its
    contract was stated only in two ``Returns:`` blocks that had to be kept in
    step with each other by hand.

    **One of those eleven keys was read by NOTHING, and it did not become a
    field** -- eleven keys in, ten fields out.  (This said "a TWELFTH key" until
    plan step X-w6's adversarial review recounted the dict it describes, which
    is the "a count in a docstring is a claim" class inside the paragraph that
    deletes a field for being one.)
    ``goal_mode_id`` was a straight copy of ``goal.goal_mode_id`` -- one fact
    under two keys, on a record that already carries the goal -- and an AST
    census over ``app/`` and ``tests/`` found ZERO readers of the copy: every
    ``goal_mode_id`` site in the tree is either the ref-cache accessor
    (``ref_cache.goal_mode_id``), the ORM column, the goal FORM's own field, or
    the create/update schema's payload.  That is finding N-100's defect
    (a published key with no consumer) in a container being typed, so it went
    with the dict rather than being carried into the record.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (11/7) -- suppressed because this
    is a cohesive per-goal display record read flat by two templates, not an
    object accumulating state.  Every field has a named reader (each was
    counted before the record was written), and there is no cohesive sub-group
    to nest: the goal's own columns are read THROUGH ``goal`` rather than
    copied, and the trajectory is already one nested value.  Grouping any of
    the rest would invent a concept to satisfy a count.  Mirrors
    :class:`~.._types.AccountProjection`, whose 8/7 carries the same rationale.

    Attributes:
        goal: The :class:`~app.models.savings_goal.SavingsGoal` row.  Every
            field the cards read off the goal itself -- its name, account,
            target date, manual per-period contribution, and its mode -- is
            read HERE rather than copied onto this record.
        current_balance: The backing account's balance today, taken from that
            account's :class:`~.._types.AccountProjection` so the goal card and
            the account tile cannot report different balances.  HELD, like the
            projection's: a debt's is negative when it owes, and the cards
            render :attr:`shown_balance`.  A debt goal whose account is ARCHIVED
            has no projection and reads the tile's rule directly
            (:func:`.._tile.tile_balance_on`), so it never reads ``$0.00`` owed
            and "met" for a debt that still owes (plan step CC-5-5d).
        progress_pct: Completion percent through the canonical
            :func:`app.utils.money.percent_complete` contract (ROUND_HALF_UP,
            clamped ``[0, 100]``), so this card, the budget-dashboard card and
            the companion entry view report one number for one goal.  A DEBT
            goal's runs from :attr:`start_owed` down to the target (ruling
            R-CC70): what has been paid down since the goal was set over what
            the goal set out to pay down.
        remaining_periods: Pay periods from today to the target date, or
            ``None`` when the goal has no target date.
        required_contribution: The per-period contribution needed to land on
            the target date, or ``None`` when there is no actionable target or
            the date has passed (the card renders "Past target date" for the
            second).  ALWAYS ``None`` for a debt goal, which has no per-period
            figure (ruling R-CC73); the debt card never renders that line.
        resolved_target: The dollar target -- ``target_amount`` for a FIXED
            goal, the income-relative computation for the other mode.
        income_descriptor: The income-relative caption ("3 months of salary"),
            or ``None`` for a fixed goal.  Presentation microcopy composed in
            the service because templates display and never compute.
        has_salary_data: Whether the engine produced a positive net biweekly
            pay.  STORED rather than derived: the pay figure itself is not
            carried here, and an income-relative goal with no salary profile is
            exactly the state the card warns about.
        trajectory: The goal's
            :class:`~app.services.savings_goal_service.GoalTrajectory` -- when
            it lands at the current rate, and how that reads against its target
            date.  **NEVER absent**: its producer has three returns and every
            one fills all four fields.  Plan step X-w4 typed this as
            ``dict | None`` and the goal card guarded it with a truthiness
            test; both were unreachable, and plan step X-aa deleted them with
            the dict (ruling R-CO).  A nullable that cannot be null is ruling
            R-CA's defect; a guard that cannot be false is not a guard.
        monthly_contribution: The committed monthly inflow discovered from the
            recurring transfer templates targeting the goal's account, through
            the one canonical obligations aggregator.  ``None`` for a DEBT goal:
            its date reads the debt's own plan and its card renders no
            contribution (ruling R-CC73), so the figure would have no reader.
        start_owed: For a DEBT goal, what the debt owed when the goal was set,
            as its tile showed it.  A CARD or other non-loan debt's is the
            figure the goal door RECORDED at creation (ruling R-CC91: its tile
            reads the pay period's END, so a later re-read would take in the
            rest of that period); a CONFIGURED loan's is re-read from the books
            on every build (ruling R-CC71), so a back-dated correction moves it.
            ``None`` for a savings goal, which has no start: its progress is
            its balance over its target.

    """Compute savings goal progress, contributions, and trajectory.

    For income-relative goals, the resolved target is calculated from
    the user's net pay, their pay cadence and the goal's multiplier/unit.  For
    fixed goals, the stored target_amount is used directly.

    Trajectory is computed for each SAVINGS goal by discovering the monthly
    contribution from recurring transfer templates targeting the goal's
    account, then projecting the completion date and pace.  A goal on a DEBT
    reads its debt's own plan instead (:func:`_build_debt_goal_datum`).

    Args:
        user_id: Integer ID of the current user.
        account_data: The per-account projections from
            _compute_account_projections.
        inputs: The build's shared per-owner facts (:class:`_GoalInputs`) --
            the pay periods, the net pay for one paycheck, and the pay
            cadence every monthly equivalent here is measured against.
        goals: The user's active :class:`SavingsGoal` instances, already
            loaded by the caller via :func:`_load_active_goals`.  Passed
            in rather than re-queried so the active-goal lookup runs once
            per request, not twice (both entry points already load it).

    Returns:
        One :class:`GoalProgress` per active goal, in *goals* order.

    """Derive the DTI block from monthly debt payments and gross biweekly pay.

    A PURE function returning the whole block or ``None`` (plan step X-s3,
    ruling R-BD).  It used to MUTATE a debt-summary dict, writing three keys in
    one branch and three ``None`` s in the other -- so the "no income data"
    state was spelled three times and read as three predicates by two
    templates, and the summary object was never fully constructed in any one
    place.

    **It takes the MONTHLY gross, and the paycheck-to-monthly conversion moved
    OUT at plan step R7a-2a.**  This function used to take the per-paycheck
    gross and convert it here against a hardcoded
    ``PAY_PERIODS_PER_YEAR / MONTHS_PER_YEAR``, justified as "a structural
    property of the 26-period pay schedule (Shekel is a biweekly app)" -- a
    justification that was false of the schema it described, since
    ``cadence_days`` is user-selectable 1..365.  Giving it the owner's cadence
    instead was the obvious repair and it was the wrong shape twice over: a DTI
    is a ratio of two MONTHLY figures, so the unit conversion was never this
    function's job; and resolving a cadence for it meant reading the owner's
    schedule on a page that answers ``None`` here whenever no salary is
    configured, which put a 500 in front of an owner with a mortgage and no
    salary profile.  The caller converts, behind the one condition that decides
    whether there is anything to convert.

    Args:
        total_monthly_payments: The debt summary's PITI total.
        gross_monthly: Engine-derived gross MONTHLY income, already converted
            from the owner's paycheck at their own cadence and rounded to
            cents by the caller.  ``0.00`` when no salary is configured.

    Returns:
        The :class:`DtiMetrics`, or ``None`` when ``gross_monthly`` is zero --
        no income source, which a consumer must distinguish from a real zero
        ratio (E-12).

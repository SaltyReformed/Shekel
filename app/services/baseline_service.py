"""
Shekel Budget App -- Baseline Scenario Creation + Posting-Ledger Recovery

Creating a user's missing baseline scenario is not a one-row insert, because a
posting ledger is SCENARIO-scoped (``journal_entries.scenario_id``): everything
that wanted to post while the user had no baseline had nowhere to put it and was
skipped.  Minting the scenario is therefore only half the repair; the other half
is re-deriving those skipped corrections from the source facts that outlived the
gap.  This module owns both halves as one transaction, so a caller cannot do the
first and forget the second (which is exactly what
``routes.grid.create_baseline`` did to the loan ledger).

**Why its own module.**  It sits ABOVE both posting packages and
:mod:`app.services.scenario_resolver`, and depends on all three.  It cannot live
in ``scenario_resolver`` -- both posting packages import that module for
``get_baseline_scenario``, so putting this there inverts the layering and pylint
reports the cycle (R0401).  A leaf stays a leaf; the composition lives here.

Flask-isolated: takes a user id, returns a model or ``None``; no ``request`` /
``session``.

    """Create a user's missing baseline scenario, recovering BOTH posting ledgers.

    The recovery path behind ``routes.grid.create_baseline``.  Both per-user
    resyncs run in the SAME transaction as the new scenario, each re-deriving
    its corrections from source facts that outlived the baseline-less gap:

    * **Loans** (:func:`app.services.loan_posting_service.resync_user_loan_postings`)
      -- a loan's opening posts per scenario at params-create
      (``loan_posting_service.sync_loan_postings_all_scenarios`` iterates the
      scenarios the loan is displayed in, and a baseline-less owner has none), so
      a loan configured while the baseline was gone carries no OPENING.  That is
      not a quiet gap: the balance seam REFUSES to answer for an originated loan
      whose ledger was never written
      (:class:`~app.services.posting_reads.LoanLedgerNotOpenedError`), so every
      loan surface 500s until this runs -- and before this recovery existed there
      was no path back short of re-saving the loan's params.  Its ``LoanParams``
      and ``user_trueup`` rows carry no ``pay_period_id`` and survive, so the
      openings and true-ups re-derive exactly.
    * **Non-loan accounts**
      (:func:`app.services.account_posting_service.resync_user_account_anchor_postings`)
      -- an account created without a baseline has its anchor correction skipped
      with a loud log (``account_service.create_account``); its
      ``AccountAnchorHistory`` rows survive, so its opening re-derives too.

    The two are separate calls, not one merged sweep: they answer the same
    question ("re-derive what could not post") from DIFFERENT source facts, and
    each package owns the derivation of its own.

    Idempotent: a user who already has a baseline is left untouched and gets
    ``None``, so a double-submitted form cannot mint a second one (the partial
    unique index ``uq_scenarios_one_baseline`` is the storage-tier backstop).

    Commits -- this is a whole recovery, and a half-applied one would leave the
    loan ledger in exactly the broken state it exists to repair.

    Args:
        user_id: The user whose baseline to create.

    Returns:
        The new :class:`~app.models.scenario.Scenario`, or ``None`` when the user
        already had one (nothing was created and nothing was resynced).

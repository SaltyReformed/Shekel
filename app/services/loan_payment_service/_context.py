"""
Shekel Budget App -- A loan's LOADED context and its payment history.

One account's payments, rate changes, escrow and contractual P&I, loaded once
and shared by every consumer of an amortization schedule
(:func:`load_loan_context`), plus the PRICING of that payment feed
(:func:`get_payment_history`).

**It stopped owning the payment QUERY at plan step balance:X-bl-2a** (finding
**N-432**).  The rows, their chronology and their three dates are
:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.payment_installments` now; what is left here is
the amount, which is the only part of a payment record this tier is qualified to
answer.  That is what lets the schedule replay -- three dates, no amount -- reach
the feed without the amount model behind it.

Sits above :mod:`._engine_prep`, whose two corrections it applies to the feed
before returning it, and BELOW the amount model: since plan step X-au-g-2c both
functions here take the read pass's
:class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis` and
:func:`get_payment_history` prices its rows through it.  That import direction
is what plan step X-au-g-2a bought by moving amount rule 4's producer down into
``cash_ledger``; the argument is written once, in
:mod:`app.services.cash_ledger._loan_installment`.

            escrow ONCE PER INSTALLMENT in both producers (developer,
            2026-09-01).  Two earlier remedies were measured wrong first:
            re-keying this to the installment (tried at X-au-g-2b, a

    account via transfers.

    **It is the JOIN of two producers since plan step balance:X-bl-2a, and owns
    neither** (finding **N-432**).  The rows, their order and their three dates
    are :func:`app.services.loan_ledger.payment_installments`; the figures are
    :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id`.  What is left here is
    the pairing.  Splitting it that way is what lets a consumer that needs only
    the chronology -- the schedule replay, which reads three dates and no amount
    -- take the installments alone: this function's import closure is the amount
    model's -- **98 modules at ``e74f7d6d`` and 101 here, against the 42 / 45 the
    replay's own tier needs** (2026-09-09; the package split moved both numbers,
    and the metric is stated in
    :mod:`app.services.loan_ledger._installments`) -- and every one of those
    modules is a module the reconciliation oracle's independent reference still
    has to be right about, until ``X-bl-2b`` moves it off this door.

    **That split also deletes the SECOND producer of a loan's settled history.**
    This function read the status column itself (``txn.status.is_settled``) while
    :func:`app.services.loan_loaders.settled_income_shadows` -- which calls
    itself the project's single such derivation -- filtered on
    ``settled_status_ids()``.  The two agreed by a pinned parity, which is rule
    14's tell rather than its answer; the installment producer reads that loader
    and the projected one, so settled-ness is decided by which set a row arrived
    in and this file states no rule about it at all.

    **It prices its rows through the AMOUNT MODEL, and routing this ONE reader
    is what finding N-266(a) was** (plan step X-au-g-2c).  Every other reader of
    a loan payment already went through the resolver; this one read the
    accessor now called
    :func:`~app.services.row_valuation.settled_contribution` -- then
    ``owned_contribution``, a name asserting the row owned its figure -- and
    that accessor REFUSED a row whose
    plan is DERIVED.  So the loan-side INCOME leg could not be declared derived
    while this call stood -- not because anything was circular, but because one
    reader had never been routed.  The bound is deleted rather than worked
    around: this asks
    :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id`, which answers a
    derived row from its producer and an OWN row from the plan column that
    accessor then read.

    **It is BYTE-IDENTICAL on every row that exists today, and that is a
    measurement rather than an expectation.**  Both accessors gate on
    :func:`~app.services.row_valuation.fixed_contribution` first -- ``0`` for a
    row that does not contribute, the SETTLEMENT for a row whose money has moved
    -- so they could differ only on an unsettled row, where one read the row's
    own column and the other dispatches.  A row carrying no
    ``amount_source_id`` dispatches to ``AmountRule.OWN``, whose answer is that
    same column read.  *Both sides CALLED ``owned_amount`` until plan step X-bu
    deleted that accessor, and the identity was STRUCTURAL then -- one function,
    two callers.  X-bu made it two textual copies over a shared leaf, a cost it
    took knowingly and named; plan step **X-bx** discharged it by deleting the
    accessor's copy outright, so the amount model's own arm is the one
    statement again and the leaf is private to it (``_amount_source
    ._own_figure``).  The unsettled row this paragraph turns on no longer has
    two answers to compare: the accessor REFUSES it and only
    ``contributions_by_id`` answers.*  Measured against production 2026-09-01 (stamp
    ``a4c6f1d92b73``): **all 58 loan-side income shadows** -- 29 Mortgage, 29
    Van Loan -- and all 175 transfers carry ``amount_source_id IS NULL``, so
    every row in this feed takes that arm.  What changes is only what a row the
    NEXT leaf declares derived does here: it resolves, where it used to raise.

    **One ORDERING is different and it is stated rather than left to be met.**
    Dating now happens WHOLLY BEFORE pricing, because the installment producer
    runs first.  On a feed carrying BOTH a row with a broken settle day and a
    row the amount model refuses, the exception a caller sees is
    ``UndatedSettleError`` whichever comes first in the feed.  Plan step
    X-au-g-2c had flipped that to ``AmountUnresolvable`` by pricing the whole
    feed before dating any of it, and X-bl-2a flips it back.  Both are loud, both
    are named below, and neither is recoverable -- but "byte identical" is a
    claim about VALUES, and this is the one place it is not also a claim about
    which refusal arrives first.

    **It asks the BATCH, and the reason is consistency rather than cost.**
    ``contributions_by_id`` is a comprehension over ``contribution_of``, so it
    is per row underneath; what stops 29 rows resolving the same loan 29 times
    is the memo on the BASIS (``LoanPricing._loan``), which a per-row loop over
    the same basis would get too.  *A first draft of this paragraph credited
    the batch for that saving, which is wrong and worth correcting rather than
    quietly deleting: the batch is taken because every other reader of a row
    set takes it, so a figure cannot differ by which caller asked.*

    **There is no Decimal coercion below, and its removal is part of the
    route.**  The line here read *"Defensive: ensure Decimal even if the stored
    column somehow yields a non-Decimal"* -- padding around a raw column read.
    The amount model is TOTAL in its answer: every rule returns a ``Decimal`` or
    raises, and the OWN rule's leaf (``cash_ledger._amount_source._own_figure``,
    which plan step X-bx moved there from ``row_valuation``) refuses a missing
    figure rather than substituting one.  A coercion after it would convert a
    state the model refuses into a silent number.

    **That is not finding N-259**, which was a WRITE-BACK cycle one layer up and
    is CLOSED: a settle used to refresh the amount, so a settle / revert /
    settle compounded the standing extra.  Plan step ``balance:X-au-c3``
    (`3d1379d1`) made a settle RECORD what moved instead, so that compounding is
    no longer reproducible.  It is named only because conflating the two is what
    kept N-266(a)'s bound alive as a "cycle" long after the path was deleted.

    Each record carries all three of a loan payment's dates (see
    :class:`~app.services.amortization_engine.PaymentRecord`), copied verbatim
    off its :class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.PaymentInstallment` and derived
    nowhere near here: ``payment_date`` is the pay-period start (the funding
    basis), ``due_date`` is the installment it satisfies, from the ONE
    derivation the genesis write walk also uses
    (:func:`app.services.loan_loaders.loan_payment_due_date`), and
    ``settled_on`` is the day the cash moved, from the ONE derivation the
    genesis fold dates that payment's principal by
    (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.payment_visible_on`).

    The ``due_date`` here is the payment's OWN installment, never the schedule
    slot :func:`app.services.amortization_engine.schedule_dates` may invent for it: the
    slot is assigned by :func:`._engine_prep.prepare_payments_for_engine`, after
    the escrow subtraction has keyed on the real one.

    **Deriving the DUE date or the CASH day from the pay period has cost a
    defect each** -- the first mis-dated a late payment to the following
    month, the second was finding **N-187**, where an early payment was history
    to the ledger and a plan to the resolver at the same instant.  The funding
    basis has cost none: it decides only the replay's rate lookup, which finding
    **N-36** records as deliberate and step X-n owns.

    **Status and settle day are arbitrated ONE TIER DOWN, and since plan step
    balance:X-bl-2a they are arbitrated once rather than agreeably twice.**
    :func:`app.services.loan_ledger.payment_installments` reads the fold's own
    settled set, then REQUIRES the day, because
    :func:`~app.utils.balance_predicates.settled_day` (inside
    ``payment_visible_on``) refuses a settled row carrying none rather than
    inventing one.  A row broken the other way -- Projected but still carrying a
    stale day, which only a seam bypass can produce -- arrives in the PROJECTED
    set and its day is never read, so the record cannot report it as confirmed.
    ``PaymentRecord.is_confirmed`` is that absence.  What this file used to hold
    was a second reading of the status column beside the loader's, and its
    defence was that the two ran in the same ORDER -- a maintenance contract
    where there is now one producer.

    Args:
        account_id: The debt account receiving payments.
        basis: The read pass's :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis`.
            It SCOPES the query (``basis.scenario_id``) as well as pricing the
            rows, so the feed and its figures cannot come from two scenarios --
            the pairing ``resolve_transaction_amount`` refuses a row for, made
            unconstructible here rather than checked.
        payment_day: The loan's contractual day-of-month due day
            (:attr:`app.models.loan_params.LoanParams.payment_day`), used only
            to reconstruct the due date of a shadow that stores none.

    Returns:
        List of PaymentRecord instances sorted by payment date
        (ascending).  Empty list if no qualifying transactions exist.

    Raises:
        AmountUnresolvable: From the resolver, for a row whose rule cannot
            answer -- a DERIVE-mode payment whose loan will not resolve, or a
            row whose ownership CHECK is broken.  A refusal is never a fallback
            (see :mod:`app.services.cash_ledger._amount_source`).
        UndatedSettleError: When a shadow in a settled status carries no
            ``settled_on`` -- the settled-iff-dated invariant is broken on that
            row, and dating it by a fallback would put real money on a day
            nothing recorded (see :func:`app.utils.balance_predicates.settled_day`).
            **The mark-paid door no longer reaches this, and that is a
            refusal plan step X-au-g-1 DELETED rather than an edge it kept.**
            The paragraph here used to record the door arriving through
            :meth:`~app.services.cash_ledger.LoanPricing.live_cash` ->
            :func:`load_loan_context`; that edge is gone with the pricing cycle,
            so a settle now reaches pricing via ``transfer_service._settle`` ->
            ``amount_basis`` -> amount rule 4 and never loads a payment history.
            *That path named ``live_cash`` until plan step X-au-g-2c-2 deleted
            it with the read-time repair; the conclusion -- no payment history
            on the settle path -- is unchanged.*
            The three remaining callers of :func:`load_loan_context` are
            ``routes/loan/_helpers.py`` (twice) and
            ``balance_at/_resolution.py``.

            The row is still broken on every other surface -- the sibling cash
            leg refuses at ``cash_ledger._events`` and the loan fold at
            ``loan_ledger._visible`` -- so no loan carrying such a shadow is
            silently healthy; what changed is only WHICH door reports it
            first.  Stated rather than quietly dropped, because a refusal that
            stops being reachable from a door is a behaviour change even when
            every other reader still refuses.

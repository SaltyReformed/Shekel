"""
Shekel Budget App -- Debt Strategy Service

Pure-function service for cross-account debt payoff strategy calculations.
Implements three strategies for allocating extra payments across multiple
debts:

  1. Avalanche -- targets the highest interest rate first.  Minimizes
     total interest paid (mathematically optimal).
  2. Snowball -- targets the smallest balance first.  Provides faster
     initial payoffs for psychological motivation.
  3. Custom -- targets debts in a user-specified priority order.

The service receives debt data as DebtAccount instances and returns a
StrategyResult with per-account payoff timelines and aggregate metrics.
No database access, no Flask imports -- this is a pure function service
that the route layer calls with pre-fetched data.

ARM limitation (R-5): This service uses a fixed interest rate per debt.
ARM rate adjustments during the payoff period are not incorporated into
the strategy projection.  The current rate from LoanParams is used as-is.

Shekel Budget App -- Authentication Service

Handles password hashing, verification, breached-password checking,
account lockout, and user registration.  No Flask imports -- this is a
pure service module.  Configuration that needs to be runtime-tunable
(lockout threshold, lockout duration, HIBP toggle) is read via
``os.getenv`` at function-call time so the test suite can override
each value through ``monkeypatch.setenv`` without going through the
Flask config object.  Defaults documented alongside the matching
``BaseConfig`` settings in ``app/config.py``.

    """Verify a plaintext password against a bcrypt hash.

    Defensive hardening (commit C-44 / audit finding F-083): the
    previous guard only short-circuited on ``plain_password is None``,
    so any other falsy-but-not-None value (empty string, ``bytes``,
    ``int``, ``Decimal``, ``list``, ...) reached ``.encode("utf-8")``
    and raised ``AttributeError`` which propagated as a 500.  This
    function now fails closed on every non-string input.

    Specifically:

    * ``plain_password`` must be a non-empty ``str``.  Non-string
      types (``None``, ``bytes``, ``int``, ``Decimal``, sequences,
      mappings) and the empty string both return ``False`` without
      reaching bcrypt.  Every authentication route gates on a
      Marshmallow schema with ``min=1`` length (``LoginSchema``,
      ``ReauthSchema``, ``MfaDisableSchema``, ``ChangePasswordSchema``),
      so an empty plaintext only reaches this function when the
      caller is broken; treating it as a non-match is safer than
      round-tripping bcrypt's empty-string hash.
    * ``password_hash`` must be a non-empty ``str``.  Same rejection
      set as ``plain_password`` -- a non-string or empty hash cannot
      be a valid bcrypt digest, so the lookup never had to reach
      bcrypt anyway.
    * A ``password_hash`` that is a non-empty ``str`` but does not
      parse as a bcrypt hash (corrupted DB row, hash from an older
      incompatible scheme, manual operator typo) raises
      ``ValueError`` ("Invalid salt") inside ``bcrypt.checkpw``.
      The catch below converts it to ``False`` so a corrupted row
      cannot crash the login flow.  Operators observe the corruption
      via the lockout-counter increment in :func:`authenticate` and
      the structured ``account_locked`` log event once the threshold
      trips.

    All failure modes return the same ``False`` value -- "wrong
    type", "empty string", "corrupted hash", and "wrong password"
    are indistinguishable at the call site so an attacker probing
    with exotic payloads cannot use response shape to fingerprint
    caller-side bugs.

        ``AuthError`` with a message that explicitly says the account
        is disabled.  We have already proven knowledge of the
        password, so this branch is not an information leak.

        ``failed_login_count`` to 0 and clear ``locked_until`` (a
        successful login implicitly closes any prior lockout
        window).  Commit only when the reset is non-trivial so

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence Engine: bringing generated rows back into line

:func:`regenerate_for_template` and the pass behind it.  Run when a template's
amount, schedule or fields change, it MAINTAINS the rows the definition already
generated: a row the rule still names is updated in place, a period the rule
names with no row gets one, and a row the rule no longer names is retired --
unless the owner has records against it, in which case the pass leaves it
exactly as it found it and asks.

**Until plan step R10-a this deleted every auto-generated row in the window and
generated replacements** (ruling **R-R19**, finding **N-292**).  That was safe
only while a generated row was a pure projection of ``(template, period)``, and
it has not been one for a long time: ``transaction_entries`` CASCADE from their
parent, so an edit as small as a rename destroyed the PURCHASES recorded
against a part-spent envelope -- measured on a production clone at 3 records
worth ``$499.82``, taken with no prompt and an ``overridden_conflict_count`` of
0.  It also dropped ``notes``, ``is_envelope``, ``companion_visible``,
``actual_amount``, ``created_at`` and the row's own id.

The decision and the write are separate on purpose
(:func:`~app.services._recurrence_common.classify_maintain_work` reads,
:func:`_apply_maintain_work` writes), so what a regeneration decides can be
asserted without a database write.  **The decision itself is SHARED with the
transfer engine since plan step R10-b** and lives in
:mod:`app.services._recurrence_common`; what stays here is what is about this
table -- what a generated row's definition says, what "the owner's records"
means on it, and the write.

    """Bring a template's future rows into line with its current definition.

    Run when a template's amount, schedule or fields change.  **It MAINTAINS
    the rows the rule still names rather than destroying and rebuilding them**,
    which is plan step R10-a and ruling **R-R19**, closing finding **N-292**.

    Four outcomes, one per period the pass considers:

      1. the rule names the period and an auto-generated row is there -- the
         row is UPDATED in place from :class:`DerivedRowFields` and its
         postings reconciled;
      2. the rule names the period and nothing is there -- a row is created,
         exactly as :func:`generate_for_template` would;
      3. the rule NO LONGER names the period -- the row is removed if it is
         empty, and RETAINED as a conflict if the owner has records against it;
      4. the row answers NO occurrence at all (``occurs_on`` is NULL) -- it is
         left exactly as found and RETAINED as a conflict, because the
         definition has moved past a row it cannot place (finding
         **REC-516**).

    Overridden and soft-deleted rows are conflicts wherever they sit, as
    before; immutable rows are never touched.

    **Until plan step R10-a this deleted every auto-generated row in the window
    and generated replacements**, which was safe only while a generated row was
    a pure projection of ``(template, period)``.  It has not been one for a
    long time: ``transaction_entries`` CASCADE from their parent, so the sweep
    destroyed the PURCHASES recorded against a part-spent envelope -- measured
    on a production clone at 3 records worth ``$499.82``, taken silently by an
    edit as small as a rename, with ``overridden_conflict_count`` reporting 0.
    It also dropped ``notes``, ``is_envelope``, ``companion_visible``,
    ``actual_amount``, ``created_at`` and the row's own id, and the lost id is
    why plan step X-f3b had to reverse a row's ledger legs on the way out.  A
    row the rule still names is now never deleted, so none of that is reachable
    on this path and no future column has to be remembered either.

    **Maintaining is not a behaviour change for a row with nothing on it, and
    that is provable rather than hoped for.**  ``Projected`` is the ONLY
    non-immutable status in ``ref.statuses``, so this pass can reach nothing
    else, and an update writes exactly the values a recreation would have
    written -- measured at 504 of 505 live sweepable rows identical, the 505th
    being the one that keeps its purchases.

    **The pass and the rule share ONE bound and ONE domain, and since
    pay-calendar plan step C2-f3c both are structural rather than upheld.**
    They shared the bound before it too -- ``resolve_generation_plan`` resolved
    the ORM row before applying it, so both halves read the same STORED
    ``end_date`` -- and an adversarial review of C2-f3c corrected a draft of
    this paragraph that claimed otherwise.  What changed is that both now read
    the DERIVED end, off the same calendar, because plan step **C4-c** dropped the
    column they used to agree on.

    What ``regeneration_bound`` actually existed for was narrower: the sweep
    was SQL, and ``end_date >= NULL`` matches no row, so "no lower bound" had
    to become a concrete date before it could be compared against a column at
    all -- and the date it became had to be the WRITE WINDOW's opening, because
    a sweep bounded by the SCHEDULE's opening would have reached every
    non-override row from the owner's first payday forward while the rule was
    resolved only inside the window, retiring rows nothing would recreate.  A
    period-ID set taken from that same window
    (``_recurrence_common.rows_this_pass_may_maintain``) needs no translation
    for ``None`` and cannot exceed the window whatever the bound is, so both
    halves of that helper's job are gone and the helper with them.

    Args:
        template:       The updated TransactionTemplate.
        schedule:       The owner's
                        :class:`~app.services.generation_schedule.GenerationSchedule`.
        scenario_id:    The target scenario.
        effective_from: Date from which to maintain, or ``None`` for the whole
                        write window.  The row select and the rule take it
                        unchanged, and read it against the same derived end.

    Returns:
        List of newly created Transaction objects.  Rows this pass UPDATED are
        not in it, so the value keeps the meaning every caller already reads it
        with.

        RecurrenceConflict: When rows exist that this pass must not change
            unasked.  The caller should catch it, present the options, and call
            :func:`resolve_conflicts`.

def _rows_holding_owner_records(existing) -> set[int]:
    """Return the ids of rows carrying content their template did not put there.

    "The owner's own records" is what finding **N-292** is about: a generated
    row is not a pure projection of ``(template, period)``, and the columns
    below are the ones a regeneration cannot reconstruct.  Purchases are the
    costly one -- ``transaction_entries`` CASCADE from their parent, so the old
    delete-and-recreate sweep destroyed them, measured at 3 records worth
    ``$499.82`` on one live row.

    **The ENTRIES are asked in ONE query, not one per row.**  A regeneration
    considers every future row of a template -- 505 of them across the live
    templates on a production clone -- so reading ``row.entries`` in the
    classifier would issue a query per row on the hot path of every template
    edit.

    **The entries are the whole answer for money, and that is structural
    rather than upheld** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-2``, rulings
    **R-BAL80**, **R-BAL82**).  A row's family of movements is every record
    of what its money did: a person's purchases, and the settle's own
    covering movement, which a revert un-dates and KEEPS (plan step
    X-bi-3e-2) -- so a row the owner settled at a figure and then set back
    to Projected, mutable to this sweep, still holds that movement, and the
    retained figure (a number read off a bank statement) is held back as a
    CONFLICT for the owner to resolve.  A ``$0.00`` close keeps no movement
    and is retained by nothing across a revert (R-BAL82), so a reverted
    close of nothing follows its template freely, as a row that never
    settled does.  The arm read the row's own ``settled_basis_id`` from
    plan step X-au-c3 until X-bi-4b-2 deleted that column: the same fact in
    two homes, and this predicate was one of the two readers keeping them
    in step.

    **A STATEMENT LINK counts too, and it needs no condition of its own** --
    which plan step R10-b measured, correcting what R10-a's own adversarial
    review concluded here.  The account-move half of the retention rule is
    justified by two composite keys that scope a clearing link BY ACCOUNT
    (``fk_transaction_entries_reconciled_by`` on the purchase and
    ``fk_transactions_reconciled_by`` on the row itself), so a linked row must
    be retained -- and it already is.  ``ck_transactions_cleared_needs_settle_day``
    says a link needs a settle day, and no row this pass can see carries one:
    ``Projected`` is the only status the pass reaches (the module docstring),
    and the seam releases the day and the link together on the way out of the
    settled band (``status_seam.apply_status_change``).  A row that carries a
    link is settled, and a settled row's money is its entries, held by the
    query above.  Were a linked row ever handed here, the composite key
    itself refuses the account move rather than applying it.  (Until plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-4b-2`` the chain ran one link further --
    ``ck_transactions_settle_day_needs_a_record`` made a settle day imply a
    ``settled_basis_id`` -- and rested on that column's arm.)

    about the model rather than about maintenance (plan step R10-b).

    Applying such a move is what the retention rule refuses on a row holding

    account to its parent's, so moving the row drags every purchase onto the new
    account, and ``fk_transaction_entries_reconciled_by`` scopes a clearing link

    it holds (defect **D16**) and the route gates the sweep on "the

    money's category or account.  Ownership is written as a declaration and

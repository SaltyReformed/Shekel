Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence Engine: applying the owner's conflict decisions

:func:`resolve_conflicts`, called by the route layer after the owner answers
the chooser a :class:`~app.exceptions.RecurrenceConflict` raised.

**Nothing here deletes.**  "Keep" leaves the row untouched and "use" clears the
override / soft-delete flags and hands the row back to its definition, so a row
that reaches the chooser survives whichever branch the owner picks.  **"Use"
un-deletes only what the definition's unarchive would restore** (ruling
**R-BAL253**, developer 2026-10-09): a deleted row its books hold is left
deleted and untouched, and named
(:func:`~app.services.definition_unarchive.restored_by_use`, the one rule the
transfer twin asks too).

**"Use" WRITES NO FIGURE, and that is plan step X-au-e** (ruling **R-JD**).
Every generated transaction row is derived now, so "move this instance to the
template's amount" has no amount to move it to: the act is to stop overriding,
and the definition's own effective-dated series then prices the row as of its
OWN due date.  That is what closes finding **N-244** -- the old "use" wrote the
template's CURRENT ``default_amount`` onto a row whose due date could precede
the edit and cleared the flag that would have marked it, so a $100 history with
one row resolved to $120 read as THREE price changes where one occurred.  A
figure it does not write is a figure it cannot back-date.

**The DECISION survives even though the collision it once mediated cannot
occur** (ruling **R-JD**, developer 2026-09-03).  X-au-e's specification had it
deleted outright, on the ground that a hand-edited month owns its figure and a
regeneration that writes no figure cannot overwrite one.  Both halves of that
are true and neither reaches the offer: ``txn.is_override = False`` below is the
only writer in ``app/`` that clears that flag on a TEMPLATE-LINKED transaction,
and likewise its only per-row un-delete outside archiving and unarchiving the
whole template.

*The qualifier is load-bearing and a first draft omitted it.*  An AST census of
every writer of the two flags finds nine that clear one, not six: besides the
create paths, ``transfer_service._update`` and ``._restore``
clear ``is_override`` on a shadow through a VARIABLE
(``shadow.is_override = flag``), which a grep for the literal cannot see, and
``._restore`` un-deletes both legs.
Those doors reach SHADOWS only, and ``ck_transactions_one_pricing_link`` makes
``transfer_id`` exclusive with ``template_id`` -- so the conclusion holds by the
schema rather than by the count, which is the stronger ground anyway.

Deleting the decision would have stranded every
overridden row permanently OWN, 40 of them on the 2026-09-03 production clone,
with no route back to the definition until plan step X-au-h reworks the flag.

**It answers the OVERRIDDEN and SOFT-DELETED conflicts only, never a RETAINED
one.**  ``RecurrenceConflict.retained`` (plan step R10-a) names rows a maintain
pass left untouched because the owner has records against them, and there is no
keep-vs-use question to put to the owner about such a row: the pass already
took the only safe outcome.  The route reports them with
``flash_retained_notice`` and does not render the chooser for them, and
``apply_conflict_decisions`` allow-lists ``overridden | deleted``, so a
retained id cannot reach this module even from a crafted form.

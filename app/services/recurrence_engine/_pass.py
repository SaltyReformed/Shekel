"""
Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence Engine: ONE regeneration pass, for both engines.

:func:`regenerate_definition` -- what "bring this definition's rows into line
with its current definition" MEANS -- and the record each engine states to say
which five acts are its own (:class:`MaintainActs`).  Its decision is read
without the write by :func:`preview_regeneration`, for an edit door grading
the state a save would leave (plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``).

**This module exists because plan step balance:X-au-d deleted the last
difference between the two engines' regenerate paths.**  The transaction engine
threaded a salary profile and a calendar through its own copy so that
generation could price a paycheck; a salary row is DECLARED now and generation
prices nothing, after which the two bodies were the same code twice --
``pylint``'s ``duplicate-code`` reported both the maintain body and the
generate loop the moment the thread came out.  ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14 is a rule
about VALUES, and this is the same rule one tier up: one behaviour, one home.

**IT DELETED A FENCE.**  ``transfer_recurrence.regenerate_for_template``
carried a documented ``# pylint: disable=duplicate-code`` over its audit-log
and conflict-raise tail, whose rationale recorded that extracting a shared log
helper had been TRIED and REVERTED (one parameter per ``log_event`` field
trips ``too-many-arguments``, and the call site re-duplicates the kwargs).
That attempt failed because it tried to share the LOGGING; what actually
differs between the two engines is three strings and a logger, which
:class:`PassReporting` carries as one value.  With the whole pass shared there
is no duplication left to disable, so the disable is gone rather than widened.

**Why it lives in this package rather than in ``_recurrence_common``.**  The
shared pass resolves the generation plan (:func:`._plan.resolve_generation_plan`),
which lives here; a module under ``_recurrence_common`` reaching for it would
close an import cycle, and reaching for it through a private module of another
package is what ``shekel-private-module-import`` forbids.  The transfer engine
already imports ``resolve_generation_plan`` from this
package and its own docstring calls itself "a deliberate parallel" of it, so
the direction is established rather than new.  ``_recurrence_common`` keeps
what is genuinely model-agnostic and free of a plan -- the classification, the
row fetches, the ownership checks -- and was at 870 of its 1,000-line ceiling
with this family in it.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture / B6-01): ORM rows and plain
data in, plain data out; no Flask import.  It FLUSHES (both engines' writers
do), and it does not commit.

    hold on, how the derivation is keyed, what the outcome reports -- and the
    last thing keeping the two bodies apart was the salary thread this module's
    docstring names.

    Each engine states these ONCE, at module level, and

    engines genuinely differ -- a transaction has one account and a transfer

    landing period happened to be named it silently re-derived the row's amount

    It also collapsed a repeated paycheck: two placements sharing one period
    kept only the last one's fields, so at a pay cadence of 30 days or more

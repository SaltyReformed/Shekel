"""
Shekel Budget App -- The shape a SETTLE arm of the outstanding set has

What the two arms whose tick SETTLES something share: the transaction arm (an
envelope's own close, and a bill -- on this account, or planned on another with
its payment here) and the transfer arm (a transfer's leg on this account).
Both ask *which of these had the bank not yet taken from this account by the
statement's day*, bound it by the same landing day, and settle what was ticked
through a per-item service verb -- and differ in WHICH items are theirs, how
they are loaded, and what a tick MEANS for one.

**This is finding N-225 fixed rather than paid.**  That row was opened by
X-f2-c2's own adversarial design review, which measured the package's stated
cut: :mod:`app.services.reconcile_service` says it has "three row kinds whose
settle verbs are genuinely different", and only ONE of the three is different
in shape.  A PURCHASE settles by stamping one column, so its arm's scope is
over :class:`~app.models.transaction_entry.TransactionEntry` and its writer is
a bulk ``UPDATE`` (:mod:`._purchases`).  The other two are both "load what is
in scope, narrow in Python by attribution date, loop dispatching to a per-item
service verb" -- so building the transfer arm by copying the transaction arm
would have put ~250 lines of one scope into two files that can then drift
about what "outstanding" means, on a screen that moves money.

**The WRITER is here too, and this leaf had to be argued out of leaving it per
arm.**  N-225 named the shared shape as *(extra scope clause, settle callable,
OfferKind)*; X-f2-c3's first design read that as over-reach and kept each arm's
loop, on the argument that it was six lines of glue around one rule.  Writing
the second one settled it: pylint's cross-file ``duplicate-code`` check
reported the pair twice -- first the telemetry tails, then the whole body once
those were shared -- because the two loops were not similar, they were the same
function.  The finding was right and the first reading of it was not.

So :func:`record_settled` narrows the ticked ids through the arm's own loader,
settles each item through the arm's own verb, counts what that verb says was a
HUMAN's correction (finding **N-231**), and reports how much of what was asked
for landed.  What stays the arm's is :class:`Arm`.

**The two arms stopped sharing a TABLE at leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-2``**, and
that is why an arm now states a LOADER rather than a clause.  Until then both
queried ``budget.transactions`` and partitioned it on ``transfer_id`` -- the
transfer arm offered a transfer's SHADOW row -- so an arm was its membership
clause over one shared query.  The transfer arm offers the transfer's LEG now,
loaded off ``budget.transfers`` (``transfer_legs.offerable_transfer_legs``), so
no clause over this module's query can describe it.  What is still shared is
the day bound (:func:`attributed_on` / :func:`lands_on_or_before`, over the
row a leg is filed by -- its transfer), the writer, and the value naming the
statement.  The ROW scope and loader (:func:`outstanding_scope`,
:func:`outstanding_rows`, :func:`wholly_spent_by`) stay here beside them as
the transaction arm's, which since plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4b`` asks them
for TWO scopes: the rows on this account, and the rows planned on another
whose kept payment is on this one (the panel's "Paid from this account").

Architecture (``CLAUDE.md``):
  - No Flask imports.  Plain data in, ORM rows out.
  - The reads are pure.  :func:`record_settled` MUTATES through the arms'
    service verbs and does NOT commit -- the caller owns the session boundary.

class Statement:
    """The bank statement being reconciled: whose, which account, which ASSERTION.

    The facts every function in this package takes together, as one value.  They
    are not independent -- an assertion declares the real balance of ONE account
    on ONE civil day for ONE owner, and a call site that could pair one
    account's id with another day's would be a call site that can reconcile
    against a statement nobody read.

    **It carried a bare ``observed_on`` until plan step X-f3a-1** and now
    carries the ASSERTION, with the day derived from it.  Ruling **R-FL** makes
    a tick record WHICH statement showed the money, and a civil day cannot name
    one: production carries three days on which Checking holds two or three
    assertions.  The day is a property rather than a second field for the reason
    the value exists at all -- two fields that must agree are two fields a
    caller can mismatch, and here the mismatch would stamp a line with a
    statement it was not measured against.

    **It carried a bare ``owner_id`` until pay-calendar plan step C4-a-2** and
    now carries that owner's CALENDAR, with the id derived from it, for exactly
    the same reason one line up.  This package has to date every row it offers
    (:func:`attributed_on`), and a pay period's span is DERIVED -- so the
    calendar arrived as a fact this value needs.  Carrying both an ``owner_id``
    and a calendar would have been two statements of whose rows these are, and
    the mismatch -- one owner's rows dated against another owner's paydays --
    produces a plausible wrong day rather than an error.  Every scope clause in
    this module now reads its owner THROUGH the calendar it dates by.

            resolved by the ROUTE and threaded (this package holds no read pass
            of its own).  It answers two questions here: whose rows may be
            offered or settled (:attr:`owner_id`), and which span each offered
            row is budgeted in (:func:`attributed_on`).
        account_id: The cash account whose balance was asserted.
        anchor: The governing :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AnchorPoint` --
            the assertion being reconciled against.  Its ``anchor_id`` is what a
            tick writes into ``reconciled_by_id``, and its ``observed_on`` is the
            day every tick records -- as a BOUND, which :attr:`settle_day` is

        anything.  Whether this scope should become one equality on that
        column, or stay the calendar's saved ids, is a question with an
        answer already: what this scope needs is the PERIOD SET and not the
        owner, so ``Transaction.user_id`` cannot replace it.  It is also NOT
        one of finding **P75**'s nineteen -- that census counts reads that
        REFUSE and excludes scopes by name -- and the clause is graded:
        deleting ``_purchases.py``'s copy of it fails
        ``test_the_PURCHASE_arm_is_scoped_the_same_way`` (measured
        2026-09-02).  A ``C13-b`` that treated it as a comparison to retire
        would delete load-bearing code.  **``C13-b`` did not** (2026-09-03):
        it moved the ELEVEN reads that walk a row's paycheck for its owner and
        the EIGHT that refetch a submitted period, and left every SCOPE --
        this one and ``statement_match._candidates``' two -- exactly as it
        found them.

        **The "is this period SAVED" filter is the CALENDAR's own** since
        pay-calendar plan step C4-a-4:
        :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.saved_by_id` states it,
        and this property and :attr:`offerable_period_ids` beside it each wrote
        ``period_id is not None`` for themselves until then -- two spellings of
        one predicate inside one class, in a package that owns neither.

        **What it buys is a REFUSAL becoming unconstructible rather than
        merely unlikely.**  A row this scope admits names a period the calendar
        was built from, so :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.require_period`
        -- which :func:`attributed_on` and
        :func:`~._assemble._block_headings` both call, on these rows -- cannot
        answer for a period the calendar lacks.  That is the rule
        ``require_period``'s own docstring states: *where the precondition is
        carried by the QUERY, the total form is honest; where it rests on two
        reads agreeing, it is not.*  It is also the shape
        ``statement_match._candidates._transaction_candidates`` already has,
        for the same reason and at the same scale.

        **The state it makes inexpressible is REACHABLE, which is why this is
        not decoration** (balance finding **N-358**).  Under ``READ COMMITTED``
        a command's post-write re-render is a second snapshot, and ``/grid``
        and ``/dashboard`` append paydays AND generate rows into them inside
        one ``write_transaction`` (``routes/grid/page.py``,
        ``routes/_period_population.py``, ruling **R-R38**).  So a concurrent
        render on a lapsed schedule can create a period dated on or before the
        statement's day and file projected rows in it between this request's
        calendar read and its row read.  Scoped by ``pay_periods.user_id`` the
        query returns those rows and the span lookup raises; scoped by the
        calendar's own ids it does not ask about them, which is the answer the
        request would have given had the concurrent write not landed.

        Returns:
            The owner's saved period ids.  A projected period carries no id and
            is not here; the empty set for an owner with no paydays, which

    * contributing and not soft-deleted -- the shared gate above.
    * the parent period is one of :attr:`Statement.offerable_period_ids` --

    **The account clause is each scope's own since plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-5-4b``** (ruling **R-CC44**), where it was the first
    clause here, "the row is on THIS account".  What it protects is
    unchanged: a balance assertion declares the real balance of one account,
    and a user may hold more than one checking account, so a tick must book
    only money this account's statement could show.  The two scopes tie that
    money to this account two ways -- the row's own account for a row on it
    (the tick books its payment here, the statement's account being the
    tender), the kept PAYMENT's account for a row planned on another (a bill
    paid from this card and reopened) -- and one clause here could state only
    the first.  They partition on the row's account (``=`` against ``<>``),

    :func:`app.services.reconcile_service._purchases._outstanding_scope` is

    :attr:`Statement.offerable_period_ids` -- the calendar's OWN saved ids -- so
    a row it returns names a period the calendar was built from and
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.require_period` has nothing to
    refuse.  ``require_period`` stays anyway, as the raising twin a caller
    holding a stored ``pay_period_id`` is supposed to use: it now documents an
    invariant nothing can violate instead of guarding a state something could.

    **A first cut of this leaf scoped on ``pay_periods.user_id`` and argued the
    refusal was unreachable; the argument was measured FALSE** (adversarial
    design review, 2026-08-28), which is why the scope moved rather than the
    prose.  It said an appended payday could hold no rows because the doors that
    record one no longer generate into it -- true of the DOOR and false of the
    REQUEST: ``/grid`` and ``/dashboard`` append and then populate inside one
    ``write_transaction`` (``routes/_period_population.py``, ruling **R-R38**),
    so a concurrent render on a lapsed schedule creates exactly the rows the
    argument said could not exist.  Both of this package's COMMAND doors then
    render after committing -- the reconcile POST, and the true-up PATCH through
    ``prompt_fragment`` -- which is balance finding **N-358**'s shape on two
    money screens.  The query-carried scope closes it here without waiting for
    ``balance:X-i5``, and follows the rule ``require_period``'s own docstring
    states: *where the precondition is carried by the QUERY, the total form is
    honest; where it rests on two reads agreeing, it is not.*

    **A transfer's leg is dated by its TRANSFER** (leaf
    ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-2``): a leg carries no period or due date of its own,
    and both are the parent's, so the transfer arm hands this the transfer --
    whose ``pay_period_id``, ``due_date``, ``id`` and ``__table__`` are what
    this reads -- and the transfer loader's own clause on
    :attr:`Statement.offerable_period_ids` makes the refusal just as
    unconstructible there.  The shadow it handed before carried the same period
    and due date by Transfer Invariant 3.

    Args:
        statement: The statement being reconciled, carrying the owner's
            calendar.
        txn: The row -- a plan row, or a leg's transfer -- whose

            on.

    Returns:
        Its clamped attribution date.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: *txn* names a pay period the statement's calendar does

    implementation of one rule -- and since plan step C4-a-2 the span it clamps
    against is not in the row's own table to join to.

    The offer set is the OVERDUE set: ruling **R-G** clamps a projected row's

    **The second half of "a statement of this day could settle this row", and
    it is about the row's VALUE rather than its landing day.**  An envelope
    settles at ``sum(purchases)`` over EVERY purchase it holds -- that IS its
    ``purchases``-basis settlement record, answered on read by
    ``row_valuation.settled_figure`` (plan step X-au-c3), where it used to be a
    figure a deleted hook wrote into ``actual_amount`` and re-derived after any
    later mutation.  So a row still holding a purchase made AFTER the statement
    day would book that purchase too -- dated on the statement's day, at a
    figure the panel offers with no correction box because an entries-derived
    row is not correctable (ruling **R-FF**).

    **This is the bound the purchase arm has always had, applied to the
    aggregate.**  ``_purchases._outstanding_scope`` refuses an entry with
    ``purchased_on > observed_on`` and says why: a statement cannot show a
    purchase made after the day it covers.  Without this the two arms disagree
    about the same dollars -- the sibling arm refuses a purchase and this one
    re-admits it inside its parent's total.

    **Measured, because it is a money defect and not a tidiness one.**  On a
    clone of production, planting one `$137.45` purchase three days after
    Checking's 2026-08-06 assertion made the panel offer *Close Groceries* at
    `$622.55` instead of `$485.10`; ticking it booked `$622.55` stamped
    2026-08-06, which that day's assertion then absorbs into its own correction
    -- so the purchase contributed nothing forward and the projected balance
    rose by exactly `$137.45` at +30d, +90d and +365d.  (The measurement was
    taken while the absorbing rule was ``ReconciledThrough.covers``; plan step
    X-f3a-1 made it ``StatementCoverage``, which answers the same for an
    unlinked row and so leaves the figure standing.)  That
    is already-spent money handed back to the projection, which is the class of
    defect this arc exists to remove.

    A row with no purchases answers True over an empty sequence, so a bill and
    a deposit are unaffected: they carry a single amount, and
    :func:`lands_on_or_before` is the whole bound for them.  The one entry a
    bill or a paycheck does hold since plan step ``balance:X-bi-3c`` is the
    status seam's covering movement, written when the row SETTLES and, since
    plan step ``balance:X-bi-3e-2``, KEPT un-dated when it leaves the band --
    so a row this OUTSTANDING scope offers may carry one, dated on the day of a
    close the owner has since withdrawn.  That is why the bound is over
    :attr:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction.purchases` and not the family
    (ruling **R-BAL68**): a reverted row's withdrawn close postdating the
    statement is no reason to hold the row back.

    **The transfer arm does not ask it, because its answer there is a
    constant**: a transfer's leg is not purchase-tracked
    (``transfer_legs.TransferLeg.tracks_purchases`` is ``False``, as a shadow's
    was -- ``entry_service.create_entry`` refuses a parent that is not, and
    production held 342 shadows and 0 entries on 2026-09-15), so it holds no
    purchase to postdate the statement and the bound is True for every leg.
    Until leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-2`` both arms shared one loader and it was
    asked of a shadow for exactly that answer.

    **It takes the STATEMENT rather than a bare day**, which is the shape all
    three per-row predicates here share since plan step C4-a-2.  Two of them
    need the calendar the statement carries; leaving the third on a loose
    ``observed_on`` would be one predicate of three a caller can hand a
    different day from the one the other two were measured against.

    the property the purchase arm gets by sharing a clause list, expressed as a

    per-row service verb, not a bulk ``UPDATE``).  Each scope reaches it
    through its :attr:`Arm.load` with its own *scope_clauses* -- the rows on

    loader (the module docstring).

    Two eager loads are ALWAYS applied.  ``entries`` feeds

    the paragraph below is why it is still here.  **Its reason changed at
    pay-calendar plan step C4-a-2 and the load did not**, so the reason is
    written out rather than left to be reconstructed from the load's presence:
    it fed the attribution clamp until then; :func:`attributed_on` now reads
    the span off the statement's calendar and the row's ``pay_period_id``
    column, so the READER touches no relationship at all.

    **The one consumer it was KEPT for is GONE, and the option is not**

    ``transaction_service._settle.settle_from_entries`` logging
    ``txn.pay_period.user_id`` -- and that line reads ``txn.user_id`` now, so
    no code this loader feeds names the relationship any more.  Three reads in
    ``loan_posting_service._payments`` moved the same way in the same step.

    **What has NOT been established is whether anything else on the write
    half reaches it**, and that is exactly the claim an adversarial code review
    narrowed here on 2026-08-28 -- so this step declines to widen it back by
    deleting the option on a census it did not take.  The predicate the next
    reader owes, rather than a count: an attribute read of ``pay_period`` on a
    row :func:`outstanding_rows` RETURNED, reachable from the arm's write
    half, which is a grep for an attribute read of ``pay_period`` across
    ``app/`` with the docstring mentions struck out and each survivor traced
    to the query that produced its row.  ``loan_loaders`` has three, and
    whether a row from THIS scope can reach them is the open half (the
    transfer arm, whose shadows were the likeliest route there, no longer
    loads through here).  Removing the option is a MEASUREMENT -- a lazy load
    here lands an AUTOFLUSH in the middle of a settle that has already mutated
    the row -- and it belongs to whoever takes that census, not to the step

        transaction_ids: The writer's narrowing -- the ids a form submitted.
            ``None`` (the reader) means "everything in scope".  An id outside

    rule: the arm's own settle runs, what it says about a human's figure is
    counted, and the totals are logged once.

    **Recording WHICH statement showed the item is the ARM's** (ruling
    **R-FL**), and that is not a preference: for the transfer arm the money
    still lands on a SHADOW row through the interval, and ``CLAUDE.md``'s
    transfer invariant 4 says no code path mutates one directly.  A write here
    would be the first exception to a rule the project treats as critical, so
    the transfer arm goes through ``transfer_service.record_leg_clearing`` and
    the transaction arm writes its own row through the status seam.

    **It is one function because the two writers HAD BECOME one**, and the gate
    is what said so rather than a preference.  X-f2-c2 left the loop per-arm on
    the argument that it was six lines of glue; X-f2-c3 wrote the second and
    pylint's cross-file ``duplicate-code`` check reported the pair, twice --
    first the telemetry tails, then the whole body once the tails were shared.
    Finding **N-225** predicted this shape in its own words, *(extra scope
    clause, settle callable, OfferKind)*, and was right where the leaf's first
    reading of it was not.

    **The ids are re-derived through the arm's own loader rather than
    trusted.**  An id belonging to another user, outside the arm's scope (on
    another account, for the scopes that offer this account's own rows), a
    settled item or one this arm does not own simply does not come back from
    :attr:`Arm.load` and is silently skipped -- the set-operation form of the
    project's "404 for both not-found and not-yours" rule.  **Each arm is
    handed its OWN TABLE's form field** since leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-2``
    (ruling **R-BAL145**): a row's tick posts ``transaction_ids`` and a
    transfer's ``transfer_ids``, because a transfer id can equal a row id --
    one number naming two tables is what one field could not carry.  Until
    then both arms took the one ``transaction_ids`` set and their
    complementary scopes kept an id from settling twice; the two fields keep it
    so by construction.  **The transaction arm's two scopes share the ROW
    field** (ruling **R-CC116**, plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4b``), because
    there the number names one table in both: they partition on the row's
    account, so an id loads in at most one, and a row the first settles has
    left every settle scope (they admit only Projected rows) before the
    second loads.

    **The count is the VERB's answer, not the column's** (finding **N-231**).
    Reading ``actual_amount`` before and after counted every envelope close as
    a hand-typed correction, because that settle always writes the column --
    measured on a probe of one envelope with nothing submitted, which logged
    ``corrected_count: 1``.  Ruling **R-FB**'s production figure ("11 of 93
    settled bills carry a hand-typed correction") is made of this same signal,

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Pay Period Lock Classifier

**The one place that decides whether a pay period may be deleted or
rebuilt**, and nothing here deletes or rebuilds anything.  Truncate and
regenerate consult it before touching a row; the settings UI renders its
result as a per-period lock badge.  Flask-isolated: takes and returns plain
data, never imports ``request`` / ``session``, and issues no write of any
kind.

**It also WORDS a lock that holds money, since plan step
``pay_calendar:C22``** (ruling **R-PC116**): :func:`movements_held_in` names
every payment and purchase a paycheck holds, read through the same queries
the classifier locks by, and :func:`locked_refusal` is truncate and
regenerate's sentence over them -- beside the reader so the lock and the
words cannot disagree, and here rather than in ``pay_period_gates`` because
that module sits at pylint's 1,000-line ceiling and imports this one.

**It lived inside ``pay_period_admin`` until plan step C3-a** (developer
ruling, 2026-08-10), which is where its own docstring called it "the module's
foundation" while that module's other job was the four destructive writers
built ON the foundation.  Two concerns, and the seam is sharp: everything here
answers a read-only question about a period's state, everything there acts on
the answer.  The line count is what reported it -- ``pay_period_admin`` reached
pylint's 1000-line ceiling -- but the ceiling was the symptom.

The precedence lives in :func:`_resolve_lock`, which
:func:`classify_schedule_locks` is the only caller of.  *That paragraph said
the precedence was "shared by the single-period and bulk classifiers, so the two
query strategies (scalar EXISTS vs. set membership) cannot disagree" until plan
step C2-f3b re-read it: there had been ONE query strategy since the
single-period door became a delegating wrapper (``0c7bb2a``), so the property it
claimed had no subject, and that door -- which no module under ``app/`` had
called since -- is DELETED.*

**It classifies a whole PAY CALENDAR since plan step C2-f3b**, not a list of
ORM rows.  Two things moved with that, and the second is what the first is for.

**The HISTORICAL test reads the DERIVED end.**  It compared
``budget.pay_periods.end_date`` -- a stored copy of ``lead(start_date) - 1``
that plan step **C4-c** dropped and that nothing reconciles against the paydays it
derives from.  A period this classifier calls historical is HARD-LOCKED, so a
stale column was a paycheck the app either protected or offered to delete for
the wrong reason.  Reading it off the derivation means the lock decision and
every other "which paycheck" answer in the application come from one rule, and
that this module survives C4 untouched.

**And the DOOR takes the calendar rather than a period set, which is what makes
a wrong input unconstructible.**  A first cut of this step took an iterable of
:class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` and REFUSED one carrying no
``period_id`` -- a projection past the owner's horizon, which would key every
such period in a call under the same ``None``.  That refusal was a fence, and
all three ``app/`` callers were passing exactly one value:
:meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.saved`.  **An argument a caller
can get wrong is a defect rather than a contract** -- the sentence
:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar._views.saved_window` already makes one layer
down -- so the argument is gone and the door reads the window itself.  There is
nothing left to refuse (adversarial design review, 2026-08-19).

**``as_of`` is REQUIRED, which is a rule about clocks rather than about
defaults.**  It defaulted to ``date.today()``, so ``regenerate_pay_periods``
read the wall clock THREE times for one decision -- benign only because a
period cannot become historical between two statements of one transaction, an
argument that holds by timing rather than by construction.  A caller now
resolves the owner's civil day ONCE and hands it down.  The value every
``app/`` caller supplies is :func:`app.utils.dates.display_today`, ruled
2026-08-19 by the developer: this decides something against the OWNER's
calendar, and the process clock is the container's (finding **balance:N-191**,
which named this function as one of the two sites that needed the ruling).

    A non-``None`` reason is a HARD lock: the period either is historical
    or holds irreplaceable state (settled money, posted ledger entries), and
    no operation may delete or rebuild it --
    not even with ``confirm_discard``.  **An account's balance ASSERTION is no
    longer among them, and it did not become deletable**: ruling R-EO moved the
    assertion off the pay period entirely, so a schedule operation cannot reach
    it at all (see :func:`_resolve_lock`).  ``None`` means the
    period is the mutable payload truncate / regenerate may rewrite; its
    projected and ad-hoc rows are guarded separately by the overridable
    discard gate.

    The members are ordered by precedence.  The classifier returns the
    FIRST applicable reason, so a historical period that also holds a
    settled transaction reports ``HISTORICAL``.

    **``HOLDS_MOVEMENT`` joined at plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``**
    (rulings **R-CC54**: "truncate/regenerate lock its period", and
    **R-CC66**'s badge): a period holding a row or a transfer -- any status,
    soft-deleted or not -- that holds a payment or a purchase, dated or not.
    A movement is money that moved, so an item holding one is history, and
    deleting the period deleted it through the ``pay_period_id`` cascades;
    the movement's key refuses that now, and this makes the refusal a
    designed one.  It outranks ``LEDGER_POSTINGS`` because it is
    the truer sentence where both hold: a dated purchase's own legs are
    what make a period's ledger non-zero.

    **A TRANSFER answers ``SETTLED_TXN`` and ``HOLDS_MOVEMENT`` for itself
    since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4a-3``** (rulings **R-BAL125**,
    **R-BAL157**): by its own status, and by the one ``transfer_legs``

    classifier this once also served is gone).

    **``ACCOUNT_ANCHOR`` left this set at plan step X-f1c3c** (ruling R-EO),
    and it left by becoming unreachable rather than by being relaxed.  It
    refused a period an account's ``current_anchor_period_id`` pointed at; that
    column is deleted, and a balance ASSERTION no longer references a pay
    period either, so no period delete can take one.  What is still worth
    protecting is the period's POSTED state, and ``LEDGER_POSTINGS`` -- which
    outranked ``ACCOUNT_ANCHOR`` anyway -- covers it: measured on the
    developer's production data, all 10 periods holding an assertion carry an
    unbalanced ledger account, so the deleted reason was refusing nothing that
    survives without it.

    **``RECURRENCE_ANCHOR`` left the same way at plan step R7b-4.**  It
    refused a period some recurrence rule's ``start_period_id`` pointed at,
    and the hazard was real while it stood: that FK is ``ON DELETE SET NULL``,
    so deleting the period silently erased the rule's opening bound.  R7b-4
    folded the FK into ``recurrence_rules.start_date`` -- a DATE, which no
    schedule operation can cascade -- so a rule's opening bound now survives
    the deletion of any period.  The lock was protecting a bound that can no
    longer be lost, which makes it unreachable rather than relaxed.

    **An item is what the owner sees in a pay period**: a plan row, or a
    TRANSFER once for its two legs.  A shadow row is never one -- it is its
    transfer's -- so the row query excludes them (``transfer_id IS NULL``,
    the discard gate's idiom) and the transfer query asks the transfer.
    Each query yields one ``(pay_period_id,)`` per item, so a caller reads
    the set of periods (:func:`_period_ids_of`) or counts the items
    (``Query.count``); one that needs more of each item swaps the columns
    with ``with_entities``, keeping the scope.

    **One premise the DOORS hold and no key does** (the reason
    :func:`settled_items` gives for status drift, for the period a shadow
    mirrors; the account a shadow mirrors is
    ``archive_helpers.account_holding_movements``' premise).  A shadow's
    ``pay_period_id`` is its transfer's (Transfer Invariant 3:
    ``transfer_service`` moves both together, a restore re-aligns them,
    carry-forward's bulk moves exclude shadows), so the row query's
    ``transfer_id IS NULL`` drops nothing the transfer query does not ask.
    On the PERIOD drift no door writes -- a shadow filed in period B while
    its transfer is in period A -- each read misses one of the two: the
    shadow read locked B and missed A, whose delete takes the transfer and
    its shadows by cascade; this one locks A and misses B.  Deleting the
    missed period then, at worst, meets

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Loan Payment Service

Queries shadow income transactions on debt accounts and converts them
to PaymentRecord instances for the amortization engine.

Shadow income transactions represent payments received by a debt
account via transfers.  When a user transfers money from checking to
a mortgage account, the transfer service creates two shadow
transactions: an expense on checking (money out) and an income on
the mortgage (money in).  This service queries the income side to
discover all payments into a loan account.

This service queries ONLY budget.transactions (transfer invariant #5).
It NEVER queries budget.transfers.  The balance calculator and all
related services must never depend on the transfers table directly.

    """Query shadow income transactions on a debt account.

    Returns PaymentRecord instances for all non-deleted, non-excluded
    shadow income transactions linked to the given account and scenario.
    Shadow income transactions represent payments received by a debt
    account via transfers.

    Filtering logic:
      - transfer_id IS NOT NULL (shadow transactions only)
      - transaction_type_id = Income (income side of the transfer)
      - is_deleted = False (excludes soft-deleted transactions)
      - status.excludes_from_balance = False (excludes Cancelled and
        Credit statuses, which do not represent actual payments)

    The is_confirmed flag is determined by the status.is_settled
    boolean:
      - True for Paid, Received, Settled (payment actually occurred)
      - False for Projected (payment is committed but not yet made)

    Uses effective_amount (not manual actual/estimated logic) to
    respect the 5A.1 fix: actual_amount when populated, else
    estimated_amount, with correct zero-vs-null handling.

    Args:
        account_id: The debt account receiving payments.
        scenario_id: The active budget scenario.

    Returns:
        List of PaymentRecord instances sorted by payment date
        (ascending).  Empty list if no qualifying transactions exist.

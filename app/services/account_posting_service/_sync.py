"""Account anchor-posting orchestration: per-scenario sync, all-scenarios, per-user.

The entry points that drive a non-loan account's anchor reconcile -- one walk
(:func:`._walk.walk_account_ledger`) feeding one reconcile
(:func:`._anchors.reconcile_account_anchor_corrections`) per (account,
scenario):

* :func:`sync_account_anchor_postings` -- one scenario.
* :func:`sync_account_anchor_postings_all_scenarios` -- the owner's baseline
  scenario PLUS every scenario holding an entry that posts on the account's
  linked ledger.  Anchor history lives on the ACCOUNT, not a scenario, so an
  account-global event (create, true-up, direct anchor edit) re-bases the
  corrections in every scenario at once -- the cash analogue of the loan
  rule; R8 owns the residual multi-scenario policy.
* :func:`resync_user_account_anchor_postings` -- every non-loan account one
  user owns, for the single-user chokepoints (the pay-period reset, whose
  CASCade disposed the user's correction entries with the wiped periods, and
  the ``create_baseline`` recovery path, so openings are not silently
  stranded for a user who lacked a baseline at account-create time).
* :func:`backfill_all_account_anchor_postings` -- the one-time, deploy-wide
  historical sweep over every non-loan account across all owners (C7),
  reusing the identical go-forward sync so backfill == go-forward by
  construction.
* :func:`self_heal_anchor_corrections` -- the effect-time self-heal the
  tails of ``posting_service.sync_transfer_postings`` /
  ``sync_transaction_postings`` invoke after emitting source delta entries:
  a source whose posted effect changed at-or-before an account's latest
  anchor assertion moved that anchor's walked ``ledger_before``, so the
  stale correction is re-derived in the same transaction.

An amortizing loan is a documented NO-OP at every entry point (never an
error: the chokepoints legitimately iterate all of a user's accounts): loans
book their anchor corrections through
:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service` onto their per-loan
``equity_opening`` account, and the two correction families must stay
disjoint or a loan's balance would double-book.  The per-user enumerator
excludes loans structurally (``has_amortization IS FALSE`` -- exactly the
column ``classify_account`` branches on).

Idempotent and self-healing via reconcile-to-target.  Flushes but never
commits -- the caller owns the transaction boundary.

    ``sync_transaction_postings`` (which
    ``reverse_postings_before_delete`` routes through) call this after
    emitting source delta entries.

    **What it decides is whether the reconcile can be SKIPPED, and that is
    the honest way round.**  :func:`sync_account_anchor_postings` is
    idempotent and reconciles to target, so running it after every emission
    is always correct and only ever costs a walk; everything below is the
    proof that a particular walk would write nothing.  Stating it as a skip
    rather than as a fire is not a style choice -- a fire-predicate that
    misses a case silently leaves the ledger wrong, which is exactly what
    happened while this function tested only the first of the two conditions
    below (see the second one).

    A walk writes nothing when BOTH hold:

    1. **The change rides on top of every assertion.**  A source change
       attributed at-or-before an account's latest anchor assertion moves
       that anchor's walked ``ledger_before``, so its posted correction is
       stale until re-derived; a change attributed after every assertion
       adds to the ledger without moving any correction.  The test asks the
       account's own boundary
       (:meth:`app.services.cash_ledger.ReconciledThrough.covers`) about the
       earliest emitted ``entry_date`` -- the SAME rule both walks apply to a
       source, called rather than re-spelled, so a cost guard cannot come to
       disagree with the money rule it is a guard for (finding N-133 / F4; see
       :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.reconciled_through` for the
       timezone-sign bug the third form carried).  A settle-side entry is
       dated at the source's CURRENT
       attribution civil date, and a reversal entry inherits the latest date
       it reverses (the R2 rule) -- the OLD attribution's civil date -- so
       both sides of every lifecycle delta are covered, including the revert
       of an early-settled future-period source whose CURRENT attribution
       (its period start) sits after the anchor while the reversed effect
       preceded it.  Testing ``<=`` rather than ``<`` over-fires for a
       same-day change, where the resync is an idempotent no-op walk -- the
       safe direction, since this is a SKIP predicate.
    2. **The corrections are already POSTED in this scenario.**  "Riding on
       top" says a posted correction does not MOVE; it says nothing about
       one that was never written.  A scenario becomes live for an account
       the moment an entry first lands on its linked ledger there, and the
       account-global sync
       (:func:`sync_account_anchor_postings_all_scenarios`) only visits
       scenarios that were ALREADY live -- so without this arm the very
       emission that makes a scenario live is the one that skips minting its
       opening, and the account's ledger in that scenario reads its activity
       alone.  Worked: a $1,000.00 account opened in January, a fresh
       scenario, one $70.00 expense settled in March -> that scenario's
       linked ledger summed to ``-$70.00`` instead of ``$930.00``, and the
       trial balance closed only because the missing opening and its equity
       twin were both absent.  Latent rather than live today: production
       creates baseline scenarios ONLY (``auth_service`` at registration,
       ``baseline_service`` at recovery), and the baseline always has its
       corrections from account-create time -- so this cannot fire until a
       scenario-clone / what-if feature ships, which is precisely when it
       would have shipped wrong.

    The two are ordered cheapest-first and short-circuit: the common settle
    (dated after the anchor, in a scenario that already carries its
    corrections) pays one indexed EXISTS and no walk.

    An account with no anchor history never fires; an amortizing loan

    **The one transaction in the app that reconciles more than one OWNER**, so
    it is also the only one that takes more than one per-user write lock -- and
    it takes them all up front, ascending by user id
    (:func:`app.services.user_write_lock.lock_every_user_writes`), before the
    first account is visited.  The loop below walks accounts ascending by
    ACCOUNT id, which visits owners in no particular order, so two concurrent
    sweeps could otherwise take the same two keys in opposite orders and
    deadlock.  Pre-taking them makes the acquisition order a property of this
    function rather than of the account table's contents.

    Returns:
        The non-loan account ids reconciled, ascending -- for the deploy log and
        test introspection (empty on an account-free database).

    """Reconcile every non-loan account a SINGLE user owns, across scenarios.

    The per-user chokepoint, mirroring
    ``loan_posting_service.resync_user_loan_postings``: iterates the user's
    non-loan accounts (:func:`_non_loan_account_ids_for_user`) and reconciles
    each through :func:`_reconcile_account_ids` -- the identical go-forward
    sync the deploy backfill uses, so a re-synced correction is identical to a
    go-forward one by construction.

    Two callers need it: ``pay_period_admin.reset_pay_periods`` (the wipe
    CASCADE-disposed the user's correction entries with their periods, so this
    re-derives the corrections onto the rebuilt schedule) and
    ``routes.grid.create_baseline`` (the recovery path for baseline-less
    users, so openings skipped at account-create time are not silently
    stranded).  Scoped to one user because both are single-user operations.

    **The reset half no longer fabricates anything to re-derive FROM**, and
    that is ruling R-EO (plan step X-f1c3c).  It used to run a
    ``_reanchor_accounts`` pass that staged one fresh history row per account,
    because an assertion's ``pay_period_id`` was an ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` FK
    and the wipe took the real assertions with the periods -- measured on
    production, a reset destroyed 69 balance observations and wrote 9
    fabricated replacements.  The assertion carries no period now, so the wipe
    cannot reach it, and this function re-derives the corrections from the
    observations that were always there.

    Idempotent and self-healing via reconcile-to-target.  Flushes but does
    NOT commit -- the caller owns the transaction boundary.

    Args:
        user_id: The owning user whose non-loan accounts to reconcile.

    Returns:
        The non-loan account ids reconciled, ascending (empty when the user
        has none).

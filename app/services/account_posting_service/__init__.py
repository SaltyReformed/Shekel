Shekel Budget App -- Account Posting Service (Build-Order Step 5)

Posts every NON-loan account's anchor assertions into the append-only
double-entry ledger as balanced OPENING / TRUE-UP corrections, mirroring the
shipped loan genesis pattern (:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service`).
After Step 5, every linked ledger sums to an ABSOLUTE balance and the trial
balance closes app-wide::

    confirmed balance = latest anchor assertion
                        + settled facts recorded after that assertion moment

An anchor assertion is a FACT; modeled growth / appreciation / interest
between assertions is a derivation and is never posted (Option D's
fact-versus-derivation line).  A true-up whose delta is $0 means the app
tracked reality perfectly; a non-zero delta is made visible as an explicit
correction whose COUNTER leg names what the difference was -- interest income,
a change in value, or the equity opening (ruling **R-FO**, plan step X-f3d).

## Package layout

Mirrors :mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service` (split by concern):

* :mod:`._walk` -- the pure DAY-granular walk: replay the account's
  :class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory` rows against the source
  facts read back from its linked ledger, producing one
  :class:`AccountAnchorCorrection` per assertion.
* :mod:`._anchors` -- the opening + true-up reconcile: per-(source kind,
  pay period, civil date) targets, posted-leg read-back, one balanced delta
  per key that differs.
* :mod:`._sync` -- the entry points: per-scenario, all-scenarios (baseline
  UNION scenarios with postings on the linked ledger), and per-user.

## Shared infrastructure and isolation

Books through :mod:`app.services.posting_service`'s shared balanced-write
path and the reconcile primitives in
:mod:`app.services._posting_reconcile` (``posted_correction_legs`` /
``emit_correction_deltas``, which owns the union-the-keys loop and the
``delta_legs`` / ``emit_anchor_correction_entry`` pair inside it -- all shared
with the loan package, so the two correction families can never drift on the
delta math, the correction-entry shape, or the reconcile loop itself).  Ledger
rows are minted only via
:func:`app.services.ledger_account_service.get_or_create_account_counter_account`,
whose non-loan guard keeps the loan and account correction families on
disjoint charts, and WHICH counter row a correction books into is ruling
**R-FO**'s total dispatch over the account's projection kind
(:func:`app.services.ledger_account_service.anchor_correction_counter_kind`).
Flask-isolated: plain data in, plain values out; flushes but never commits
(the caller owns the transaction boundary).

**Write status.**  WIRED as of C6, at seven lifecycle chokepoints: account
create (``account_service.create_account``), the anchor true-up
(``anchor_service.apply_anchor_true_up``), the account-type change
(``routes.accounts.crud.update_account`` -- which was the *direct anchor edit*
until plan step X-f1e deleted that door, and now reaches this package only when
a re-type crosses a posting boundary), the pay-period reset
(``pay_period_admin.reset_pay_periods``), the effect-time self-heal at the
``posting_service`` sync tails (:func:`self_heal_anchor_corrections`), the
``create_baseline`` recovery path, and the account-type boundary changes
(the crud/type routes re-sync an allowed crossing; the validation guards
refuse one on a posted account).  C7 adds the deploy-wide historical
backfill (:func:`backfill_all_account_anchor_postings`), reusing the
identical go-forward sync so a backfilled correction is identical to a
go-forward one.

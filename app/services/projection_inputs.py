"""
Shekel Budget App -- Shared Investment-Projection Inputs (F-22 / Commit 18).

Single home for the deduction-loader query and the
:func:`calculate_investment_inputs` kwargs splat that were duplicated
across the investment / retirement / savings / year-end consumers
pre-Commit-18.  The duplicates triggered pylint R0801 (similar-lines)
and -- more importantly -- meant the engine-input contract was defined
in four places at once, any one of which could drift independently.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``: "services are isolated from Flask"):
this module imports no Flask symbol.  All inputs are plain data (user
id, account id, ORM model instances already loaded by the caller); the
return values are ORM lists, plain dicts, and the existing
:class:`~app.services.investment_projection.InvestmentInputs` DTO.

The deductions-loader and the projection-inputs wrapper live here
rather than in :mod:`app.services.investment_projection` because that
module's module-level docstring promises "no database access" -- the
contract Commit 28 / S6-01 set up so pure-data tests can construct
FakeDeduction / FakeContribution objects without a DB.  Placing the
DB-touching helpers in a sibling module preserves that boundary.

**That boundary is why :func:`load_payroll_feeds` is here** (plan step
**salary:R14-b**).  Pricing an account's payroll feed means running the
paycheck engine, which means resolving a profile and its tax configs, which
means a session -- so the PRICING happens at this loader and the pure module
receives a finished
:class:`~app.services.investment_projection.AccountPayrollFeed`.  It is the
same split ``PricedContribution`` and ``ShadowContributions`` already sit on,
applied to the third and last input that was still arriving raw.

    not issue ``IN ()`` queries against PostgreSQL.

    **This is the BOUNDARY where a contribution is valued** (plan step
    X-au-c2, a developer ruling of 2026-08-12).  It used to return ORM rows and
    four readers in :mod:`app.services.investment_projection` each asked them
    for ``effective_amount`` behind its own copy of the
    ``status_contributes_to_balance`` screen.  That property cannot answer for
    a row whose amount is DERIVED -- such a row stores no figure -- and a module
    whose docstring promises no database access can never resolve one.  So the
    resolution happens HERE, where the session is: ONE
    :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id` call over the whole
    cross-account row set, which is also one paycheck-engine run rather than
    one per account (finding **N-228**, and what re-keying the basis on the
    OWNER rather than an ``Account`` bought).

    **It is also where a contribution is DATED, since plan step C2-f2c**, and
    that is the same argument applied to the same record's other derived fact.
    Every reader downstream buckets contributions by pay period and then needs
    that period's PAYDAY -- the YTD windows to compare it against the current
    period's, the timeline to stamp it on a
    :class:`~app.services.growth_engine.ContributionRecord`.  Carrying the id
    alone made each of them take the owner's whole period list as a lookup
    table, so three public signatures held a join this query can do in one
    ``JOIN``.  ``PayPeriod.start_date`` is the paydays' own column and the one
    plan step **C4** keeps, so this reads a fact rather than a derivation; the
    join is INNER, which drops nothing, because the filter below already
    excludes a ``NULL`` ``pay_period_id``.

    **Rows that contribute nothing are DROPPED rather than priced at zero.**
    :func:`~app.services.investment_projection._inputs._average_transfer_contribution`
    divides by the number of distinct pay periods it sees, so a Cancelled
    contribution carried through as ``$0.00`` would enlarge that denominator and
    silently lower the average.  The screen is applied before the pricing for
    the same reason the valuation gates before it resolves: an excluded row has
    no derived answer to give.

    The ``eager_status`` switch is gone with them.  It defaulted to ``False``
    while every consumer needed the status, so the retirement chain lazy-loaded
    it per row; the status is now read exactly once here, under a ``joinedload``
    that is no longer optional.

    Args:
        basis: The read pass's
            :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis` -- the owner and the
            scenario these amounts resolve under, and the derivations they
            resolve through.  Taken rather than built here since plan step
            X-au-c2b, so a caller that also prices its own rows pays for the
            paycheck engine once (findings **N-268**, **N-269**).

        the ``linked_account_ids`` of every account that had a contribution
        shadow WHATEVER its status.  The second field is not decoration: an
        adversarial review found that screening the records alone flipped
        ``retirement_projection``'s ``none_linked`` for an account whose
        contributions were all Cancelled, telling the owner to link a
        contribution that already exists.

    :func:`price_payroll_feeds` with the set it believes -- which is what the
    ``/retirement`` batch loader and picture do (salary:S3-f-2b).

    **The producer plan step salary:R14-b puts in place of the feed's own

    both facts the paycheck engine establishes when it prices the paycheck.
    This takes :class:`~app.services.income_service.PaycheckPricing` -- the
    ONE spelling of a profile's projection since ``salary:R14-a`` -- and hands
    each account two RESOLVERS closed over the pricers of the profiles that
    fund it, each folding the
    :class:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.DeductionLine`\\ s of the

    **It prices NOTHING here, since plan step salary:S3-e-2** (ruling
    **R-SAL15**).  It priced the owner's whole saved window up front and
    handed the feed two dictionaries, which is why the feed had to INVENT a
    figure past the last saved payday; a resolver asks the pricer for the
    period it is handed, whichever one that is, and the pricer's memo makes
    the second ask free.  What this function still does up front is build
    the per-profile pricers (:meth:`~app.services.income_service
    .PaycheckPricing.for_profile`), because THAT is where the tax series
    loads -- so the loader keeps every query, and a resolver fired inside
    :mod:`app.services.investment_projection`'s *no database access*
    contract issues none.

    It answers R-SAL2's three questions at their source rather than
    re-deriving any of them:

    * **WHOSE salary** -- each deduction is priced inside its OWN profile's
      paycheck, because that is the profile whose deductions the engine walked.
      A two-job owner's two profiles are two projections, and no reader picks
      between them.
    * **WHICH gross** -- the paycheck's own, raises applied as of its payday.
    * **WHICH clock** -- the period's, never ``date.today()``.  Nothing here
      reads a clock; the CALENDAR is the domain.

    **The profiles are NAMED, never searched**, which is what retires
    ``income_service.get_current_gross_biweekly`` rather than re-pointing it.
    That helper resolved a profile with an unordered ``.first()`` across the
    owner's active profiles -- a measured **39%** swing on a two-job owner,
    flipping between renders -- and answered ``$0.00`` whenever no period
    covered today, which silently deleted the whole contribution plan at
    onboarding and after a horizon lapse.  Here the employee half's profile is
    the one the DEDUCTION belongs to and the employer half's is the one
    ``budget.investment_params.salary_profile_id`` names (**R-SAL5**), so
    there is no search to be non-deterministic about and no clock to answer
    zero against.

    **An unknown funding profile models NO employer money** (developer,
    2026-09-04): the account gets no gross resolver, which is what
    :attr:`~app.services.investment_projection.AccountPayrollFeed.funds_employer`
    reports and what the surfaces render as *the funding job is not set*.
    Unknown covers three states and they are one answer: the column is
    ``NULL``, it names a profile the owner has ARCHIVED (an employer
    contribution from a job they have left is not money they receive), or it
    names a profile that is not theirs -- the forged FK ``salary:R14-a``
    closed at the write door and this scopes against a second time, because a
    read that trusts a column's ownership is a read that can be made to price
    a stranger's salary.

    Args:
        paychecks: The read pass's
            :class:`~app.services.income_service.PaycheckPricing`, which
            carries the owner's calendar as well as their prices.

            **It replaced a calendar beside an OPTIONAL memo at plan step
            salary:S3-d**, and both halves of that pair were holes.  Running
            the engine is the expensive half of a feed -- each paycheck
            replays the year's prior paydays for its FICA and annual-cap
            cumulatives -- and the balance seam asks for a feed once per
            ACCOUNT, so without a memo the engine re-ran the same profile once
            per account per entry.  ``breakdowns=None`` meant "no memo", and
            two of that argument's four callers passed it inside the step that
            added it; there is nothing to omit now.  Taking the calendar off
            the same value is the other half: a calendar handed separately is
            one owner's paydays pairable with another owner's prices.

            **The OWNER comes off it too**, for the same reason and by the
            same argument one input further: this took a ``user_id`` beside
            the calendar, and every caller filled it with the owner that
            calendar already names.  Two homes for one fact on the very
            function whose case against a separate calendar is that pairing
            them is a hazard -- so the ``user_id`` every query below is
            scoped by is read off the pricer (``paychecks.user_id``, pinned
            beside its calendar source and refused at the first derivation if
            the two disagree, plan step salary:C12), which cannot disagree
            with the paydays and costs no derivation to ask.  *The calendar's
            PAYDAYS are not read here any more* (plan step salary:S3-e-2):
            the owner is the only thing this function takes off it.

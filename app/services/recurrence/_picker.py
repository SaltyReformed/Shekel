"""What the recurrence form OFFERS, and what each option is called (R7b-2).

The picker's vocabulary, replacing the closed-set pattern list that
``_vocabulary`` held until plan step R7b-2.  A form no longer chooses a NAME
for a cadence ("Quarterly"); it authors the two axes directly -- how often
(``interval_n`` and ``unit``) and which pay period funds an occurrence
(``placement``) -- and this module is the one producer of which of those
readings may be offered and how each reads to a human.

**The offer set is DERIVED from the producer that would REFUSE the cadence**,
through :func:`~app.services.recurrence._frequency.authorable_cadences`, and
that is the whole point.  While the picker iterated ``RecurrencePatternEnum``
and the write door read a different table, "nothing offers an uncreatable
cadence" held only because the two sets happened to coincide -- a coincidence no
gate protected.  Serving the options from the refusing producer makes that
refusal UNREACHABLE through the form rather than fenced behind it (developer
ruling 2026-08-12).

**What that producer IS moved at plan step R7c-c**, and the offer set widened
with it.  The binding constraint used to be storage: ``budget.recurrence_rules``
named its cadence with a closed pattern set, so ``(2, MONTH)`` walked correctly
and had nowhere to be written.  With ``unit_id`` and ``interval_n`` authored
columns every reading can be stored, and what is left is whether the
application can HONOUR it -- which since plan step R8-a is
:func:`~app.services.recurrence._frequency.authorable_cadences`' two derived
rules, replacing the ``anchor_family`` router that gated it on
first-occurrence derivations ruling **R-R16** had already deleted.  Three
consequences here:

* **the interval is a free number box for every unit.**  ``fixed_intervals``
  and ``free_unit_ids`` are deleted with the ``<select>`` they fed, and
  :class:`CadenceWire` no longer carries an ``interval_n`` at all -- an offer
  names a ``(unit, placement)`` pair and every positive interval is authorable
  on it;
* **a placement stopped being a property of the ``(unit, interval)`` PAIR.**
  ``MONTHLY_FIRST`` had no quarterly twin, so "MONTH allows either placement"
  was true at interval 1 and false at 3 and 6; that dependency was the closed
  set's, and it is gone.  The MONTH unit offers both placements at every
  interval, which is plan ledger row **D32**'s measured defect ceasing to
  exist rather than being warned about;
* **the "Funded from" row is always RENDERED** (developer ruling 2026-08-16,
  the rest of D32).  ONE cadence still admits one placement -- the ``PERIOD``
  unit, where it is inert
  (:func:`~app.services.recurrence._frequency.emits_period_starts`) -- and
  hiding the row for it is what let a funding rule change with nothing on
  screen saying so.  It was TWO until plan step **R8-a**, which admitted the
  ``YEAR`` unit's deferring reading; the row's two help sentences are unchanged
  and only the set each applies to moved.

**A flat list of pairs, not a nested tree**, and the shape is a DRY decision
rather than a convenience.  The form needs two linked answers -- which units,
and which placements for a unit -- and emitting them as a nested structure would
state the grouping rule a second time, in a producer that could drift from the
set it groups.  A consumer filters the pairs instead, which cannot mean anything
the offer set does not.

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock.  The ``ref`` ids come from
:mod:`app.ref_cache`, the project's IDs-for-logic seam.

    Projects a rule's cadence onto the ids the form posts, so the edit form's
    preselection cannot disagree with what the rule actually means.

    **It takes the READING rather than the stored columns, and plan step R7c-b
    is why.**  It used to take ``(pattern_id, interval_n)`` and decode them
    here -- which made the edit form the ONE reader still deriving a rule's
    unit and placement from the closed pattern set, while
    :func:`~app.services.recurrence.recurrence_spec` had moved to the authored
    ``unit_id`` / ``placement_id`` columns.  Two readers of one cadence, in a
    step whose whole claim is that every reader moved across.  The reading
    arrives from :func:`~app.services.recurrence.stored_cadence`, which is
    where "what the row's cadence columns say" is stated once -- and since plan
    step R7c-c that is a straight read of three columns rather than a decode.

    **A ``<select>`` whose selected value is absent from its options does not
    fail -- it silently becomes a different value**, which is why this is
    derived rather than assembled per form.  Measured on the transaction edit
    form before plan step R2e-2: no option carried ``selected``, so the browser
    fell back to the first in document order, which is the empty "Does not
    repeat" entry -- and submitting THAT deletes the rule and sweeps its future
    rows.  The caller asks :func:`~app.services.recurrence.stored_cadence`
    FIRST and renders the controls unset when the answer is ``None``, so this
    function is never asked about a cadence it cannot project.

    Args:
        reading: What the stored rule says on both authored axes, from
            :func:`~app.services.recurrence.stored_cadence`.

    Returns:
        The :class:`SelectedCadence`.

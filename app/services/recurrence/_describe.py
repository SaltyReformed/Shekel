"""
Shekel Budget App -- Describing a recurrence in words (plan step R7a)

What a recurring definition's "Recurrence" cell says, produced ONCE here from
the two-axis meaning rather than eight times in a template.

Why this is not a template's job
--------------------------------

Until plan step R7a the cell was SEVEN hand-written Jinja branches keyed on
``recurrence_rules.pattern_id`` -- one per member of the closed pattern set --
each reading ``day_of_month`` / ``month_of_year`` directly, plus a fallback.
Three problems, all of them structural:

* it read the CLOSED-SET columns, every one of which plan step R7c drops, so
  the surface could not survive the cutover;
* the seven branches were written independently and had drifted into three
  different shapes -- a yearly rule showed month AND day, a quarterly rule
  showed month only, a monthly rule showed day only -- with no reason behind
  the difference beyond who wrote which branch;
* **the vocabulary itself was the ceiling.**  Cadences the closed set had no
  member to name -- ``(2, MONTH)``, which plan step R7c-c made authorable, and
  ``(1, WEEK)``, which is still plan step R8's -- could have no branch written
  for them at all; a rule the
  seven did not match fell to a fallback that titled the ``ref`` row's own
  ``name``.  That fallback was the last ``.name``-for-display coupling on THIS
  table, and the only reader of the eager-joined ``RecurrenceRule.pattern``
  relationship (plan ledger row **D17**).

:func:`describe` is one function over ``(interval_n, unit)`` plus the anchor,
so a cadence nothing has authored yet already reads correctly.  The developer
ruled the uniform shape on 2026-08-08: **every calendar cadence names its cycle
the same way, month and day**, which is what a yearly rule already did and what
quarterly and semi-annual rules did not.

Which month the phrase names, and why it MOVED
----------------------------------------------

A quarterly rule fires in months ``{m, m+3, m+6, m+9}``: naming any one of them
names the whole cycle.  The old cell named the AUTHORED ``month_of_year``; this
one names the anchor's month -- the rule's FIRST occurrence.  Measured on
production 2026-08-08, exactly 2 of the 46 LIVE rules move, both because the
authored month falls before the owner's schedule opens (2026-03-26):

```text
Anchor Disposal  quarterly, authored March, day 2   Mar -> Jun 2
Clothes          6-monthly, authored March, day 15  Mar -> Sep 15
```

Both still name the same cycle, and the moved value is the one the model can
still express after plan step R7c drops ``month_of_year``.

**Five further shapes change wording, and none is live today** -- stating the
measurement rather than the change is a claim-scope error this arc has made
before.  Each is authorable through the form (``day_of_month`` and
``month_of_year`` are optional in ``TemplateCreateSchema`` and the month
``<select>`` carries an empty option), and each new phrase is what the resolver
ALREADY generates rows for -- the old cell simply did not say so, falling
through to the picker's own label:

```text
Monthly, no day        Monthly (specific day)  ->  Monthly (day 1)
Quarterly, no month    Quarterly               ->  Quarterly (Apr 1)
Semi-annual, no month  Every 6 months          ->  Every 6 months (Jul 1)
Annual, no month       Yearly                  ->  Yearly (Jan 1)
Every N periods, N=1   Every 1 paychecks       ->  Every paycheck
```

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.  It takes a
:class:`~app.services.recurrence.ResolvedRecurrence` and returns a value; the
template picks the phrase up and styles it.

class RecurrenceDescription:
    """How one recurring definition repeats, in display terms.

    Attributes:
        cadence: The finished phrase -- ``"Every paycheck"``,
            ``"Monthly (day 22)"``, ``"Quarterly (Apr 21)"``.  Plain text: the
            template styles it and never assembles it, so the shape of the
            phrase is decided in one place for every cadence including the
            ones nothing authors yet.
        stops: When the definition stops, as ONE finished phrase --
            ``"until Mar 01, 2027"``, ``"for 12 occurrences"`` --
            or ``None`` when nothing stops it and the cell shows no second
            line.

            **It answers for EVERYTHING that stops the definition since plan
            step R7d-d, not only for the bound its owner authored.**  A
            recurring transfer into a loan stops when the debt does, and until
            that step the only way that fact reached this phrase was a cached
            copy of the loan's derived payoff written into the authored
            bound's own column by ten call sites -- so the sentence named
            whichever value a chokepoint had most recently written.  It now
            words the whole :class:`~app.services.recurrence.Closing`, which
            is the same value the occurrence walk reads, so the cell cannot
            describe a rule the generator does not follow.

            **It was two fields, ``until`` and ``after_occurrences``, with a
            ``__post_init__`` refusing the pair, until plan step R7b-3.**  That
            guard existed because ``ck_recurrence_rules_single_end_bound``
            refuses the pair in the TABLE and "a value built in memory is not
            the table" -- without it a cell could render "until Mar 01, 2027"
            AND "for 12 occurrences", two stop dates for one commitment.

            Carrying the two fields was itself the defect one layer up, and an
            adversarial review of this step named it: the template then
            branched on ``description.until`` and
            ``description.after_occurrences``, which is three shapes and TWO
            branches, so a fourth shape
            (plan step R8 adds one) would render nothing at all and the cell
            would read as indefinite -- a commitment the app goes on charging.
            :func:`_stops_phrase` is total over the shapes and RAISES for one
            it has no wording for, exactly as :func:`_stem` and
            :func:`_placement_note` do for their own closed sets.

            A phrase rather than a date, so the wording of a stop is decided
            here beside the wording of a cadence.  It also takes the month name
            off ``strftime('%b')``, which the cell used and which delegates to
            the platform and follows ``LC_TIME`` -- the dependence
            :data:`app.utils.dates._MONTH_NAMES_ABBR` is spelled out to escape.
            **That is a HAZARD rather than a measured failure**, and an
            adversarial review of this step corrected an earlier note here for
            claiming otherwise: CPython never calls ``setlocale``, nothing in
            ``app/`` does either, and ``%b`` measured English under
            ``LANG=de_DE.UTF-8`` in this repo's own venv.  What makes the move
            load-bearing is the totality above; the locale is why it was worth

    Three branches.  The date arm discriminates on
    :attr:`~app.services.recurrence.EndBound.end_date`, which every shape
    answers, so no second table of authored kinds is introduced; the other two
    delegate to :func:`_authored_phrase`, which is total over
    :data:`~app.services.recurrence.END_BOUND_KINDS` and FAILS LOUD for a shape
    it cannot word.  Asking it first is what makes that refusal reachable from
    here too.

    * **The owner named a date too** -- both are the same kind of statement, so
      the phrase names the EARLIER of the two.  There is nothing to conjoin:
      whichever comes first is when the definition stops, and saying both would
      state one fact twice.
    * **The owner named no stop at all** -- the derived date is the whole
      answer.  This is the case every live loan payment is in once plan step
      R7d-g NULLs the cached column.
    * **The owner named a stop that is not a date** -- a count, today, and the
      two are INCOMPARABLE without walking the occurrences: "for 12 of them"
      and "until the loan clears" cannot be ordered as values.  Both bind, so
      both are said.  Stating them is exact; picking one would be a guess, and
      the row's own "Next" column already shows which is biting.

    Args:
        derived: The derived stop's closing date.

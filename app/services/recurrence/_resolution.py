"""
Shekel Budget App -- Resolving an authored recurrence into its two-axis view

One pure function, :func:`resolve`, turns what a caller AUTHORS
(:class:`RecurrenceSpec` -- a cadence, a first occurrence and the bounds) into
what the recurrence MEANS (:class:`ResolvedRecurrence` -- an interval, a unit, a
first occurrence, a placement, a shift, the bounds, and the 0-or-1 nominal day).

**Since plan step R7c-b the FIRST OCCURRENCE is authored rather than derived**
(ruling **R-R16**, plan ledger row **D28**).  A caller states ``starts_on``; the
row stores it; this module reads it.  What used to live here was a set of
DERIVATIONS that reconstructed that date on every read from
``(start_date, day_of_month, month_of_year)`` plus the owner's schedule -- an
effective-start maximum, a month-ordinal residue walk, and a scan of the
schedule's own months for ``Monthly First``.  All three are deleted, and with
them three ledger rows:

* **D10** -- ``_first_of_month_anchor``'s fallback was HORIZON-DEPENDENT, so
  extending the schedule could move a ``Monthly First`` rule's first occurrence
  a month earlier.  A stored date does not move.
* **D21** / **D24** -- the ``PERIOD`` unit's cycle phase was read from the
  ``offset_periods`` COLUMN on one path and derived from the rule's start period
  on another.  It is now read off ``starts_on`` on every path, by
  :func:`_derive_offset_periods`, and plan step R7c-c DROPPED the column it
  used to be written to.  The value survives on
  :class:`ResolvedRecurrence` -- ``_occurrence``'s period walk is its one
  reader -- as a derivation rather than a stored fact.

**``starts_on`` has ONE meaning for every unit**, which is the whole content of
the ruling: the first date a calendar cadence fires on, and the payday of the
first paycheck a pay-period cadence bills in.  The asymmetry plan ledger row
**D6** records -- ``anchor_date`` meaning an occurrence for three units and an
opening BOUND for the fourth -- is gone with the field's old name.  A caller
may author any date for a pay-period cadence and :func:`_first_occurrence`
NORMALISES it onto the paycheck that hosts it, so the value this module returns
is a real occurrence by construction rather than by a second function agreeing
with the walk.

**The closed set owns nothing here from plan step R7c-c.**  ``interval_n`` was
the last value this module took through the storage encoding -- the write door
stored ``1`` for every pattern whose interval was baked into its NAME, so a
Quarterly rule's ``3`` was recovered from the pattern and never from the column
-- and migration ``d9f5c1a48b73`` re-points the column and deletes the encode /
decode pair.  What this module reads is what a caller authored.

**Every cadence this resolves NAMES A REAL RHYTHM, and a consumer may rely on
that.**  ``Once`` used to be the exception -- it meant "does not recur", so no
honest cadence existed for it, and it resolved to the same inert value as
"every paycheck" while four separate guards elsewhere did the real suppressing.
Plan step R2e-3 deleted it: "does not recur" is NO RULE naming the definition,
on either template kind, which never reaches this module at all.

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.  Its two inputs are the
authored spec and the owner's
:class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar`, so every derivation below can
be exercised at exact dates.

The two derivations that are left
---------------------------------

1. **The first occurrence** (:func:`_first_occurrence`).  For a calendar
   cadence it IS ``spec.starts_on``: the caller named a date the cadence fires
   on, and nothing about the owner's schedule can move it.  For the ``PERIOD``
   unit the occurrences are PAYDAYS, so an authored date is normalised onto the
   payday of the first paycheck that has not ENDED before it -- which is
   :func:`app.services.recurrence._occurrence._period_walk`'s own first yield,
   restated as a direct search rather than as a second opinion about it.

2. **The cycle phase** (:func:`_derive_offset_periods`).  An
   ``Every N Periods`` rule fires on the paycheck its first occurrence falls in
   and every Nth after, so the phase is that paycheck's own ordinal modulo the
   interval.  Nobody authors it and no template has ever rendered an input for
   it; the column is written from this answer and read by nothing.

``end_date >= starts_on`` is NOT validated here.  It is a two-field comparison
over values the FORM collects, so it belongs to the submission's validator
(``schemas/validation/_helpers``) and to the CHECK of the same name that plan
step R7c-b puts on the table.  This module refuses what a CALLER states that
its own derivations cannot survive, which since that step is one column domain
(:func:`_require_authored_domains`) and two structural pairs
(:func:`~._nominal_day._require_nominal_day_pair`, which moved with the whole
nominal-day leaf to :mod:`._nominal_day` at plan step salary:R15-a, and
:func:`_require_month_ceiling_pair`).

**The bound's own shape needs no validation at all, since plan step R7b-3.**
"At most one closing bound" and "a count names at least one occurrence" are
carried by :class:`~app.services.recurrence.EndBound`, which cannot express
either violation, so this module holds no refusal for them and neither does
anything else.

    """What a recurrence MEANS, on the two axes, against one schedule.

    A computed value, never a row: it is what plan step R3's forward occurrence
    engine consumes and what the display describer words.  Since plan step
    R7c-b the columns behind it are AUTHORED rather than derived, so this value
    is mostly a typed reading of them -- the two things it still computes are
    the pay-period normalisation and the cycle phase, both stated in the module
    docstring.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (11/7) -- the first nine are what
    one recurrence means, read as a flat unit by a single consumer, and the
    plan's END-state table (section 3) carries all but ``offset_periods``; the
    ninth, ``max_per_month``, joined at plan step salary:R15-a as the
    cadence's third value and is read flat for the reason ``interval_n`` and
    ``unit`` are.  The tenth and eleventh,
    ``books_opened_on`` and ``is_envelope`` (rulings **R-PC85**, **R-PC89**),
    are facts about the DEFINITION the read pass attaches as one
    ``balance_at._definition_books.DefinitionBooks`` value and lays here
    flat, each read on its own by the walk -- the floor by the comparison,
    the flag by :meth:`books_day`.  Pairing
    ``starts_on`` with ``nominal_day`` was weighed and rejected: it would make
    every consumer unwrap a two-field object to ask for a date, and since this
    step the pair cannot disagree, so there is nothing for a wrapper to police.
    Mirrors the :class:`RecurrenceSpec` and ``transfer_service.TransferSpec``
    precedents.

    Carries ENUM members rather than ``ref`` table ids because nothing
    persists it.  The ids exist to put a value in a column; a consumer asking
    "is this monthly" should compare
    ``resolved.unit is RecurrenceUnitEnum.MONTH``, not two integers whose
    meaning depends on a seed.

    Attributes:
        offset_periods: The phase within the period cycle -- an
            ``Every N Periods`` rule fires where
            ``(period_index - offset_periods) % interval_n == 0``.  Derived
            here from :attr:`starts_on` so the write door writes it from the
            same call that produced the date, rather than running the
            derivation twice and hoping the two agree.  **Nothing reads the
            COLUMN it is written to** (plan ledger rows **D21** / **D24**);
            plan step R7c-c drops it.
        interval_n: How many *unit*\\ s pass between occurrences.  Always the
            two-axis reading: 3 for Quarterly, 6 for Semi-Annual, the authored
            count for ``Every N Periods``, 1 elsewhere.
        unit: The cadence unit *interval_n* counts.
        starts_on: The rule's FIRST OCCURRENCE, one meaning for every unit
            (ruling **R-R16**): the first date a calendar cadence fires on, and
            the payday of the first paycheck a pay-period cadence bills in.
            Occurrences are this date plus multiples of *interval_n* units, so
            its position in the cycle IS the rule's phase and nothing is
            generated before it.
        placement: How an occurrence DATE maps onto the pay period a row lives
            in.  The axis today's Monthly and Monthly First patterns differ on.
        shift: Weekend / holiday adjustment for the occurrence date.  Always
            ``NONE`` until plan step R8.
        closing: EVERYTHING that stops this definition -- the bound the owner
            authored, and any stop DERIVED from outside the rule, held as one
            value that answers for both (:class:`~app.services.recurrence.
            Closing`, plan step R7d-d).  It was the authored bound alone until
            that step, which is why a loan payment's derived payoff had to be
            CACHED into the authored bound's own column to reach the walk at
            all -- one column holding two facts, ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14's
            stored-and-derived case.

            The authored half is still ONE value with three shapes, so "at
            most one closing bound"
            (``ck_recurrence_rules_single_end_bound``) is a state the type
            cannot express rather than one anything has to check; see
            :mod:`app.services.recurrence._bounds`.  The derived half is a
            separate closed set for the reason that module states -- nothing
            offers, posts or stores it -- and lives in
            :mod:`app.services.recurrence._closing`.

            **:func:`resolve` fills the authored half and leaves the derived
            one empty**, because deciding it means folding a destination's
            balance and this module is pure.  The composed read door
            (``recurring_definition.resolved_definition``) is what attaches it.
            A consumer never has to know which of the two it holds: the walk
            asks :meth:`~app.services.recurrence.Closing.admits` and the
            describer words the whole value.
        nominal_day: The day the rule MEANS when *starts_on*'s own month was
            too short to hold it -- April has no 31st, so a day-31 rule first
            occurring there carries ``starts_on = 2026-04-30`` and
            ``nominal_day = 31``.  ``None`` when the date holds the day itself,
            which is every rule whose day is 1-28 and every rule that does not
            fire on a day of the month at all.  Presence is the discriminator
            (ruling R-R3), and it is what stops a month-end rule from decaying
            to the 30th forever.  **Read it through :attr:`day_of_month`**,
            never directly: the day a rule MEANS is the two fields taken
            together, and open-coding that join is how a second answer starts.
        max_per_month: The most occurrences any one calendar month admits,
            or ``None`` for no ceiling (plan step salary:R15-a, ruling
            **R-SAL29**, amended 2026-09-13): a month's first N paydays on
            the owner's calendar for the paycheck unit, the rule's own first
            N of the month for the week unit.  The occurrence walk drops the
            rest, for every unit; it is refused at construction beside a unit
            whose occurrences cannot repeat within a month, so a value here is
            one the walk can act on.
        books_opened_on: The latest governing ``opened_on`` across every
            account the definition moves money in, or ``None`` for no
            floor (ruling **R-PC85**, plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``).  **The
            opening end's mirror of :attr:`closing`**: the rule says when it
            fires and the ACCOUNT says where the app keeps books, so the walk
            names no occurrence whose row would land on or before this day
            (ruling **R-PC86**: the row's CASH day, :meth:`row_date`, under
            :func:`~app.utils.books_boundary.books_hold`'s strict reading --
            an opening is the CLOSE of its day, ruling R-HG).  Until that step
            nothing stated the bound at all: the owner's first payday stood in
            for it, because an occurrence with no paycheck to land in is
            skipped, and a paycheck recorded below the books let the rule fill
            it -- a Van Payment and a birthday dated before Checking's books,
            measured on a production clone.

            **:func:`resolve` leaves it ``None``**, for the reason it leaves
            the closing's derived half empty: it is pure, and the day is a
            fact about ACCOUNTS read from the database.  ONE composition
            attaches it (``balance_at.resolved_with_books``), with two
            callers: the read pass's memo (``BalanceContext.resolved_for``),
            which every reader of a STORED or unsaved definition's
            occurrences takes it from -- row creation, the forecast's loan
            estimate, the Recurring screens and the form's live preview --
            and the opening restatement's refusal, which asks it of books no
            account has yet (``planned_rows_books``).  **It is not a copy of
            the rule's start
            and must not become one**: an opening is restated (the owner's
            Van Loan moved 05-21 -> 04-22 on the data this was measured on),
            and a stored copy would need a reconciler (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).
        is_envelope: Whether the definition is an ENVELOPE -- a spending
            budget whose row takes purchases, the template's
            ``is_envelope`` -- so the walk compares its paycheck's LAST day
            with the books rather than its due day (ruling **R-PC89**, plan
            step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``; :meth:`books_day`).  Attached beside
            :attr:`books_opened_on` by the same composition
            (``balance_at.resolved_with_books``) and for the same reason
            :func:`resolve` leaves it ``False``: it is a fact about the
            DEFINITION, not the rule.  A transfer is never one.

    """What a caller AUTHORS about a recurrence.

    **The TWO-AXIS vocabulary since plan step R7b, and ONE DATE since plan step
    R7c-b.**  Three fields left at that step and they were one fact between
    them: ``start_date`` was the opening validity bound, ``day_of_month`` the
    cycle's day and ``month_of_year`` its month.  A recurrence's first
    occurrence carries all three -- it is the earliest thing the cadence
    produces, its day is the cycle's day, and its month is the cycle's residue
    class -- so ``starts_on`` is the whole of it and the other three are gone
    (ruling **R-R16**, plan ledger row **D28**).  What made that ruling
    necessary is that a BOUND cannot carry a month residue: measured on a
    production clone, 18 of the 24 live multi-month rules would have fired in
    the wrong months forever under the reading it replaced.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (8/7) -- these are the irreducible
    inputs of one authoring request, exactly the fields the recurrence form
    collects, read as a flat unit by the single consumer (:func:`resolve`);
    the eighth, ``max_per_month``, is the cadence's third value since plan
    step salary:R15-a (a ninth, ``due_day_of_month``, left at plan step
    recurrence:R5-a, ruling **R-R96**).  Mirrors the ``TransferSpec`` precedent.  Frozen so a
    constructed spec is an immutable record of one request.

    Attributes:
        user_id: The owning user.
        unit: The cadence unit -- what *interval_n* counts.
        starts_on: The rule's FIRST OCCURRENCE.  Required, and that is a money
            decision rather than a typing one: the create routes generate with
            no lower window bound, so an unbounded opening let a ``$2,000.00``
            rent template created today write five backdated rows into pay
            periods that had already closed.  A caller may state any date for
            a pay-period cadence -- :func:`resolve` NORMALISES it onto the
            paycheck that hosts it, so what is stored is always a real
            occurrence.
        interval_n: How many *unit*\\ s pass between occurrences.  Meaningful
            for EVERY unit since plan step R7b, which is the point: it was
            read only for ``Every N Periods`` while the other three cadences
            baked their interval into a pattern NAME, and that fusion is this
            arc's root cause.
        placement: Which pay period funds an occurrence.  **INERT under the
            ``PERIOD`` unit** -- a pay-period-space rule emits a paycheck's own
            ``start_date`` and both placements carry such a date back to that
            same period (proven in :mod:`._occurrence`) -- so it defaults to
            ``CONTAINING_DATE``, the reading under which the occurrence is
            funded by the paycheck it falls in.
        nominal_day: The day the rule means when *starts_on*'s own month was
            too short to hold it, and ``None`` -- which is every ordinary rule
            -- when the date holds the day.  The form collects it only where
            the chosen date leaves the question open: a date that is its
            month's last day in a month shorter than 31 days could be "the
            28th" or "the last day of the month", and those are different
            cadences from the following month on.
        end_bound: The rule's closing validity bound -- indefinite, a date, or
            a count of occurrences, as ONE value
            (:class:`~app.services.recurrence.EndBound`).  Replacing it is how
            a closing bound CHANGES, which is what makes
            ``replace(spec, end_bound=...)`` safe for the one writer that owns
            a bound it did not author: ``loan_recurrence_sync`` states the
            loan's payoff and the shape it replaces cannot leave a count
            behind.  Defaults to :data:`~app.services.recurrence.NEVER_ENDS`,
            which 41 of the 46 live rules carry.
        max_per_month: The most occurrences any one calendar month admits --
            a month's first N paydays on the owner's calendar for a paycheck
            cadence -- or ``None``, the default and every rule authored before
            plan step salary:R15-a, for no ceiling (ruling **R-SAL29**, amended
            2026-09-13).  "Every paycheck, at most 2 a month" is a payroll

    fact about the rule rather than about the owner's schedule.

    **The ``PERIOD`` unit is the one that normalises, and that is what removes

    are PAYDAYS, so an authored date that is not one does not name an

            when ``max_per_month`` or ``starts_on`` is
            outside its column's domain, or when a pay-period cadence is
            resolved against an owner with no pay periods.  All are broken
            invariants: a recurrence read with a fabricated cadence is worse
            than a refused read.  The ``(starts_on, nominal_day)`` and
            ``(unit, max_per_month)`` pairs are refused by
            :class:`RecurrenceSpec` itself, before this function is reached.

            **The cadence refusal ARRIVED at plan step R7c-c**, and it arrived
            because one left.  ``_authoring._author`` called ``encode_cadence``
            before this function, which refused a cadence the closed pattern
            set could not name -- so every caller of the write door, the
            recurrence PREVIEW included, inherited a completeness check.
            Deleting the encoder took it with it, and the preview began listing
            dates for cadences the schema refuses.  Asking it HERE puts it in
            front of every consumer of a resolved value rather than only the
            ones that write.

"""The NOMINAL DAY: the 0-or-1 day a short month clamped, and its pair rule.

**Split out of** :mod:`._resolution` **at plan step salary:R15-a** as a PURE
MOVE, when the per-month ceiling's pair refusal took that module past pylint's
1000-line ceiling; every definition below is byte-for-byte what it held,
graded by AST in the same commit.  ``_resolution`` keeps the two value types
and :func:`~._resolution.resolve`; this leaf keeps the one fact those values
carry that needs a calendar arithmetic of its own.

``nominal_day`` records the day a rule MEANS when ``starts_on``'s own month was
too short to hold it -- April has no 31st, so a day-31 rule first occurring
there carries ``starts_on = 2026-04-30`` and ``nominal_day = 31`` (ruling
**R-R3**).  What lives here: the domain the column's CHECK bounds it to, the
join of the two fields into the day a rule fires on
(:func:`cadence_day_of_month`), which days a first occurrence leaves OPEN
(:func:`offerable_nominal_days`, :func:`is_offerable_nominal_day`), and the
refusal both value types hold at construction
(:func:`_require_nominal_day_pair`).

**The dependency runs ONE way**: this module imports :mod:`._frequency` and
nothing of :mod:`._resolution`, which imports it.

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.

    **The ONE reader of ``(starts_on, nominal_day)``**, which is one fact stored
    in two fields: the date holds the day unless its own month was too short to
    hold it, in which case *nominal_day* holds what the rule meant and the date
    holds the clamp (ruling R-R3).  The occurrence walk, the display describer
    and the generated row's due date all need that day, and writing the join
    three times is how the same rule comes to fire on the 31st and read as the
    30th.

    **It was a property of :class:`ResolvedRecurrence` alone until plan step
    R7c-c**, and it became a function because a second caller appeared that
    holds the pair without holding a resolved value: ``_reading``'s
    ``scheduling_day_of_month``, which answers what the dropped ``day_of_month``
    column held for ``recurrence.compute_due_date``.  Resolving a rule
    there would have required a calendar the pure ``compute_due_date`` does not
    take; open-coding the join is what this function exists to prevent.  The
    property remains, delegating here, so no consumer has to change.

    ``is None``, not truthiness: *nominal_day*'s domain is 29-31, but a

        itself -- or ``None`` for a unit that does not fire on a day of the
        month (:func:`~app.services.recurrence.has_day_of_month_coordinate`).
        ``None`` is absence rather than a
        missing value: a paycheck-space or weekly rule has no day-of-month to
        name, and answering the date's own day would invent a coordinate the
        cadence never uses.

    Until this step that something was a GUARD run at generation time
    (``_occurrence._require_generable``), backed by a CHECK that could not
    express the whole rule: ``ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day`` bounded the
    domain and required the nominal day to exceed the date's, which admits
    ``(2026-04-15, 30)`` -- a nominal day beside a date that was never clamped.
    R7c-b completes the CHECK with the clamp equality below and moves the
    in-memory half here, so both values that carry the pair
    (:class:`RecurrenceSpec` and :class:`ResolvedRecurrence`) refuse it before

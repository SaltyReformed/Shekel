"""What a recurrence's cadence IS, with no schedule to measure it against.

Plan step **R7a-2b**.  :func:`app.services.recurrence.resolve` answers what a
recurrence MEANS against one owner's pay calendar, and most of that answer does
not need the calendar at all: the interval, the unit and the placement are what
the rule itself states, and only the anchor -- where the first occurrence lands
-- needs a schedule.  This module is that schedule-free half, split out so a
consumer holding no calendar can still ask how often something repeats.

**The split is what makes the monthly equivalent possible.**
``obligations_aggregator`` turns a per-occurrence amount into a monthly one for
every recurring template on ``/savings`` and the Recurring surface, and it has
no :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar`, and neither do its
savings-dashboard callers.  (The Recurring surface DOES hold one and reads
``calendar.cadence`` off it -- an adversarial review corrected an earlier
"nor do their callers" here, which was checkable and wrong.)
Before this step it therefore could not use the two-axis vocabulary at all and
read ``pattern_id`` through a seven-branch switch, which is why a cadence plan
step R8 authors -- ``(2, MONTH)`` -- would have read "Every 2 months" in the
Recurrence cell beside a BLANK monthly figure.  One expression over
``(interval_n, unit)`` answers for every cadence, including the ones nothing
authors yet.

**The dependency runs ONE way** -- ``_resolution`` imports this module and this
module imports nothing of it -- which is what keeps the split a boundary rather
than a pair of files that need each other.

**The SEAM between two vocabularies LEFT at plan step R7c-c, and it left
because there is only one vocabulary now.**  ``budget.recurrence_rules`` stated
its cadence with a closed set of eight pattern names until then, so this module
carried the translation: ``PATTERN_DERIVATIONS`` and its computed inverse,
``encode_cadence`` (authored -> stored) and ``decode_pattern`` (stored ->
authored), plus ``stored_interval`` and ``cadence_of`` reading through them.
``interval_n`` and ``unit_id`` are authored columns from that step, so a
caller's ``(interval_n, unit, placement)`` IS what the table holds and there is
nothing to translate.  All seven are deleted; :class:`Cadence` -- the pair
itself -- :meth:`Cadence.occurrences_per_year` and the family router survive,
being facts about the two axes rather than about how they were stored.

**The ANCHOR FAMILY router LEFT at plan step R8-a, and it left because the
derivations it selected between were deleted two steps earlier.**  It arrived
here at R7b-2 as ``anchor_family`` plus three ``FAMILY_*`` constants, naming
which of three reconstructions of a rule's first occurrence a
``(unit, placement)`` pair used.  Ruling **R-R16** made that date AUTHORED:
R7c-b deleted all three derivations, and from that step
``_resolution._first_occurrence`` branches on ONE thing -- whether the unit's
occurrences are paydays.  What survived was a three-valued router selecting
between nothing, still gating the offer set, and still refusing two cadences by
naming derivations that no longer existed.  Measured before it went, over all
eight ``(unit, placement)`` pairs: the router agreed exactly with
``has_day_of_month_coordinate(unit) and placement is CONTAINING_DATE`` on every
pair it answered for, and disagreed only on the three it refused.

**The OFFER SET is derived from what a rule can DO, not from a name it can
have** (:func:`~._offer.authorable_cadences` -- the offer set and the two
predicates it rests on live in :mod:`._offer` since plan step salary:R15-a, a
pure move made when the cadence's third value took this module past pylint's
1000-line ceiling; the argument stays here, the code implements it there), and
that is plan step R7b-2's property restated on live constraints.  R7b-2 served
the form's options from the storage ENCODER, so a cadence the closed pattern
set could not name was unofferable
rather than fenced; R7c-c dropped that encoder, and R7b-2's successor gate was
this router.  TWO rules replace it, each derived from a fact stated once
elsewhere and each naming the live thing it rests on:

* the cadence's occurrences must be DATABLE onto a generated row
  (:func:`has_row_date_coordinate`) -- the ``WEEK`` unit's are not, and plan
  step R5 is what makes them so;
* the placement must be able to CHANGE the answer
  (:func:`emits_period_starts`) -- under the ``PERIOD`` unit it cannot.

The interval is not a third: :func:`require_positive_interval` predates the
router and was never gated by it, and every positive interval is authorable on
every offered pair.

**The per-month CEILING joined the vocabulary at plan step salary:R15-a**
(ruling **R-SAL29**), as a third value on :class:`Cadence` rather than a new
unit or placement: "every paycheck, at most 2 a month" is how a payroll benefit
taken on a month's first two paychecks is stated, and neither axis could say it
-- ledger row **D59** measured the developer's Health Insurance Allowance held
as an every-paycheck rule that an ``end_date`` happened to stop before the
first three-payday month.  Like the interval it is not part of an OFFER: every
positive ceiling is authorable wherever a unit can put two occurrences in a
month (:func:`can_repeat_within_month`), and refused where it cannot.

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.

    **The one statement of which units a per-month ceiling can bind** (plan

    agree: :class:`~app.services.recurrence.RecurrenceSpec` refuses a ceiling
    on any other unit, the shared recurrence schema refuses the same
    submission with a message, the picker offers the ceiling control only

    control the engine would ignore being a control the form does not show --
    and the read door that takes a STATED cadence
    (``_reading.recurrence_spec_with_cadence``) DROPS a stored ceiling where
    the stated unit cannot hold it, which is the arm a restored row meets.

    Derived from :func:`has_day_of_month_coordinate` rather than from a second
    list of units, which an adversarial review of plan step R7b-1 required of
    that predicate's own source: a cadence measured in whole months fires at
    most once a month by construction, so exactly the units WITHOUT a
    day-of-month coordinate -- paychecks and weeks -- can put a second
    occurrence in a month.  A ceiling on a monthly cadence would be a value
    the walk can never read, which is the closed-set defect this package
    removes rather than stores.

    a non-positive interval, and it says so in its own ``Args``.  A rule two
    functions rely on is one neither may state for itself.

    **The check is on the AUTHORED value, not on a pattern's own**, and the

    **Ruling R-R17, applied at the write door** (plan step R7c-c).  Freeing the
    interval makes ``(12, MONTH)`` authorable, and it is the same rhythm as
    ``(1, YEAR)``: the occurrence walk strides twelve months either way
    (:func:`~app.services.recurrence._months.months_per_step`), both have the
    same day-of-month coordinate, and both fire once a year.  Two spellings of
    one rhythm
    is the second vocabulary this arc removed from the table, arriving back
    through the form -- the Recurring surface would word the same annual bill
    "Every 12 months" on one row and "Yearly" on another, and the obligations
    filter would group them apart.

    **The PLACEMENT guard LEFT at plan step R8-a, because what it guarded
    against stopped existing.**  It caught one case:
    ``(12, MONTH, PERIOD_STARTING_ON_OR_AFTER)`` was authorable while its YEAR
    spelling was not, so rewriting it would have turned a storable cadence into
    a refusal at the door about to store it.  That asymmetry was the
    anchor-family router refusing a year-scale deferred cadence on a derivation
    R7c-b had already deleted; R8-a admits the pair, and MONTH and YEAR are now
    authorable on exactly the same placements BY DERIVATION rather than by
    coincidence -- both have a day-of-month coordinate, neither emits period
    starts, so :func:`authorable_cadences`' two rules answer identically for
    them at every placement.  Re-checking it here would be a fence over a state
    the offer set cannot produce; ``test_recurrence_frequency`` proves the
    property over every placement instead.

    The stride is read through ``months_per_step`` rather than compared against
    a literal twelve, so this function states no month arithmetic of its own --
    the same rule ``_occurrence`` follows for the walk it seeds.

            makes is months-to-years, and a ceiling cannot sit on either of

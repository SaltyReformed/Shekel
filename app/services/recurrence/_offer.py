"""The OFFER SET: which cadences a rule may be authored on, and why.

**The offer-set half of** :mod:`._frequency`, **split out at plan step
salary:R15-a** when the per-month ceiling took that module past pylint's
1000-line ceiling (its 895 lines were 90% of it before the cadence's third
value arrived, so the room the C12-a package split bought the paycheck engine
was never here).  A leaf per concern is the answer this project has given the
same measurement four times -- ``pay_calendar``, ``cash_ledger``,
``transaction_service``, ``paycheck_calculator`` -- and it is a PURE MOVE:
every definition below is byte-for-byte what :mod:`._frequency` held, graded
by AST in the same commit.  The argument for the offer set being DERIVED from
what a rule can DO rather than from a name it can have stays in
:mod:`._frequency`'s own docstring, which this leaf implements.

What lives here: the two predicates the offer set is derived from
(:func:`has_row_date_coordinate`, :func:`emits_period_starts`), the transitional
refusal the first of them backs (:func:`require_row_date_coordinate`), the
row-dating question the picker asks of a PAIR (:func:`fires_on_day_of_month`),
the offer itself (:class:`AuthorableCadence`, :func:`authorable_cadences`) and
the two doors that ask it of a submission (:func:`is_authorable`,
:func:`require_authorable_cadence`).

**The dependency runs ONE way**: this module imports :mod:`._frequency` -- the
unit facts, the interval floor and the error class -- and that module imports
nothing of this one, which is what keeps the split a boundary.

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.

    **The offer set's first rule, and the one that keeps the ``WEEK`` unit out
    of it** (plan step R8-a).  A generated row's date is
    :func:`~app.services.recurrence.compute_due_date`, which has exactly two
    sources: the rule's scheduling DAY OF THE MONTH, or -- when it has none --
    the funding paycheck's own ``start_date``.  A unit whose occurrences are
    neither is a unit whose rows cannot carry the date the cadence names:

    * ``PERIOD`` -- an occurrence IS a payday, so the paycheck's ``start_date``
      is the occurrence exactly (:func:`emits_period_starts`);
    * ``MONTH`` / ``YEAR`` -- the occurrence is a day of the month, which the
      row is dated from directly under ``CONTAINING_DATE`` and which the
      DEFERRING placement deliberately trades for the later paycheck's payday,
      a substitution the display describer words ("first paycheck") so the user
      is told;
    * ``WEEK`` -- neither.  Its coordinate is a WEEKDAY, which
      ``compute_due_date`` cannot express, so every weekly row would be dated
      on the payday with nothing saying so and the authored weekday silently
      discarded.

    **This is the LIVE constraint that replaced a dead one.**  Until plan step
    R8-a the ``WEEK`` unit was refused by ``anchor_family``, whose stated reason
    was that the unit "anchors on an authored date this vocabulary does not yet
    collect" -- true until ruling **R-R16** made ``starts_on`` authored for
    every unit at R7c-b, and a fossil after it.  Measured on this branch:
    lifting that refusal alone made a ``(2, WEEK)`` rule resolve, walk, place
    and word itself correctly, and its generated rows would still every one of
    them have carried the wrong date.

    **It dies at plan step R5**, which gives a generated row its own
    ``occurs_on`` and deletes ``compute_due_date`` -- so this predicate goes
    with the function whose two sources it names, and the ``WEEK`` unit becomes
    authorable by the deletion rather than by a second edit.  Plan ledger rows
    **D26** (a generated row's date has two producers and the engine discards
    the occurrence) and **D18** are the same function's other faces.

    Package-internal rather than exported: it is a statement about a
    transitional limit, and a consumer outside this package asking it would be
    a second reader to update when R5 removes it.

    **The producer the form serves its options from**, which is what makes a
    cadence the application cannot honour unofferable rather than fenced behind
    a refusal.  Plan step R7b-2 gave the picker that property by deriving its
    options from the storage ENCODER; R7c-c dropped the encoder and left the
    anchor-family router holding the gate; plan step **R8-a** replaced the
    router, which by then selected between derivations ruling **R-R16** had
    deleted, with the two live constraints below.

    Two rules, each derived from a fact stated once elsewhere rather than from
    a list of units kept here:

    * the cadence's occurrences must be DATABLE onto a generated row
      (:func:`has_row_date_coordinate`).  ``WEEK`` is the one unit that is
      neither a payday nor a day of the month, so
      ``recurrence.compute_due_date`` has nothing to date its rows
      from; plan step **R5** deletes that function and the rule with it;
    * the placement must be able to CHANGE the answer
      (:func:`emits_period_starts`).  A pay-period cadence's occurrences are
      paydays and both placements carry a payday back to its own paycheck, so
      offering the choice would render a control the engine ignores.

    **What R8-a WIDENED, and it is one reading**: a year-scale cadence funded
    from the first paycheck on or after its date.  The router refused it
    because ``_resolution._first_of_month_anchor`` -- deleted at R7c-b -- would
    have anchored it on "the 1st of the first qualifying month", firing it in
    whichever month the owner's schedule happened to open in.  With
    ``starts_on`` authored there is no such derivation and no such month: the
    rule fires on its own date every ``interval_n`` years and defers onto the
    next paycheck, exactly as its MONTH twin already did.  Measured on a
    2026-08-16 production clone: 0 of 46 live rules read differently, and a
    yearly cadence cannot put two occurrences in one paycheck at ANY cadence in
    ``pay_schedule.cadence_days``' whole 1-365 domain.  That mattered while
    the generation index was keyed on the paycheck and a repeat was REFUSED;
    plan step **R17** re-keyed it onto the occurrence, so a repeat now stores
    and the observation is a statement about the cadence rather than about
    exposure.

    The INTERVAL is not part of an offer.  Every positive interval is authorable
    for every unit here, which is what the form's free number box renders and
    what ``ck_recurrence_rules_positive_interval`` is the whole of the domain
    for.

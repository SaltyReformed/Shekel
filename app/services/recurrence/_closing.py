"""
Shekel Budget App -- Everything that stops a definition (plan step R7d-d)

A recurring definition stops for more than one reason, and only one of them is
written on the rule.  :mod:`app.services.recurrence._bounds` owns the bound the
OWNER AUTHORS -- indefinitely, on a date, after a count -- which the form
offers, the schema accepts and two columns store.  This module owns the other
kind: a stop the definition did not author, DERIVED from something outside the
rule, and the value that holds both.

Why the second kind exists at all
---------------------------------

A recurring transfer that pays a loan stops when the debt does, whatever its
rule says.  Until plan step R7d that fact was CACHED into the authored bound's
own column -- ten call sites wrote ``budget.recurrence_rules.end_date`` from the
loan's derived payoff between them -- so one column held two facts and every
reader was trusting that some earlier write had been recent enough.  That is
``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14's stored-and-derived case: the column is a stale cache
with no reconciler, and the remedy is to delete a home rather than keep two in
step.

Deleting it leaves the question this module answers: the two stops are
different KINDS, they are both real, and something has to hold them together.

**They are ANDed, never substituted.**  A definition fires only while BOTH
allow it, and each direction of getting that wrong costs money.  Ignore the
authored bound and the app models cash the owner has said will stop moving;
ignore the derived one and it projects payments against a debt that is gone.

The composition is a VALUE, not a step every reader performs
------------------------------------------------------------

:class:`Closing` holds both and answers for both, and
:attr:`~app.services.recurrence.ResolvedRecurrence.closing` is where a resolved
recurrence carries it.  So the occurrence walk narrows WITHOUT gaining a
parameter: whatever narrowing the value carries travels with it through any
call depth, and no caller re-threads it.

An optional ``narrowed_by=`` argument on the walk would have been a smaller
diff, and it would have left each of the five surfaces that ask "does this
still fire" -- generation, the Recurring surface's next date, its cadence
sentence, the ``/obligations`` and ``/savings`` totals, and the recurrence
form's preview -- one forgotten keyword from a plausible wrong answer that
nothing raises on.

**What that does NOT yet buy is unreachability, and an adversarial review of
this step corrected an earlier paragraph here for claiming it.**
:func:`~app.services.recurrence.resolve` builds a :class:`Closing` with no
derived half, because a spec names no destination and this package cannot fold
a balance -- so ``resolved_recurrence``, ``read_rule`` and ``rule_occurrences``
all still hand back a value nothing has narrowed, and every production reader
takes one today.  The composed door is what narrows; a caller that goes round
it gets the rule's own answer, which is correct for the definitions that have
no derived stop and incomplete for the ones that do.  The encoding gets
stronger as the remaining R7d leaves move their readers onto the door, and
only when the last one has is "a caller cannot reach the un-narrowed answer"
a claim this module may make.

**The derived stop's SHAPES are here and its RESOLVER is not.**  Deciding
which shape applies means folding a loan's balance, which needs the balance
seam -- and no module in this package imports ``balance_at``, nor may one:
:func:`app.services.loan_recurrence_sync.loan_payment_window` is the resolver
and it imports this package, so the arrow is one-way and the reverse would be a
cycle.  (The package is not ORM-free -- ``_authoring`` holds the write door and
flushes -- so the line that matters is the seam, not the ORM.)  The shapes are
plain values over dates, so they live where every consumer can see them: the
walk in :mod:`app.services.recurrence._occurrence`, and the phrase-writer in
:mod:`app.services.recurrence._describe`, which could not import the loan module
at all.  Rule 14 in its placement clause: where a layer puts the shared leaf out
of reach, MOVE THE LEAF.

**No IDENTIFIER here names a loan**, which is what keeps the vocabulary honest
even though the docstrings below use loans as their worked examples.  A loan is
one supplier of a derived stop, and a savings goal that is met or a card that is
closed could supply another.

Pure: no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.

    What something OUTSIDE the rule allows, as one value with three shapes
    rather than the ``date``-or-``None`` pair the cached column collapsed it
    to.  That pair spells two of the three alike: a real closing date and a
    window that closed before the definition ever fired are both a ``date``,
    and telling them apart is what ``ck_recurrence_rules_valid_window`` was
    drafted for and then held back on (plan ledger row **D35**).  An owner
    AUTHORING a stop before a start has made a mistake to report; a loan trued
    to zero before its first installment has an empty window that is CORRECT at
    nought occurrences, and a CHECK that cannot tell those apart turns a
    true-up into an unhandled ``CheckViolation``.

    **Every shape answers :meth:`admits`, and this base implements none of
    it.**  A default here -- "a shape that does not recognise the question
    keeps firing" -- is the partial-function-over-a-closed-set defect this arc
    exists to remove, and on a loan it would go on charging a debt the owner
    has cleared.  ``@abstractmethod`` makes a half-written fourth shape
    unconstructible rather than merely wrong; :class:`EndBound` states the same
    contract one concept over, and for the same reason.

    **It is NOT an** :class:`EndBound`, deliberately.  That type is what the
    form OFFERS, the schema ACCEPTS and the two columns STORE, so each of its
    shapes owes a ``token``, a ``from_payload`` and a ``columns()``.  A derived
    stop is none of those things: nothing offers it, nothing posts it, and
    after plan step R7d-g nothing stores it.  Adding a shape there would put an
    unauthorable, unstorable member in the closed set the picker is derived
    from.

    **Every shape answers :meth:`has_closed` too, since plan step R7d-e**,
    which is the question ``obligations_aggregator`` asks to decide whether a
    commitment still belongs in the ``/obligations`` and ``/savings`` monthly
    totals.  Until that step the aggregator asked it of the AUTHORED bound
    alone (:func:`app.services.recurrence.has_ended` read the rule's own
    columns), so a retired loan's payment went on inflating both totals until
    some chokepoint happened to rewrite the cached column -- and left them the
    day it did, which is a fact about when a page was saved rather than about
    the loan.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Reading a stored recurrence rule (plan step R4b-2)

The door a written recurrence is READ through, symmetric with
:mod:`app.services.recurrence._authoring`, which is the door one is written
through.  One composition and its projections:

* :func:`recurrence_spec` -- a rule row's authored state, back out as the
  :class:`~app.services.recurrence.RecurrenceSpec` that authored it.  The write
  door's partial-change idiom is built on it (read the spec, replace one fact
  with ``dataclasses.replace``, re-author the whole value), which is why it is
  a READ living beside the other reads rather than inside the writer.
* :func:`read_rule` -- **THE composition**: resolve the row against the
  owner's schedule, then walk and place its occurrences, keeping BOTH halves.
* :func:`resolved_recurrence` -- the first half alone, for a caller that wants
  what the rule MEANS and not where its rows land.
* :func:`rule_occurrences` -- the second half alone, the shape three surfaces
  and the frozen baseline have always taken.
* :func:`placed_periods` -- the projection three surfaces take of that answer.

**One caller needs both halves, and that is why :func:`read_rule` exists**
(plan step R7a).  The Recurring surface resolves every rule to date its "Next"
column and now also to describe its cadence; composing the two steps at the
call site would put the resolve-then-place sequence in two places, so the
composition lives here once and the page takes the value whole.  Nothing is
computed and discarded: a caller that wants only the meaning
(:func:`resolved_recurrence`) never walks an occurrence.

Four surfaces ask :func:`rule_occurrences` the same question, and they must not
be able to disagree:

* ``recurrence_engine.resolve_generation_plan``, the generation seam both
  engines share, which turns the answer into rows;
* ``recurring_view``, whose next-date column must name the date the grid cell
  it points at will carry;
* ``routes._recurrence_preview``, the form's live "next five occurrences"
  fragment, which must show what saving would produce;
* ``tests.oracles.recurrence_baseline``, the frozen behaviour snapshot every
  step of the redesign is measured against.

**This replaced ``recurrence_engine.match_periods``** (plan step R4b-2).  That
adapter answered in PERIODS and applied a caller's lower window bound itself,
so two facts were computed and thrown away: the occurrence DATE, which the
repeat refusal needed to name (plan ledger row D19), and WHY an occurrence had
no pay period (row D7).  Both are in the answer now.  The lower bound went back
to the callers that have one, because it is a display / regeneration boundary
rather than a property of the recurrence, and conflating those two is what
defect D2 was.

It lives here rather than in ``recurrence_engine`` because it writes nothing:
that module carries the session, the models and the row-creation state machine,
and three of the four callers above want none of it.  It lives here rather than
in ``_occurrence`` because it takes an ORM row, and ``_occurrence`` is pure by
contract.

Flask-isolated and read-only: it touches no session and issues no query -- the
owner's schedule arrives as a
:class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar` the caller already holds.

    The placement half of :func:`read_rule`, and the shape the generation seam,
    the form preview and the frozen baseline have taken since plan step R4b-2.

    **The rule's own window is applied, and a caller cannot bypass it.**
    ``start_date`` binds through the anchor
    :func:`~app.services.recurrence.resolve` derives and ``end_date`` through
    the occurrence engine's stopping bound (ruling R-R6), so a loan payment's
    ``start_date`` still guarantees no installment is generated before the loan
    originates (plan step C9a).  Before plan step R4a both bounds filtered
    candidate PERIODS instead -- ``end_date`` against a period's START -- which
    generated rows dated outside the window the user set (defect D5).

    **A period can appear TWICE, and that is the honest answer.**  At a pay
    cadence of 30 days or more a monthly bill legitimately occurs several times
    inside one paycheck; the reverse matcher walked PAYCHECKS and so silently
    emitted one row for three months of rent (defect D3).
    ``budget.transactions`` HOLDS the separate rows since plan step **R17**:
    ``idx_transactions_template_scenario_occurrence`` is unique over
    ``(template, scenario, occurs_on)``, so a paycheck a cadence names twice
    stores both rows and the WRITE path no longer refuses.  This function
    reports what the cadence NAMES; it does not decide what is storable, which
    is why it rendered the repeats even while they were refused.

    **An occurrence with no pay period is REPORTED, and since plan step C2-b2
    that means ONE thing**: the saved schedule does not reach it, which is every
    schedule's ordinary tail rather than a signal.  The other reading -- a
    schedule HOLE, plan ledger row D7 -- went unconstructible when the calendar
    began deriving each period's end from the next payday, and the
    ``PlacementOutcome`` that told the two apart went with it.

    Args:
        rule: The stored (or transient) recurrence rule.
        calendar: The OWNER's WHOLE pay-period schedule, which the rule's first
            occurrence is measured against.  A subset resolves the rule against
            a pay history the owner does not have -- plan ledger rows D22, D25
            and D2, all measured live on production, all closed at plan step
            R4b-1 by making the schedule a value
            (:class:`~app.services.generation_schedule.GenerationSchedule`).

    Returns:
        One :class:`~app.services.recurrence.OccurrencePlacement` per
        occurrence through the schedule's horizon, ascending by occurrence
        date.  The resolver's own value type rather than ORM rows: this is a
        pure question about a schedule, and the one caller that must WRITE a
        row already holds the owner's rows to map ``period_id`` back onto.

    Raises:
        RecurrenceResolutionError: When the rule cannot be resolved against
            *calendar* -- an unmodelled pattern, a non-positive interval, a
            day / month outside its column's domain, or a rule paired with
            another user's schedule.  The reverse matcher answered ``[]`` for
            the first of those and ``ValueError`` for the third; both now name
            the offending value.  **An EMPTY schedule is the one refusal this
            answers as an empty tuple** -- see :func:`resolved_recurrence`,
            which holds that guard.
        RecurrenceGenerationError: When the resolved value names something the
            occurrence engine cannot walk -- a business-day shift (plan step R8

    emergency-fund baseline.

    **It replaced a direct ``rule.end_date < as_of`` read, which had no answer
    for a count bound at all** (plan step R7b-3).  That read was correct while
    a date was the only bound anything wrote; the moment the "Ends" control
    could author "after N occurrences", a spent count would have gone on
    inflating both figures forever -- while the SAME row's "Next" column, which
    walks occurrences, showed blank.  One row disagreeing with itself about
    whether a commitment is over.

    **It answers the RULE's bound, never the schedule's reach.**  A rule whose
    remaining occurrences fall past the materialised horizon has not ended; the
    schedule simply has not been extended to them, and answering "ended" there
    would silently drop a live commitment out of two money totals.  Each shape
    states its own test for telling those apart, from the horizon

    ledger row **D33**).  The date shape used to answer the narrower "has the
    bound date passed", so a yearly bill bounded at year end went on counting
    for eleven months after its last payment while the same schedule written as
    a count did not.

    The bound is read from the row's own columns rather than through
    :func:`recurrence_spec`, so a rule naming a pattern this application no
    longer models still answers -- and so the UNBOUNDED shape, which is 41 of

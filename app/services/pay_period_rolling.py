"""
Shekel Budget App -- The rolling pay-period window.

The ONE opportunistic, non-destructive schedule writer, split out of
``pay_period_admin`` at plan step **C4** (ledger row **P31**).  That module
holds the four DESTRUCTIVE doors -- extend, truncate, regenerate, reset -- each
of which a user initiates and each of which can take money's paycheck away from
it.  This one is none of those things: nothing asks for it, ``/grid`` and
``/dashboard`` call it on every render, and all it may do is APPEND paydays the
owner's own stored cadence already implies.

**The split is a SHAPE rather than a size fix, and the size is how it was
found.**  ``pay_period_admin``'s own module docstring named its subject as "the
lock classifier and extend / truncate / regenerate" and did not mention the
top-up, which is the seam stated and then not drawn.  It stood at 991 of
pylint's 1,000-line ceiling, so plan step C4's first commit -- ONE reader moved
off a dropped column -- could not fit, and the room would have come from
deleting prose.  That is finding **P31** exactly: "answered the ceiling by
trimming prose rather than by having a shape".

Flask-isolated, like the module it left: it takes and returns plain data, never
imports ``request`` / ``session``, and never commits (the route owns the
transaction).  It DECIDES and delegates -- every row it adds goes through
``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` and thence ``pay_period_write``, the one
place in ``app/`` that changes ``budget.pay_periods``.  The dependency runs one
way: this module imports that one, and nothing there reaches back.

**It RETURNS the periods it appended, where it returned a count** (plan step
R7d-c-1, ruling **R-R38**).  The append leaves them EMPTY: the door it calls
no longer generates the recurring rows, because the read pass that generation
resolves in may only be opened above this layer, and a count is not something
a caller can populate.  So the two render routes that call this --
:func:`app.routes.grid.page.index` and :func:`app.routes.dashboard.page` --
hand what comes back to
:func:`app.routes._period_population.populate_new_periods` inside the same
``write_transaction`` block.  A caller that drops the return value creates
paydays with no rent, no paycheck and no recurring transfer in them, which is
why the routes' own tests assert the ROWS rather than the period count.

**Nothing here reads ``end_date`` or ``period_index``**, the two columns plan
step C4-c dropped -- and that stays a graded property rather than a
consequence, because
:class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` still carries both names.
``test_pay_period_admin.TestTheDestructiveDoorsHoldNoDerivedColumn`` censuses
this module and ``pay_period_admin`` for either name on ANY receiver, so a
future edit cannot regrow the read on a derived value either.

def top_up_rolling_window(user_id, as_of=None):
    """Generate periods to keep the rolling window N ahead of today.

    The on-request continuous-mode top-up, called from the grid and
    dashboard entry points (the only routes that consume future
    periods).  No scheduler exists, so the window is refilled lazily on
    page load.

    Cheap and idempotent.  When rolling is disabled (or the user has no
    schedule row) it does ZERO write work and takes NO lock -- one tiny
    schedule read.  Otherwise it counts the current-and-future periods
    (those whose DERIVED end falls on or after ``as_of``, which INCLUDES
    the period containing ``as_of``, so "keep N ahead" counts the current
    period as one of the N) and, only if short of the target, takes the
    per-user advisory lock, RE-READS the schedule and RE-COUNTS under it
    (another request may have just filled the window or moved the
    cadence), and appends exactly the deficit via
    :func:`~app.services.pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`, which leaves
    the new periods EMPTY for the caller to populate (see the module
    docstring).

    Correctness against a duplicate payday comes from
    ``UNIQUE(user_id, start_date)``; the lock + re-count is the UX
    layer that lets a racing loser cleanly create nothing instead of
    hitting that constraint as a 500.

    **It passes no cadence, and that is not a saving of one argument.**  It
    used to hand ``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` the schedule row's own
    ``cadence_days``, which is exactly what ``resolve_cadence`` answers for an
    owner who has a row -- and this function returns before the append unless
    one exists.  A redundant pass-through of a value the callee re-reads is a
    second place for the two to come apart; plan step C3-b deleted the
    parameter at every door (finding **P29**).

    Args:
        user_id: The owning user's id.
        as_of: Reference date for "current and future".  Defaults to the
            OWNER's civil day (``utils.dates.display_today``) rather than the
            process clock, ruled 2026-08-19 with the lock classifier's -- this
            counts the owner's remaining paychecks, so it is their day that
            decides how many there are.  Both live callers (``/grid`` and
            ``/dashboard``) pass none.

    Returns:
        The newly created :class:`~app.models.pay_period.PayPeriod` rows,
        flushed and EMPTY -- the caller populates them.  An empty list when
        rolling is disabled, the window is already full, or a concurrent
        top-up filled it first.

    """Count the user's current-and-future periods (those not ended by *as_of*).

    Includes the period containing ``as_of``, so this is the count the rolling
    target is compared against: "keep N ahead" counts the current period as one
    of the N.  The rule is
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.current_and_future`.

    **It DERIVES the ends rather than reading them** (plan step C4, finding
    **P70**): this was the module's last query naming a column plan step C4-c
    dropped -- ``PayPeriod.end_date >= as_of``, counted in SQL -- and no period
    end is named here at all.

    **It loads at the schedule facts the caller HOLDS rather than calling**
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for`, which would re-read the
    schedule row :func:`top_up_rolling_window` already has.  It takes the
    FACTS rather than the two columns, which is what plan step balance:X-bh-2
    made matter: a calendar needs both, and
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_schedule_service.ScheduleFacts.of` is the one
    place that says which columns those are -- so a third calendar fact
    reaches here without this signature moving.  Plain data rather than the
    ORM row, for this package's standing reason: the row carries the rolling
    configuration too, and a helper that took it could quietly start reading
    a field that is not a calendar fact at all.  It cannot take a
    read pass's calendar instead -- ``/grid`` and ``/dashboard`` run the top-up
    BEFORE they open one, deliberately, so that pass sees the rows this
    creates.

    **What that costs, stated rather than absorbed** (adversarial review,
    2026-08-25).  It is the same ONE query the ``COUNT(*)`` was, and the
    schedule read ledger rows **P68** and **P69** record is not doubled -- but
    the render now runs the DERIVATION twice, where the SQL count ran it not at
    all.  That second derivation is unavoidable while the top-up precedes the
    pass, so it is pinned rather than removed:
    ``test_one_read_pass_per_render.test_a_rolling_owner_derives_TWICE_and_that_is_the_bound``
    holds it at exactly two.  Its cost is a payday set and N frozen dataclasses
    rather than one integer -- 62 rows on production, immaterial there and
    growing with an owner's history, which is the axis nothing bounds.

    Args:
        user_id: The owning user's id.
        facts: The caller's own resolved schedule facts.  ``cadence_days`` is
            read only for the LAST period's end, so a stale one can move
            exactly one period in or out of this count; ``history_opens_on``
            is not read by this question at all and travels only because a
            calendar carries both -- and dropping it here would build a
            calendar that lies about the owner's rhythm.

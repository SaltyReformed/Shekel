"""
Shekel Budget App -- Reading a recurring DEFINITION (plan step R7d-d)

The one door that reads a recurring definition against a read pass, composing
what its RULE means with what its DESTINATION allows.

:mod:`app.services.recurrence` answers the first half and is pure: given a rule
and the owner's pay calendar it resolves the cadence, the first occurrence and
the bound the owner AUTHORED.  It cannot answer the second half, because
deciding whether something outside the rule stops the definition means folding
a loan's balance forward -- the ORM and the balance seam, neither of which that
package may import.  This module is where the two meet.

Why it is a door and not a helper
---------------------------------

**A definition can be stopped by something it did not author, and every
surface that asks "does this still fire" has to honour both stops.**  A
recurring transfer that pays a loan stops when the debt does.  Until plan step
R7d that fact reached the walk only as a CACHE: ten call sites WROTE the
loan's derived payoff into ``budget.recurrence_rules.end_date``, the authored
bound's own column, so one column held two facts and every reader was trusting
that some earlier write was recent enough (plan ledger row **D35**).  That is
``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14's stored-and-derived case, and the remedy is to delete a
home rather than keep two in step -- which plan step R7d-g did: the writers
are gone, the cache is NULLed (ruling **R-R80**) and
``ck_recurrence_rules_valid_window`` holds on every row.

Deleting it left five surfaces that each need the conjunction: generation,
this surface's next date, its cadence sentence, the ``/obligations`` and
``/savings`` monthly totals, and the recurrence form's preview.  **Written by
hand in five places that is five chances to drift**, and the drift would be
silent -- a forgotten narrowing admits occurrences against a debt that is gone
and nothing raises.

So the conjunction is not a step a reader performs.  It is a VALUE
(:class:`~app.services.recurrence.Closing`) carried by the resolved recurrence
this door returns, and the walk that already reads that value narrows without
gaining a parameter.  A reader that takes this door cannot reach the
un-narrowed answer by forgetting an argument.  A reader that goes ROUND the
door still can: ``resolve`` builds a value with no derived half, because the
pure package cannot fold a balance.  **Generation takes this door since plan
step R7d-c-2** (``recurrence_engine.resolve_generation_plan`` reads
:func:`read_definition` over the pass its schedule carries), which was the one
reader that MOVES MONEY, and the form's live preview takes it since plan step
R7d-f-2 (:func:`resolved_submission`, over the transient definition the
request composes); what still goes round it in ``app/`` (re-read 2026-09-13)
is two readers that ask no closing question at all -- the write
door's refusal of the unresolvable and the opening-bound comparison in
``loan_recurrence_sync._sync_loan_cadence`` -- and the balance seam's own
definition walk (``balance_at._plan_definitions``, plan step R16-b-2), which
must not take this door because the derived stop it would compose is that
fold's own output (ruling **R-R65**); it reads the pass's memoised resolution
of the rule under its authored closing alone (:mod:`app.services.recurrence._closing`
states the same census).

What it does NOT do
-------------------

It resolves; it decides no policy of its own.  ``None`` back from
:func:`~app.services.loan_recurrence_sync.loan_payment_window` means "no
derived source bounds this definition" -- a transaction template pays into no
account at all, and a transfer into a savings account has no derived stop --
and that is carried through as a :class:`~app.services.recurrence.Closing` with
no derived half rather than translated into some neutral shape.

**It applied ONE policy until plan step R7d-g, and that policy's subject is
gone.**  Ruling **R-R56** (developer, 2026-09-04) had it read a closing
bound the APP wrote as the cache it was, not as the owner's word: for the
definition :func:`~app.services.balance_at.is_standing_loan_payment` names,
the column held the ten chokepoints' cached payoff, and composed as authored
a cache EARLIER than the fresh derivation (plan ledger row **D35**'s measured
shape, ``2029-01-22`` stored against ``2029-02-22`` derived) would still have
bound.  So the door composed ``authored=NEVER_ENDS`` for that definition
through an arm the seam stated once (``authored_closing``) and three readers
shared.  The arm carried three limits, because the schema recorded who wrote
a bound nowhere: it answered "does the app write this bound" and not "did it
write the value there now", so an owner's word in that column -- written
before the create door refused one (ruling **R-R60**), on a second transfer
promoted by the archiving of the first, or on an archived transfer edited
and unarchived (plan ledger row **REC-522**) -- was read as the cache; an
ARCHIVED loan payment's cached column was read as its owner's bound in the
Archived drawer; and kept past the column's writers the arm would have read
those owners' words as the cache forever.  R7d-g deleted the writers, NULLed
the cache on the standing payment of every loan and on every archived
transfer into one (ruling **R-R80**), and deleted the arm with them:
**a stored closing bound is its owner's word, for every definition**, and it
is honoured when the definition becomes the standing payment with no
submission to refuse it at (ruling **R-R82**; the loan's own payment
carries no authored stop is a rule the submission doors enforce, rulings
**R-R60** and **R-R77**, and R7d-g-2 adds the archived edit door).

Flask-isolated (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): it takes a template and a read
pass and returns plain values, reads no ``request`` / ``session``, opens no
transaction and writes nothing.  **It takes the pass and never builds one** --
the 2026-08-16 ruling that a producer below the route does not call
``BalanceContext.build`` -- so the calendar a rule is resolved against and the
pass its derived stop is resolved in cannot be two values that disagree.

    else about a definition's identity reaches the derived stop.

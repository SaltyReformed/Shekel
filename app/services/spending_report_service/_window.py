"""Which window, which rows, and the trailing series the hero is derived from.

The Spending report's first act: turn a :class:`._types.SpendingWindow` into
period ids, a date span and a human label; load that window's settled expenses;
and DERIVE the trailing same-type series the chart draws and the hero's
vs-prior / vs-average chips are read off -- so the chart and the chips cannot
disagree.  That series was a per-slot backwards WALK until plan step C2-f3d,
whose pay-period arm ran a stored-ordinal query per bar; it is now one
derivation over the calendar the scope already carries (:func:`_series_windows`).

:func:`_spent_total` lives here rather than with the hero because BOTH read it:
a window's total is what :func:`_load_window` answers for a prior window and
what the hero reports for the chosen one, and two spellings of "what did this
window spend" is the drift the shared series exists to prevent.

    """Return the chart's :data:`_CHART_WINDOW_COUNT` windows, chosen last.

    **The whole series in ONE derivation, which is what plan step C2-f3d
    bought.**  Each slot used to be resolved by its own ``_shift_window(window,
    steps)`` call, and for a ``"pay_period"`` window each of those eleven calls
    ran a ``WHERE period_index = <chosen> - <steps>`` query against
    ``budget.pay_periods`` -- a NINTH hand-rolled period search (ledger row
    **P45**), reading the stored ordinal plan step **C4** drops, on a render
    that already holds the owner's whole derived calendar.  A run of
    consecutive paychecks ending at a known one is exactly what
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.window` answers, so the
    eleven searches collapse into one slice and the ordinal walk stops existing
    rather than moving from SQL into Python.

    **On a schedule whose stored ordinals agree with payday order the answer is
    unchanged, and THAT equality is structural rather than measured**: a derived
    ``period_index`` is the period's position in the owner's payday order and
    runs ``0..n-1`` dense (:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.derive_periods`),
    so the ordinal range ``[chosen - 11, chosen)`` names the same eleven
    predecessors the eleven queries found one at a time, and a range reaching
    below zero simply comes back short -- which is the blank leading slot the
    queries produced by matching nothing.

    **TWO classes of answer DO change, and both change toward the right one.**

    *The stored ordinal can be wrong and the derived one cannot.*  This arc's
    own taxonomy names three expressible faults in that column
    (:mod:`app.services.pay_calendar`): an index out of payday order, a gap,
    and an overlap.  The first TRANSPOSED two bars, taking the vs-prior
    baseline with them.  The second cost the walk a SLOT: an unmatched
    ordinal left a blank bar mid-chart, so eleven steps reached only ten
    paychecks and the series began one paycheck LATER than it should --
    which moves the vs-average wherever the twelfth slot is occupied
    (measured on a twenty-period owner: `$1,300.00` against a true
    `$1,250.00`; on a ten-period one only the bar POSITIONS move, since both
    sides then hold the same six windows).  Neither fault is constructible
    here: the periods are derived from the paydays, so their ordinals are
    dense and in payday order by construction.

    *An unknown ``period_id`` resolves nothing rather than something.*  The
    walk read it with an UNSCOPED ``db.session.get``, so another owner's id
    supplied an ordinal and then THIS owner's paychecks beneath it --
    :func:`_resolve_window` states why the calendar closes that door and why it
    hardens rather than fixes.  **What moves is more than the blank slots**:
    ``[-2]`` is the prior window, so the hero's vs-prior and vs-average chips,
    every per-category delta and every By-change row moved with it.

    Every slot is filled, including the ones no window exists for, so index
    arithmetic on the result is stable: the chosen window is always ``[-1]``
    and its prior is always ``[-2]``, which is what :mod:`._hero` reads its two
    baselines off and what the chart's ``viewed_index`` / ``compare_index``
    name.  **The pay-period arm seats each paycheck at its own ordinal OFFSET,
    and that is a READING choice rather than a safety one** -- mutation
    testing of this step showed appending and left-padding to be an equivalent
    mutant that no test can distinguish, because the calendar's ordinals are
    dense (``test_pay_calendar_derivation`` asserts that directly) and the
    slice therefore always arrives ascending and gap-free.  What the offset
    buys is that the assignment names the same ordinal range that selected the
    period, so it is checkable at the line rather than by carrying the density
    argument to it.

    Args:
        ids: The report's scope, whose ``calendar`` answers the pay-period
            arm.  A calendar built by
            :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.calendar_for` holds only
            MATERIALISED periods, which is what makes every ``period_id``
            below a real ``budget.pay_periods.id``;
            :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.window` does not

    Returns:
        :data:`_CHART_WINDOW_COUNT` entries, oldest first, the chosen window
        last.  An entry is ``None`` where no window exists, which happens two

        owner's first payday, or the chosen id names none of their periods.  A
        ``"month"`` / ``"year"`` series is calendar arithmetic and always names
        a window -- whether such a window has any DATA is

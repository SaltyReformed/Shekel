"""WHICH budget line holds a purchase a bank line became, and when it CLOSES.

Split out of :mod:`._create` at plan step ``bank_import:X-ge``, when that
module passed this project's 1,000-line bound.  **The seam is a SUBJECT and not
a line count** -- the same cut :mod:`._rules` / :mod:`._stating` was made on,
and :mod:`._creations` before it.  :mod:`._create` answers *what is this bank
line, as a purchase*: which line may be recorded, which days it carries, what
the act brought into existence.  Everything here answers the other question the
door has to settle before it can write anything: **which budget line CONTAINS
it**, and what closing that container means.

Two subjects, two reasons to change.  The container's rules move when the
budget's shape does -- ruling **R-FX**'s settled-row clause, finding
**N-327**'s one-envelope-per-answer-per-period registry, ruling **R-ED**'s
"the seam owns the day" -- and the purchase's move when the bank's record does.
Nothing changed on the way across.

**The offer set is the SCREEN's, and that is the property everything here
rests on.**  A destination this module will accept is one
:func:`~._destinations.destinations_for` returns, narrowed by what the acting
pass has already claimed -- so a row the screen may not offer cannot be reached
by crafting a request, and a row it does offer cannot be refused a tier deeper.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in, no
Flask import, no clock read.  It MUTATES and does NOT commit -- the route owns
the unit of work.

    """What ONE request has already minted or placed, so a press converges.

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-4``, finding **N-327**, developer ruling
    2026-08-20.  A merchant rule answering *a new envelope called X* used to
    mint one PER LINE: measured on the developer's own statement, a ``Lowe's``
    answer places 4 lines over 3 pay periods, so one press made 4 envelopes,
    two of them in the SAME period.  No figure was wrong -- each closes at its
    own purchases -- and what fragmented was the budget.

    **Keyed on the DEFINITION since leaf 7b-3 of ``balance:X-bi-7b``**
    (ruling **R-BAL24**, finding **N-328**).  A new-envelope answer mints ONE
    rule-less definition the first time it fires in a press -- ``by_answer``
    remembers which, per ``(name, category_id)`` -- and every later line of
    that answer, or of a TEMPLATE answer naming a rule-less definition, is a
    ROW of that definition in the line's own paycheck: ``by_row`` remembers
    the row placed per ``(template_id, pay_period_id)``, so two lines in one
    paycheck share a row and two paychecks get one row each.  It was keyed on
    ``(name, category_id, pay_period_id)`` -> row, which converged within a
    press by a string compare and across statements by nothing.

    **Scoped to ONE REQUEST, and that scope is the design rather than a
    limitation.**  The cross-STATEMENT half is the definition itself: the
    merchant's answer NAMES it after the first mint, and
    :func:`~._placement._template_placement` finds or places its row in any
    later paycheck.  Only the within-one-press half needs a write-side
    registry at all, because at render time the definition this press is
    about to mint does not yet exist for any rule to name.

    **A refused item leaves nothing here, and the CALLER is what makes that
    true.**  :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed` remembers after the act that made
    it has RETURNED, so a creation rolled back inside its own SAVEPOINT
    (ruling **R-FZ**) leaves no entry pointing at a row that no longer exists.
    A first implementation remembered inside the create door, one line above
    the refusal that kills the item -- and the very next line of the sweep
    then looked up an id the rollback had taken, and died on ``NoneType``.
    The registry cannot be written where the write is not yet known to have
    survived.

    carries its own posting day and is its own cash movement.

    * a container this act CREATED closes on the day the bank took the money it
      holds;
    * a container an EARLIER LINE OF THIS SAME PRESS created closes on the
      LATEST of those days.  Measured before this arm existed: two lines in one
      pay period submitted 01-05 then 01-09 left the envelope recording that it
      closed on **2024-01-05 while holding `$45.00` the bank did not take until
      01-09** -- and submitting them the other way round recorded 01-09, so the
      close day was whichever line happened to be filed first.  No figure moved
      (each purchase carries its own posting day, so the envelope's own cash leg
      is `0.00` either way), but a row may not record closing before money it
      holds.  **The LATEST is this arc's own rule for a group** -- a match's day
      is ``max(posted_on)`` over its lines (``MatchDays.of``) -- applied to the
      group a press files;
    * a container that ALREADY EXISTED keeps its own close day.  That is the
      shipped behaviour of the destination arm and it is deliberate: that row's
      close is a record the OWNER made, and re-dating it would edit their
      record rather than complete this press's own.

    Args:
        creation: What the owner submitted, which says which arm this is.

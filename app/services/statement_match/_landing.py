"""Where a match's difference LANDS, and what that member is then worth.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gq``: a pure move out of :mod:`._variance`, which
stood at 999 of pylint's 1000-line ceiling with plan step
``bank_import:X-gp`` still to write the consent gate's new argument into it.
Nothing here changed in the move -- the three definitions are transplanted
byte for byte.

**THE ARGUMENT FOR ALL OF THIS IS STILL** :mod:`._variance`'s **module
docstring, and deliberately so.**  That prose is ONE argument -- what happens
to a difference: who may decide where it lands, and what gets written when
nobody does -- and it runs straight across the seam this split cuts on: six of
its eleven paragraphs describe the refusals and this landing at once.  Dividing
it would have meant rewriting it, and a rewritten paragraph is one a reviewer
cannot grade as unchanged.  So it was left whole, in the file that still holds
the refusals and :func:`~._variance.mint`.  **That leaves a design record
partly describing code it no longer sits beside**, which is a real cost and is
recorded as finding **bank_import:BI-484** rather than accepted silently.

What this module holds is the DECIDING half:

* :class:`DifferenceLanding` -- which member of a match absorbs the
  difference, and what the bank says that member is worth;
* :func:`corrected_figure` -- what that member's own column must then store,
  which differs on a purchase and on a transaction carrying entries;
* ``_named_member`` -- reading the owner's stated attribution off a
  submission, which is the only input this derivation is given.

The refusals that GATE these, and the :func:`~._variance.mint` that closes a
gap nobody attributed, stay in :mod:`._variance`.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in,
frozen dataclasses out, no Flask import.  :func:`corrected_figure` READS --
one ``Transaction`` and its off-statement sum -- and writes nothing.

class DifferenceLanding:
    """Where a match's difference goes, decided ONCE for the whole act.

    **ONE rule, and it is the whole of ruling R-GD(a)'s determinacy:** the
    difference this door would write goes to the member the match ATTRIBUTES it
    to, and where it attributes it to none it becomes **R-FN**'s ordinary
    accepted row (:func:`~._variance.mint`).  A match attributes it

    * to its SOLE row where it names one -- nothing has to be apportioned, so
      the bank's figure is simply an assertion about that row;
    * to the member the OWNER NAMED where it names several (plan step
      ``bank_import:X-gj-3a``);
    * to NONE where it names several and the owner named no member, which is
      every match this screen submitted before that step.

    **The middle arm is the step's whole change, and it does not weaken the
    argument above it.**  :mod:`._variance`'s opening paragraph -- *three rows
    summing to one deposit, five cents short, is not five cents of error in one
    of them* -- is about what the DOOR can DERIVE, and it stands unamended:
    nothing here apportions and nothing here guesses.  What is new is that the
    owner may SAY which member the bank varied, and a stated attribution is a
    decision rather than a derivation.  The developer ruled the control on
    2026-09-01 and ruled its DEFAULT with it (**R-IU**): the panel offers NO
    pre-selected member.

    **The ruling that settles the default is R-HX, not R-FZ(b)**, and the
    difference is the one **R-HS** carves out in its own words: R-FZ(b) banned
    the ARBITRARY default and *never meant a suggestion the app can justify*,
    so citing it for a DERIVED pick would be citing the half that was carved
    away.  R-HX is on point -- *an unmatched inflow is not pre-filled until a
    rule can justify the destination*, and *being the ONLY act is not what
    R-HS means by justified*.  The app is not without a CANDIDATE here:
    ``salary_profiles.template_id`` names the member whose figure is computed
    (:meth:`~app.services.income_service.SalaryPricing._breakdown_by_period`
    returns the paycheck's ``net_pay`` for it and ``template.default_amount``
    for every other) so *which member rounds* is a stored fact.  What it lacks
    is a JUSTIFICATION: `salary:N-391` reads *NOT yet attributed*, and none is
    coming -- ``bank_import:X-gj-3b`` was WITHDRAWN (**R-JJ**) and
    ``salary:R18`` dissolves the question: one deposit will name ONE row.

    **It is a GENERALISATION of ``bank_cash_for`` rather than a second arm
    beside it, and the algebra is why that matters.**  That function answered
    :attr:`~._sides.MatchSides.bank` for a lone row and ``None`` otherwise.
    The figure here is *what the bank moved, less what the OTHER members come
    to* -- and for a lone row there are no others, so the subtrahend is zero
    and the answer IS the bank total, identically.  A version that had kept
    the old function and added an ``elif`` for the named member would have
    been two spellings of one money rule, which is this arc's own root cause 1.

    **It is stated as a subtraction from the BANK and not as an addition to
    the ROW, and the difference is a rounding one.**  ``row.cash_amount +
    sides.difference`` is the same value in exact arithmetic and is what a
    first version of this class computed -- but ``sides.app`` is ROUNDED
    (:class:`~._sides.MatchSides`), so on a row whose cash carried sub-cent
    places that spelling would return the bank's figure plus that row's own
    rounding error, where this one returns the bank's figure exactly.  Every
    figure the app can produce today descends from ``Numeric(12, 2)``, so the
    two agree on all of them; ``MatchSides``' own docstring is what says a
    derived price with more places is expressible, and a money rule that is
    right only until then is not right.

    **The two remedies stay EXCLUSIVE by construction rather than by care.**
    :attr:`bank_cash` is a figure exactly where a member absorbs the gap and
    ``None`` exactly where none does, so correcting a row and minting a member
    for the same difference is unrepresentable -- the property
    :func:`~._accept.record_match` used to get from ``bank_cash_for`` and which
    a first version of that step lost by gating the mint on consent alone.

    **The measured population is finding salary:N-391.**  On a production
    clone carrying the developer's own 376 recorded lines, seven payroll
    deposits are 2-3 app rows summing ``$0.04``-``$0.06`` under what the
    employer paid, ``+$0.35`` across the span.  Before this step the only thing
    this door could do with that gap was mint seven uncategorized rows.

    **WHICH member it belongs to is NOT established, and this class does not
    claim it is.**  An earlier draft of this paragraph said every cent of it
    belongs to the salary row; `N-391`'s own last sentence says the opposite
    -- *NOT yet attributed: a `$0.04` error in any of the 12 hand-entered
    deductions reproduces the same net, and the gross is n=1*.  What was
    measured on 2026-09-01 is narrower and is about the GROSS: the app derives
    a per-paycheck gross by dividing ``salary_profiles.annual_salary``
    (`$91,675.00` / 26 = `$3,525.96`) where the owner's stub states
    `$3,526.00`, and re-running all seven paychecks through
    :func:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck` at the stub's
    figure collapses the span from ``+$0.35`` to ``+$0.07``.  That is a fact
    about the derivation and not a per-member attribution: the bank shows ONE
    deposit, so no per-member bank figure exists to compare an allowance
    against, and *the allowances match exactly* is ``bank less allowances =
    salary`` restated.  The gross half is ``salary:X-av``'s, which
    `N-391` already names.

    Attributes:
        on_row: The member the difference is written to, or ``None`` where it
            has none and :func:`~._variance.mint` is what closes the gap.  It is one of
            the very rows handed to :meth:`of`, so the caller cannot be given
            a row the act does not name.
        bank_cash: What the bank states :attr:`on_row` is worth, signed on
            :attr:`~._offers.CandidateRow.cash_amount`'s own convention, or
            ``None`` beside a ``None`` row.  **The CASH figure and not the
            figure to store**: :func:`corrected_figure` is what inverts it into
            what the row's own column holds, which differs on a purchase and on
            a transaction carrying entries.

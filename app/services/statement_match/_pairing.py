"""How far a bank line sits from a row the app holds, and whether they may pair.

**The day rules, stated ONCE for both tiers of the matcher** (plan step
``bank_import:X-f6d-1``).  :mod:`._propose` scores an EXACT figure and
:mod:`._near` scores a near one, and both have to answer the same two questions
about a candidate pair: *may these be paired at all*, and *how far apart does
the app believe they are*.  This module owns both answers.

**Splitting them out is this package's own lesson rather than a tidy-up.**  Two
spellings of one bound is what finding **N-322** was, and the two passes over
one bucketing before it; the module docstrings on either side of this one say
in as many words that a bound only one pass applies *is not a bound, it is a
disagreement*.  A second tier that re-derived the day window would be exactly
that, one measurement later.

Services-boundary discipline: plain data in, plain data out.

    """Return whether *row* may be paired with *line* at all.

    Two independent tests, and both are about THIS pair rather than about the
    row: a distance the owner would recognise, and a pairing the write door can
    actually carry out.

    **The distance is measured from the row's WINDOW**
    (:attr:`~._offers.CandidateRow.expected_window`) -- the days the app
    believes that money moved between -- widened by :data:`DAY_WINDOW` at each
    end.  A row with no window at all is refused rather than admitted: see the
    comment on that branch.  For most settled rows and for an unsettled purchase
    the window is one day, so the test is exactly the
    ``abs(anchor - posted_on) <= DAY_WINDOW`` it has always been; for an
    unsettled TRANSACTION it is that row's whole pay period, which is the whole
    of what the app asserts about when the money moves; and for a PURCHASE the
    reconcile panel ticked it is the span from its purchase day to the day the
    balance was asserted, which is the whole of what the app knows there.

    **An unsettled transaction had NO distance test at all until plan step
    X-f6a-3c, and that was finding N-312.**  The reasoning was that the bank is
    the only evidence such a row has, so there is nothing to be far from -- true
    of the row's CASH clock and false of the row, which is budgeted in a
    paycheck.  Measured on the developer's own clone: removing the settled
    partner from an amount group makes **44 of the statement's own lines** pair
    with a projection budgeted 48 to 148 days later, the worst a 2026-04-01
    line taking a mortgage transfer budgeted 2026-08-27.  The arm the old
    reasoning protected is untouched: every one of the 51 rows a proposal
    settles today is a PURCHASE, and 0 proposals name an unsettled transaction
    on either the first pass or the second.  **That census predates the NEAR
    tier** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-1``), which is a third pass and does
    propose one: the count is a measurement of the two passes it was taken
    over, not a property of this module.

    **The FLOOR, and forgetting one was a real defect.**  A purchase cannot
    reach the bank before it was made, so ``entry_service.update_entry``'s
    ``_reject_settled_before_purchase`` refuses that pairing at the door -- and
    a proposer blind to ``purchased_on`` renders an Accept button that can
    never succeed.  Measured on the developer's own clone: 23 (line, undated
    purchase) pairs where the line posted BEFORE the purchase was made.  Found
    by adversarial security review 2026-08-17.

    **What plan step X-f6a-3a changed is that the floor is now SATISFIABLE
    rather than merely refusing**, because a match may move the purchase day
    (ruling **R-FW**).  The pairing is legal when the app's own purchase day
    already sits on or before the bank's, OR when the day the match would write
    does -- so a purchase the owner recorded days late is a CORRECTION to offer
    instead of a line the review screen leaves looking unexplained.  It is the
    same measurement that forced the ruling: on the developer's own statement
    14 unexplained lines worth `$1,028.66` are an exact amount at the same
    merchant as an unmatched purchase, refused only because the recorded
    purchase day was 1 to 5 days after the bank posted it -- and the door
    X-f6a-3b builds would have offered to record every one of them a SECOND
    time.

    **The floor is asked of the LINE, not of a bare day, and that is the bug
    fix rather than a signature tidy-up.**  ``_one_to_one`` kept a row that was
    legal against ANY line sharing its amount, and :func:`_assign`'s undated arm
    then paired it with whichever line was free -- so a per-GROUP survival test
    stood in for a per-PAIR legality test.  Measured on the developer's own
    clone at HEAD: 3 offered proposals whose Accept could never succeed, the
    worst pairing a line posted 2026-06-01 with a purchase made 2026-07-27.

    Args:
        row: The candidate.
        line: The bank line it would be paired with.

"""What a stated rule comes to for ONE unexplained bank line.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3d``.  :mod:`._rules` holds the ANSWER -- where
the owner has said a merchant's spending goes -- and this holds what that
answer means for one line of one statement, which is a different question with
a different shape: an answer is period-independent by construction, and a
placement is the one budget line in the one pay period that line falls in.

**Every way an answer can fail to reach a line is REPORTED, never substituted
for.**  A template that generated no offerable row in this period, two rows
where one was expected, a category since archived: each is a
:attr:`PlacementKind.UNRESOLVED` carrying the sentence that says which.
Substituting -- falling back to a new envelope when the named one is missing --
is how a suggestion becomes a guess, and it would file money somewhere the
owner never named.

**Nothing here writes anything**, which is the property the whole step rests
on: a placement is rendered BESIDE a line's destination select, never into it,
and the select still opens on *leave this line alone* (ruling **R-FZ**).

    * ``RECORD_IN`` -- an existing budget line in this line's own pay period;
    * ``PLACE`` -- a row of a RULE-LESS definition the line's recording would
      PLACE in its own pay period, where that paycheck holds none (plan step
      ``balance:X-bi-7b`` leaf 7b-3, ruling **R-BAL24**): a TEMPLATE answer
      naming a definition that generates nothing -- a grid one-off's, or the
      one a NEW-ENVELOPE answer minted the first time it fired -- reaches
      every later paycheck this way, one placed row per paycheck through
      ``one_off.place_row_of``.  Before this kind existed such an answer
      resolved UNRESOLVED everywhere but the one paycheck holding a row
      (``from_scratch_architecture.md`` 10.6-D's regression);
    * ``CREATE_NEW`` -- an envelope this line's recording would create, and
      only where this period holds NO placed envelope of that name and
      category (finding **N-327**, developer ruling 2026-08-20): a rule-less
      definition minted through ``one_off.place_one_off`` with its first
      row, after which the merchant's answer NAMES that definition and every
      later line takes ``PLACE`` (finding **N-328**).  Within one press the
      lines of one answer converge on the definition the first of them
      minted (:class:`~._container.MintedEnvelopes`: a ``Lowe's -> a new
      "Home Improvement"`` answer applied to the developer's own statement
      once made **4 envelopes across 3 pay periods** in one press).  **It is
      still a SUGGESTION and never a substitution**: the placement is
      PRINTED beside the line's own destination select, which still opens on
      *leave this line alone*, so the owner may pick another;
    * ``UNRESOLVED`` -- a rule exists and does not reach this line, with the
      reason it does not.  **Reported rather than substituted for**: the
      obvious substitution, falling back to a new envelope when the named
      template has no row in this period, would file money somewhere the owner
      never named.

    **There was a fourth, ``NOT_A_PURCHASE``, and ruling R-GJ deleted it** (plan
    step ``bank_import:X-ga``).  *Never a purchase* stopped being something a
    rule PLACES and became something that BARS: it is a
    :class:`~._bars.CreationBar` now, resolved before a destination is looked
    for, so the line never reaches this module at all.  Keeping a kind here for
    it would be a second statement of a refusal -- and what that second

            ``None``.  **That is the whole reason the merchant is a nullable
            fact** (plan step X-f6a-3d): a reader that fell back to the

        view: What the owner has said and what it can resolve against

        offered: The destinations open to this line, in its own pay period.
        period_id: The line's own paycheck (``budget.pay_periods.id``), which
            the PLACE arm needs to ask whether the definition already holds a
            row there; ``None`` for a line before the books opened, which no
            arm places into.  Keyword-only and defaulted for the callers that
            resolve against *offered* alone.

    Returns:
        The :class:`Placement`, or ``None`` when nothing is placed -- which is
        three facts this function deliberately does not distinguish, because
        none of them puts anything beside the line's own control: the owner has
        not stated a rule for this merchant, they have stated *ask me every
        time*, or they have stated *never a purchase*.  **The last is a BAR,
        not a placement** (ruling **R-GJ**): it is answered by

        :func:`~._leftovers._creatable_lines` asks first, so a line carrying that
        answer never reaches here at all.

    for by name and everything else returns ``None``.  It used to be written

    :class:`Placement`'s twin for the other direction, and deliberately a
    SEPARATE value rather than a fourth :class:`PlacementKind`: the two resolve
    against different things and produce different acts.  An outflow placement
    picks from the pass's own offer set of budget lines and yields a
    :class:`~._creations.PurchaseCreation`; this names a CATEGORY -- which is
    not a container, reserves nothing and is not drawn from any offer set --
    and yields a :class:`~._creations.IncomeCreation`.  A value carrying both
    shapes would be one Jinja condition away from rendering a destination
    select beside a deposit, which is exactly what ruling **bank_import:R-GW**
    states the emptiness of :class:`~._leftovers.RecordableInflow` to prevent.

    **There is no CREATE_NEW arm and there cannot be one.**  An income row is
    filed against nothing, so there is no container for an answer to mint --

        merchant: The line's merchant, which is the rule's key.

        category: What that category is CALLED, carried beside its id for the
            reason :attr:`~._rules.StandingRule.merchant` is: the card's
            sentence prints it, and the read that resolved the answer already
            had it (:attr:`~._rules.RuleView.active_categories`).  Reading it
            back separately would be a redundant producer call, and worse, the

            the answer it describes.

            line, or ``None`` when it does.  **Exactly one of the two is set**,
            which is :attr:`~._bars.BarredLine.answer_door`'s own idiom: a

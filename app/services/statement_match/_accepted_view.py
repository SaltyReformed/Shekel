"""What an ACCEPTED match looks like now, and whether it still holds.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-2`` built this reader; plan step
``bank_import:X-f6a-3d`` moved it out of :mod:`._reads`, which had grown past
the 1,000-line module ceiling.  The boundary is a real one rather than a place
to cut: :mod:`._reads` answers *what is there to do*, and this answers *what
was already done and does it still say what it said*.

**They are read by two different SCREENS since plan step
``bank_import:X-gf-2``** (ruling **bank_import:R-GX**), which is the same
boundary made visible: the review screen is the exception queue, and every act
already accepted is on the register, where it is found and undone.  So this
module no longer runs inside the review pass at all -- it was valuing 221 acts
on the developer's own account on every render of a page whose panel for them
he was not reading -- and it needs no :class:`~._scope.ReviewScope`, no
calendar and no candidate derivation of its own.

**Agreement is DERIVED, never stored** (:mod:`app.models.statement_match`).
Nothing records the day a match asserted -- that is ``max(posted_on)`` over its
bank lines, and each member row carries it in its own ``settled_on``.  So an
owner who later moves a day by hand puts the group out of agreement with the
bank, and :attr:`AcceptedGroup.agrees` SHOWS it rather than a release nobody
can see: the repair door finding **N-302** says a refusal owes.

Services-boundary discipline: reads only, plain data in, frozen dataclasses
out, no Flask import.

    one the app performed for them.  Dropping a field to meet a limit is what

    facts a template reads separately and one condition each, so a nested value

            records.  It is empty for every match between rows that already
            existed, which is most of them.
        applied_by_rule: Whether a STANDING RULE performed this act rather than
            a person ticking it (ruling **R-GT**, plan step
            ``bank_import:X-ge``).  **The column exists so that this can be
            SHOWN**: it is the one fact about an act that is not derivable from
            what the act names, which is R-GT's own argument for storing it and
            against a foreign key to the rule row -- and a fact written and
            never seen is the shape this arc keeps finding.  It is what lets
            the import receipt list exactly the acts nobody pressed, and what
            lets the register say which of the accepted matches the owner
            agreed to line by line.  **No default, which is the discipline every
            other link in this chain keeps**: ``ReviewedBatch.consent``,
            ``create_purchase_from_line``'s keyword-only flag and the column
            itself all refuse one, because the two values are *the owner agreed
            to this* and *the app did it on their behalf* -- and a default
            claims the first by omission.  It defaulted to ``False`` until an
            adversarial security review named it, 2026-08-26: the DISPLAY half
            of a consent fact may no more assume consent than the writing half.
        created_every_row: Whether EVERY row this act names is one it made,
            which is the difference between ADD and MATCH in the Reconcile
            screen's vocabulary (ruling **bank_import:R-HP**, plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-1a``).  A MATCH says *this line IS a row the
            books already hold*, so an act naming even one row it did not
            create is one.
            **It is NOT "did this act create anything"**, and that reading is
            wrong on the case this whole arc exists for: an unbalanced group
            mints ruling **R-FN**'s residual row and records it as a creation
            (:func:`~._accept.accept_match`), so a payroll MATCH -- seven
            deposits and `$18,132.63` on the developer's own account -- creates
            something while matching rows that already existed, and would have
            been captioned *Added*.  Reproduced by adversarial review
            2026-08-29 against ``test_residual``'s own fixture.
            **Nor is it "did it create a PURCHASE"**: ruling **R-GW**'s income
            door creates an uncategorized TRANSACTION and is an ADD, which a
            kind test would call a match.  What separates them is whether
            anything PRE-EXISTED, and that is what this asks.
        agrees: Whether the match still HOLDS -- which is three questions, not
            one, and a first draft asked only the first.  Every row still
            carries ``posts_on``; the act still names at least one row; and the
            rows still SUM to what the bank stated.  The second and third are
            what a CASCADE breaks: deleting a purchase or destroying a pay
            period removes that member silently, and a day-only test then
            reports a group that explains less than it claims -- or, when every
            row goes, nothing at all -- as still agreeing with the bank.  False
            is not a corruption; it means the match wants re-reviewing, and the
            screen offers it for exactly that.

    release control exists to free them -- and RAISING would take the screen
    down for the account with no in-app repair, which is finding **N-302**'s
    shape.

    **The IDS are what the alarm is FOR, and a first version dropped them.**
    The Python skip it replaced logged ``match_id``, and its own comment called
    that "naming the row to delete"; carrying only a count told an operator how
    many rows they could not find.  Adversarial review measured the loss

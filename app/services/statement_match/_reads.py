"""What the review screen shows: unmatched lines, proposals, and what agrees.

Read-only, and separate from :mod:`._accept` for the reason every package here
splits that way: the write door and the reader answer different questions, and
a reader living inside the door is a reader nobody can call without one.

**It reports three things a bound would otherwise hide**, because a screen that
lists what it could explain and says nothing about what it could not reads as
a clean sweep:

* lines that predate the owner's pay calendar, which nothing can ever match --
  130 of the developer's own 378 lines, and listing them beside genuine
  failures would bury the ones worth acting on;
* days too crowded to search for groups, as the SEARCH reports them
  (:attr:`~._propose.ProposedMatches.crowded_days`);
* matches whose rows no longer carry the day the bank stated, which is what a
  later hand edit produces and what makes a match re-reviewable rather than
  quietly stale -- reported by :mod:`._accepted_view` on the REGISTER since
  plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-2``, this screen having stopped listing
  accepted acts at all (ruling **bank_import:R-GX**).

    splitting.  Nine are cards the owner reads and acts in;
    :attr:`declined_lines` annotates two of them; and
    :attr:`account_payments` is neither -- it is a pass-level MERCHANT set,
    carried here because the question it answers is asked of every CARD and
    cannot be answered from any of the lists (its own entry below argues the
    placement).  *This said NINE over eight cards, and was already wrong by
    one at plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c``, which added ``answered_never``
    without re-counting; ``X-gj-4b`` added the eleventh.*  Re-counted off the
    field block rather than incremented, which is the discipline
    :class:`~._leftovers.Leftovers` states for its own count and this file did
    not keep.  Named by adversarial review 2026-09-04.  It was TEN until
    plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-2`` took the accepted matches off this screen
    (ruling **bank_import:R-GX**): they are not a decision anyone is making,
    and folding them cost this pass a valuation of all 221 acts on the
    developer's own account to render a panel he was not reading.

    **``bank_import:X-gf-3a`` did NOT make it ten.**  A first version added a
    ``rule_verdicts`` map keyed by line id; adversarial design review
    2026-08-27 pointed out that a per-LINE fact belongs on the per-line value,
    where :attr:`~._leftovers.CreatableLine.placement` and
    :attr:`~._leftovers.RecordableInflow.withheld` already are -- which also
    deleted the map, its accessor, and a ``field(default_factory=dict)`` whose
    default meant *not asked yet* in a value whose own docstring forbade that
    reading.

    The obvious way to satisfy the limit is to fold ``declined_lines``
    back into :attr:`bounds`, where it lived until plan step
    ``bank_import:X-f6d-3`` -- and that is exactly what the step measured to be
    wrong, because a bound reported in a panel names no line and cannot be
    acted on.  The other obvious way is to fold :attr:`parked` back into
    :attr:`creatable` and let a Jinja condition withhold the control, and that
    is what ruling **R-GJ** exists because of: a sentence saying *nothing here
    records it* sat over a working select for as long as those two were one
    list.  ``AcceptedMatch`` carries the same disable for the same reason, and
    its docstring says what dropping a field to meet a limit costs: the receipt
    said *"Nothing moved."* over a rewritten figure.

    Attributes:
        proposals: What the app believes goes with what, best first.
        unmatched: Bank lines inside the pay calendar that no proposal
            explains, ascending by day.
        unmatched_rows: The app's OWN rows that no proposal explains, over the
            span the recorded statements cover -- ruling **R-FP**'s other side,
            and the more valuable half for a budget: a row the bank never
            showed *and would have shown separately* is a payment the records
            claim happened and the bank did not make.  **That qualifier is
            load-bearing and was missing until plan step ``bank_import:X-gc``**;
            :attr:`~._offers.CandidateRow.not_shown_alone` is where the screen
            withdraws the claim for a row whose money the bank accounts for
            through some other row, and the membership of this list is
            deliberately unchanged by it -- it is also the hand-build form's
            row-picker, and ruling **R-GJ** leaves the group match as a parked
            card payment's only arm.  They are
            :class:`~._offers.CandidateRow` values rather than a type of their
            own; a second record carrying the same five fields was reported by
            pylint's cross-file ``duplicate-code`` and was exactly rule 13's
            speculative shape.
        creatable: The unmatched lines that may become a PURCHASE, each with
            the budget lines it could become one against
            (:class:`CreatableLine`).  A SUBSET
            of ``unmatched`` rather than a partition of it, and deliberately:
            the same line is offered to the hand-build form as something to
            GROUP and to the create door as something to RECORD, because those
            are different acts on the same fact and the owner is the one who
            knows which it is.  **INFLOWS ARE PRESENT, and which ones is
            :func:`~._rules.pipeline_for`'s answer rather than the sign's**
            (ruling **bank_import:R-II**, plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-2``).  This held only outflows while
            ``ck_transaction_entries_positive_amount`` said ``amount > 0`` and
            the create door refused every inflow by sign; that CHECK is
            ``amount <> 0`` now, so a merchant credit IS a purchase the table
            can hold -- a NEGATIVE one, against the container that merchant's
            rule names -- and the inflows here are exactly the ones a container
            answer claims.  Every other inflow is in
            :attr:`recordable_inflows`.  **A line that ruling R-GJ bars is not
            here** -- it is in :attr:`parked` or :attr:`answered_never` -- so
            this list is exactly the lines a create control may be rendered
            for, and the screen cannot render one for a line the door would
            refuse.  *That was one list until plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-4c``*, and both halves are still out of this
            one: which of the two a barred line is in decides where it
            RENDERS, never whether the create door would take it.
        parked: The unmatched lines a source files as paying an account the
            owner holds, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (it said OUTFLOW until plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``; see :attr:`~._leftovers.Leftovers.parked`,
            which this is assigned from verbatim), with
            the reason each may not become a purchase
            (:class:`~._bars.BarredLine`, ruling **R-GJ**).  They are still in
            ``unmatched``, so the group-match arm the ruling leaves open is
            reached exactly as it was.

            **It held BOTH of ruling R-GJ's arms until plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-4c``** -- a merchant the owner answered *never a
            purchase* and a merchant a source files as an account payment --
            and ruling **bank_import:R-JH** separated them, because only the
            second is a disposition.  A line carrying BOTH bars is here, since
            the money did move between two of the owner's accounts whatever
            else they said about it.
        answered_never: The unmatched lines barred ONLY by the owner's own
            *never a purchase* answer (:class:`~._bars.BarredLine`, ruling
            **bank_import:R-JH**, plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c``).  **Inbox
            work, and that is the whole of the ruling**: the answer shuts the
            ADD door and claims nothing about what the line IS, since a
            paycheck is not a purchase either -- so these are rendered under
            *Nothing suggested* keeping MATCH, rather than filed as though the
            owner had disposed of them.  A SUBSET of ``unmatched`` like the
            two lists above it.
        recordable_inflows: The unmatched INFLOW lines, each with the period
            that would hold it (:class:`RecordableInflow`, ruling **bank_import:R-GW**).
            The mirror of ``creatable`` on the direction that had no door at
            all until plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-1``: no inflow could be a
            purchase then, and a match needs an app
            row on the other side -- which left `$58.87` of the developer's own
            deposits, in eight lines, with no act the screen could offer.
            Like ``creatable`` this is a SUBSET of ``unmatched`` and not a
            partition: the same deposit is offered here as something to RECORD
            and in the hand-build form as something to MATCH, because those are
            different acts on one fact.  **An inflow CAN be barred out of it, and
            that is a behaviour change plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``
            states rather than leaves to be discovered.**  This read *nothing
            is barred out of it: neither arm has anything that could be true of
            money arriving* -- the argument ``bf500943`` measured FALSE for
            ``PAYS_AN_ACCOUNT_YOU_HOLD``, which is a claim about the MERCHANT.
            A credit from a card-payment merchant that ALSO carries a stored
            spending answer routes to PURCHASE, meets
            :func:`~._bars.reject_barred_line`, and is PARKED -- so it reaches
            neither this list nor a create control, and the hand-build match is
            its only act.  **That is the intended outcome** (recording it as
            income is the double count against the card transfer ruling
            **R-GJ** exists to stop), and the sentence *the owner has an act
            for it either way* was false of exactly that line.  What leaves
            this list WITHOUT being barred is a deposit a container answer
            claims: it is a refund, it is in ``creatable``, and that is a
            routing decision.
        merchants: The queue's rule control
            (:class:`~._section.MerchantSection`) -- the merchants this pass
            has an unexplained outflow for and the owner has NEVER answered
            about, which is a decision they owe.  **It counts EVERY list a
            line can land in**, because a merchant a source files as an account
            payment is barred for want of an answer and this is the control
            that gives one.  *It said* ``parked`` *beside* ``creatable`` *until
            plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c``*, when ``answered_never`` became
            a third: those lines were inside ``parked`` and therefore already
            counted, so naming two lists after the split would have narrowed
            this control silently.  An ANSWERED merchant is on the register
            instead (ruling **bank_import:R-GX**).
        bounds: What this pass did NOT look at (:class:`ReviewBounds`).
        account_payments: The merchant row ids this account's sources file as a
            payment to an account the owner holds, carried up from
            :attr:`~._leftovers.Leftovers.account_payments` verbatim (plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-4b``).  **It is the only fact here that is about
            every card rather than about one of the lists**, and that is why it
            is a set on the pass instead of a field on a line value: ruling
            **bank_import:R-JI** shuts SKIP for these merchants, and the lines
            it has to shut it for include the ones a tier PROPOSED a match for,
            which are in :attr:`proposals` and in none of the barred lists.
            :func:`~._cards._offers` is the one reader, and this is the one
            statement of the argument it points at.
            **The obvious narrower spelling is wrong**:
            :attr:`~._bars.BarredLine.also_pays_an_account` answers this for
            the two BARRED lists only, and a line a tier has proposed a match
            for never meets :meth:`~._bars.CreationBars.bar_for` at all.
            **ONE of the two populations it was widened for is gone, and the
            set stays because the OTHER one is untouched** (plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gm``).  The argument for reaching past the barred
            lists was that a line a tier PROPOSED a match for is in
            :attr:`proposals` and in neither of them.  An OUTFLOW from such a
            merchant can no longer be proposed --
            :func:`~._undisposed.inbox_partition` takes the holding states off
            the proposer (ruling **R-HQ**) -- but an INFLOW from one still can:
            a deposit no container answer claims routes to INCOME
            (:func:`~._rules.pipeline_for`), so it is not a holding state, it
            is in the inbox, and it reaches this pass as a
            :class:`~._leftovers.RecordableInflow` rather than a
            :class:`~._bars.BarredLine`.  :attr:`~._bars.BarredLine
            .also_pays_an_account` cannot answer for such a line AT ALL, which
            is why the narrower spelling is still wrong and this set is still
            the one :func:`~._cards._offers` asks.  It is also the DOOR's own
            set (:func:`~._vocabulary.account_payment_merchants`, read once per
            pass), so a card builder added later shuts the verb by asking the
            question :func:`~._skipping.skip_line` asks rather than by
            remembering a list.  Shutting the verb anywhere but on this set
            renders a control the door refuses, which is ruling **R-GJ**'s
            `$7,412.94` shape one verb over.
            *An earlier draft of this paragraph cited :mod:`._bars`' seven Van
            Loan lines as the populated case and that was the WRONG SET* --
            that module records four of them as already MATCHED and three as
            falling before the pay calendar opens, and a matched line is out of
            the pass altogether.  Named by adversarial review 2026-09-04.
            **A line naming NO merchant is never shut**, and that is
            :meth:`~._bars.CreationBars.bar_for`'s own totality rather than a
            guard restated by a reader:
            :func:`~._vocabulary.account_payment_merchants` filters
            ``merchant_id.isnot(None)``, so ``None`` is absent from this set
            and falls through to the same answer a branch for it would give.
            The DOOR asks the same question the same way.
            **No default**, for :attr:`~._bars.BarredLine.also_pays_an_account`'s
            own reason: an empty set means *nothing is barred*, which is the
            value that reads as safe and would open a verb the door refuses.
        declined_lines: WHAT THIS PASS CONSIDERED and would not conclude
            about, by line id, in the words of the tier that declined
            (:attr:`~._propose.ProposedMatches.declined_lines`).  It carried
            only the near tier's CONTEST until plan step
            ``bank_import:X-ge-1``; it now carries every rejection a tier makes
            after admitting the figure, because a bound a tier applies and does
            not report is one nothing can see.

            **It rides on the SET rather than in the bounds panel** (plan step
            ``bank_import:X-f6d-3``).  It was a count under *What this page did
            not look at*, which named no line -- so the owner was told that
            somewhere among a hundred lines one had a near candidate, with no

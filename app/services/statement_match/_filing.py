"""What a standing rule files by itself, for the lines ONE import just recorded.

Ruling **R-GH**, plan step ``bank_import:X-ge``.  **It MOVES MONEY, and it is
the only door in the app that moves money without a press.**

**Why it exists, in the developer's own words (2026-08-24):** "In a perfect
world the app would hold every real transaction the bank saw and automatically
assign it to the appropriate line item in the budget."  Ruling **R-FP** made
that unreachable *by ruling* rather than by limitation -- every act was a
proposal needing a tick, so Food Lion's fortieth swipe needed the same human
act as its first.  **R-GH splits consent by ACT CLASS**: creating a row from a
NEW bank swipe under a rule the owner stated is consented to once, when they
state the rule; modifying a row they made by hand -- re-date, re-price, settle,
group-match -- keeps its tick, which is :mod:`._accept`'s door and not this
one.

**What it acts on is the SCREEN's own creatable set, not a second derivation.**
:func:`~._reads.review_set` decides which lines a create control may be
rendered for, and every clause of that decision is a refusal this door would
otherwise have to restate: the pay calendar, finding **N-325**'s impossible
days, ruling **R-GJ**'s bars, and *no proposal explains this line*.  A rule
files a subset of that set and can never widen it, which is the property
:mod:`._rules` states for a placement one tier down.

**Three narrowings turn "the screen would offer this" into "a rule may file
it", and each is a measured hazard rather than caution.**

* **NEW swipe lines only** (**R-GI**).  A line names the import that FIRST
  recorded it, so ``import_id`` IS the freshness fact and no second column is
  needed.  It is also exactly right about the case that looks like an
  exception: :func:`~app.services.statement_import._record._absorb_gained_facts`
  fills a recorded line's ``merchant_id`` when a later export names one the
  first adapter could not, so such a line becomes rule-keyed at a LATER import
  while still naming the earlier one -- and it is not a new swipe, so it is not
  filed.  A re-import of an overlapping span records no fresh line and
  therefore files nothing, which is what makes this door idempotent for free.
* **The pass must have finished LOOKING** (:meth:`~._reads.ReviewSet
  .search_gap_for`, developer ruling 2026-08-26).  Membership of ``creatable``
  is a set defined by subtraction, and under a human tick the person reading
  the screen is the check.  There is no person here.
* **A destination this pass PROPOSES as a whole-row match is not open to a
  rule.**  Ruling **R-FZ(d)** ruled that where two TICKED items collide over
  one envelope the PROPOSAL wins, because it explains money the records already
  hold; auto-apply inverts the order -- it files at import and the proposal is
  ticked afterwards -- so the same rule has to be applied from the other side.
  Measured on the developer's own 378 recorded lines: **0** of the 80 lines a
  rule would file aim at an envelope a proposal names directly, and 33 aim at
  one holding a purchase a proposal names, which is the safe shape (two acts,
  neither naming both a parent and its own child).

**What it does NOT narrow, and both were ruled by the developer on measurement
(2026-08-26).**  A rule files into an envelope that has already CLOSED -- 33 of
those 80 lines, `$911.10`, against **0** into an envelope still open, because
the owner settles ahead of the bank -- which ruling **R-FX** already admits on
exactly the terms :func:`~._candidates.destinations_for` enforces: the row's
recorded figure IS its purchases, so a new one raises that cost by exactly the
figure the bank showed and carries the bank's own posting day.  And a *new
envelope* answer files too, minting the container, because the alternative
leaves the developer's single largest rule (Amazon, 26 lines, `$1,323.06`)
needing a manual act on every import until ``bank_import:X-f6c`` gives that
answer a template identity.

**It DERIVES and does not write.**  What it produces is the same
:class:`~._creations.PurchaseCreation` the review screen's own destination
select submits, and :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed` is what performs them --
one door, one failure policy, one savepoint per item, one receipt shape.  The
consent is the batch's (:class:`~._batch.Consent`), so nothing here decides
what reaches ``applied_by_rule``.

    """File the lines *import_id* recorded that a standing rule answers for.

    Ruling **R-GH**, plan step ``bank_import:X-ge``.  **It MOVES MONEY**: every
    line it files becomes a purchase the app did not have, in the destination
    the owner's own rule names, dated the day the bank posted it.

    Does NOT commit -- the route owns the unit of work, exactly as
    :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed` beneath it does.  So an import whose filing
    dies outside a designed refusal records no line either, which is what makes
    the receipt's account of what happened true rather than reassuring.

    **The SCOPE is the route's, for the reason** :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed`
    **states**: only a route builds a read pass.  It is derived AFTER the
    import has staged its lines, because a pass derived before them cannot see
    the swipes this door exists to file.

    **Its two setup failures are deliberately NOT caught here.**
    ``ReviewScope.build`` raises ``PayCalendarError`` when the owner has
    paydays and no resolvable cadence, and ``BaselineMissingError`` when no
    scenario can price a row; both fail the whole request loud, which rolls the
    import back with it.  That is the right answer rather than a gap: in either
    state every money surface in the app is already unreachable, ruling
    **R-BW** has an application-level handler that renders the repair page for
    the second, and recording a statement is IDEMPOTENT -- so the owner fixes
    the calendar and imports the same file again at no cost.  Catching them
    would trade a loud, repairable failure for a silently half-run import.

    Args:
        scope: The pass's derived offer set (:class:`~._scope.ReviewScope`),
            built by the route after the import staged its lines.
        import_id: The import that JUST RAN, and the caller's contract is
            that it did.  Ruling **R-GI** reaches NEW swipe lines only, and an
            id is a number any caller can supply: handing this an OLDER
            import's id would file lines that have been sitting in the
            exception queue since, which is the backfill that ruling forbids.
            **Taking the ``ImportOutcome`` instead would make that structural
            and CANNOT be done** -- ``statement_import`` imports this package
            (``_reads`` and ``_undo`` take ``removals_by_match``), so the edge
            back is a cycle, which is the same wall
            :mod:`._vocabulary` documents for the source adapter's own
            knowledge.  Named by adversarial security review 2026-08-26; the
            one caller is the import route, which passes the outcome it has
            just received.
            Its account is *scope*'s: an import belongs to one account
            (``fk_bank_statement_lines_import_account``) and so does a pass,
            and taking the account from the SCOPE is what stops one door's
            import being filed against another door's account -- a foreign
            ``import_id`` yields no line at all rather than a foreign one.

    Returns:
        The :class:`RuleFiling`.

    Raises:
        PostingError: From a ledger reconcile, on a broken invariant.  Fails
            the whole request loud rather than being reported as one line's
            refusal -- :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed`'s own rule, unchanged
            because this door is the same door.

"""What a standing rule comes to for one line, and what the screen says.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-3a``, finding **N-359**.  :mod:`._placement`
answers *where does this merchant's money go* for one line; :mod:`._filing` is
the door that files it without a press; and this answers the question BETWEEN
them, which neither owned: *would this pass file this line under that rule, and
if not, why not*.

**It exists because that verdict had exactly one reader and no surface.**
``_rule_filings`` decided it inside the import request and reported it on
:class:`~._filing.RuleFiling`, whose only rendering is the import's FLASH.  The
review screen then re-rendered the same lines and could say nothing about it --
so a line the owner's own rule was supposed to have handled sat in the queue
looking like one nobody had answered for.  The screen could not restate the
rule either: a second spelling of *would this have filed* is a second place for
it to be wrong, on the one door in the app that moves money with no press.  So
the verdict is derived ONCE, here, and both read it (finding **N-359**).

**The SENTENCE the screen prints is derived here too, whole**, and that is not
convenience.  A first version of this step set two facts in Jinja and picked
between them with ``{% if %}``/``{% elif %}`` -- the shape
:attr:`~._bars.ParkedLine.reason` and :attr:`~._leftovers.RecordableInflow
.withheld` exist to refuse, stated in as many words in the very template it was
written into: *a template restating a partition is a second place for it to be
wrong*.  Found by adversarial design review 2026-08-27.

**Two reasons withhold a filing, and they are not the same kind of fact.**

* **The pass did not finish LOOKING** (:func:`~._gaps.search_gap`, developer
  ruling 2026-08-26).  Membership of :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.creatable` is a
  set defined by SUBTRACTION -- no proposal claimed the line -- and that is two
  facts wearing one name: *the pass looked and there is nothing*, and *the pass
  threw the only candidate away*.  Under a human tick the person reading the
  screen is the check; ruling **R-GH**'s door has no person, so it withholds.
* **A proposal on this pass explains the rule's destination on its own**
  (ruling **R-FZ(d)**, inverted).  That ruling settled that where two TICKED
  items collide over one envelope the PROPOSAL wins; auto-apply files at import
  and the proposal is ticked afterwards, so the same rule is applied from the
  other side.

**What that second collision actually costs, measured rather than asserted.**
It does NOT double-count, in either order, and a first version of this header
said it did -- inheriting the wording ``X-ge`` gave the receipt.  Adversarial
financial review 2026-08-27 traced the arithmetic: a purchase created from a
bank line is born carrying the bank's posting day,
:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.posted_purchase_sum` counts exactly those, and
the cash leg is ``gross - off_statement_sum``.  Filing `X` into envelope `E`
raises both terms by `X` and leaves `E`'s cash leg **unchanged to the cent** --
so the books record `E` plus the new purchase against the bank's two lines, and
no dollar is counted twice.

**What it costs instead is the MATCH.**  The created purchase is a match member
by ``transaction_entry_id``, so
:func:`~._accept._reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase` refuses any later act
naming `E` as a whole -- the proposal beside it becomes impossible to accept,
and the bank line that proposal explained stays unexplained until the purchase
is undone.  That is the sentence both registers carry now.

**The same trace REFUTED this module's first stated backstop.**  It claimed the
create-then-accept order is refused because :func:`~._candidates.repriced`
re-prices every named row and finding **N-336** rejects an item whose row has
moved.  N-336 cannot fire here: the price is invariant by the arithmetic above,
and ``_container._close_day`` returns ``None`` on the existing-envelope arm so
``version_id`` does not move either -- and those two coordinates are exactly
what :meth:`~._submission.ReviewedRow.disagrees_with` compares.  The order IS
refused, by ``_reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase``'s second arm.  The
invariant held; the reason given for it was one unread call chain from false.

**So this module adds a SENTENCE and not a refusal**, which is the consent
split ruling **R-GH** made: the screen says what the automatic door saw, and
the person decides.

#: **Neither names a POSITION**, and the first one did until plan step
#: ``bank_import:X-gf-3b`` (ruling **bank_import:R-HC**): it read *"Check the

#: of its own.  A service sentence naming where something sits on a page is
#: coupled to a layout the service cannot see -- EIGHT owner-visible sentences
#: carried that coupling and all eight broke in one step, THREE of them derived

#: (adversarial design review 2026-08-28).  What the sentence
#: states is the ACT; the row renders the link, which is the one fact a service
#: may not build (:attr:`~._bars.ParkedLine.answer_door` sets the precedent).
#:
#: **It said *as new spending* until plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``**, and
#: ruling **bank_import:R-II** is what made that false: a merchant credit a
#: rule files as a NEGATIVE purchase reaches this pipeline
#: (:func:`~._verdict.ruled`), and calling a refund *new spending* to the owner
#: is the mis-describing sentence over a working control that ruling **R-GJ**
#: measured `$7,412.94` going through.  The verb is direction-neutral now,
#: because the ACT is: matching a line against rows already held is the same
#: remedy whichever way its money went.
_LOOK_FIRST = (
    "Match it against rows you already hold before recording it."
)
#: What to do about a line whose period already holds money that arrived.
#: Beside :data:`_LOOK_FIRST` and :data:`_ACCEPT_FIRST` because the three are

#:
#: **PUBLIC where its two siblings are private**, and the asymmetry is the

    **One value with two readers**, which is the whole of finding **N-359**'s

    and the review screen prints
    :attr:`~._leftovers.CreatableLine.warning`, composed by :func:`ruled` from
    this same decision.  A line no rule reaches has no verdict at all rather
    than an empty one -- the absence is the answer, and a value meaning *no
    rule* would be a second spelling of ``None`` a reader could forget to
    branch on.

            select submits.  Never ``None``: a placement that names no
            destination reaches no line, so it produces no verdict.
        withheld: Why this pass would NOT perform it, or ``None`` when nothing
            stands in its way.  **This is the RECEIPT's register** -- the
            sentence :class:`~._filing.WithheldLine` carries after an import --
            and the screen's is :attr:`~._leftovers.CreatableLine.warning`,
            which wraps this one rather than restating it.
            **A withheld verdict is not a refusal**: the create door is still
            open for this line and its select still renders, because ruling

    That ruling settles a collision between two TICKED items -- an envelope a
    proposal names is also a destination a recorded line was aimed at -- in the
    proposal's favour, because a proposal explains money the records already
    hold against a line the bank showed, which can be re-aimed next pass.
    Auto-apply files BEFORE the proposal is ticked, so the same answer has to be
    reached by withholding rather than by ordering.

    **Only rows the proposal names WHOLE.**  A proposal naming a PURCHASE
    inside an envelope is not a claim on the envelope: the two acts name
    disjoint subjects, each match's members still sum to its own lines, and
    ``_accept._reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase`` refuses only the pairing
    where ONE act names both.  Measured on the developer's own statement: 33 of

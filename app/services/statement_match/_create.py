"""The door that turns a bank line the app has no row for INTO a purchase.

Ruling **R-FS**'s third shape, plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3b``.  **It MOVES
MONEY**: a line recorded here becomes a cash movement the app did not have,
dated the day the bank posted it.

**The card-swipe lines an envelope aggregates have no counterpart to match**,
because the app records a period's groceries as one envelope and the bank
records every swipe.  Measured on the developer's own 2026-08-16 statement
against a 2026-08-18 production clone: after every proposal the matcher offers,
**91 unmatched outflows** remain -- 74 of them card swipes worth `$3,383.49`,
the case R-FS names -- and they are not the same money at a different grain: in
period 9 the app holds 8 debit purchases, the matcher pairs ALL 8, and the bank
then shows 12 more the app has nothing for.  Over the assertion span the app's
own records state `+$3,000.46` of movement where the bank states `+$558.28`.

**Every bank line becomes a PURCHASE, and this door never creates a bare
transaction.**  A purchase is the app's record of one payment; a transaction is
a budget line that reserves.  Recording a payment as a budget line would
collapse the two facts a purchase keeps apart, and it would give a later
statement line nowhere to go.  So the only question the owner answers is which
budget line CONTAINS it, and there are exactly two answers:

* an existing envelope, from the set :func:`~._candidates.destinations_for` offers;
* a NEW envelope this door creates in the line's own pay period, named from
  what the bank called it.

**The second arm always creates an ENVELOPE rather than a plain row**, so an
unbudgeted expense gets a container that can take later purchases too, and so
the app's shape does not depend on whether a category happened to be budgeted.

**Nothing here decides which** (ruling **R-FP**): the owner picks, and the
picking is what makes this a review rather than an import that rewrites a
budget.

**...and since plan step ``bank_import:X-ge`` the owner may have picked
EARLIER** (ruling **R-GH**).  Consent splits by ACT CLASS: a standing merchant
rule is the owner saying where that merchant's money goes, so an import may
open this door for a NEW swipe line without a second act -- and every act that
would MODIFY a row they made by hand still needs its tick, which is
:func:`~._accept.accept_match`'s door and not this one.  Nothing about the
purchase changes: the destination is resolved from the same offer set, the
figure and both days come from the same recorded line, and the act records
WHICH consent it had (``applied_by_rule``) so an owner reading the receipt can
tell the two apart and undo either.

**...but some lines have no answer at all, and this door refuses them** (ruling
**R-GJ**, plan step ``bank_import:X-ga``).  A merchant the owner has answered
*never a purchase* for, and one a SOURCE files as a payment to a credit card
that they have not answered for, are BARRED: no destination makes such a line
legal, because the money it moved is already in the budget in another shape.
The screen renders no create control for one, on EITHER of the two lists the
pass files a barred line in (:attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.parked` and
``answered_never``, split at plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c``), and
:func:`~._bars.reject_barred_line` refuses it at this door, which is the half a
crafted body or a stale page reaches.  **This door is blind to which list**,
because it reads :meth:`~._bars.CreationBars.bar_for` rather than the screen's
partition -- so the split moved no refusal.  Measured on the developer's own
dev database: nine Capital One ACH payments became `$7,412.94` of purchases in
eight new envelopes, beside 22 ``CC Payback`` rows RECORDING `$6,286.46` of the
same card's spending, in one pass, past a warning paragraph.  **Those rows are
still standing**; closing this door repairs nothing behind it, which is
``bank_import:X-gb``'s.

    """Return the submitted line, refusing one this door may not record.

    **The account scope and the already-matched refusal are
    :func:`~._resolve.load_lines`', not restated here** (plan step
    ``bank_import:X-f6a-3c-2``).  This door records a match like every other,
    so *is this line on this account, and has something already claimed it* has
    to be ONE answer; it carried a second copy of both while that function was
    private, which is two places for a refusal to stop firing.  The
    already-matched half matters here for the same reason it does there:
    ``uq_statement_match_members_line`` refuses the second act anyway, but it
    arrives as an ``IntegrityError`` after a purchase has been created, which
    reaches the user as "Something went wrong" and logs a traceback for an
    ordinary stale page.

    The third refusal IS this door's own, because it is about what THIS DOOR
    builds rather than about matching: the line must be one
    :func:`~._rules.pipeline_for` routes to
    :attr:`~._rules.LinePipeline.PURCHASE`.

    **It was *the line must be money LEAVING*, and neither half of that is the
    rule any more** (ruling **bank_import:R-II**, plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-2b``).  The REASON was the schema -- *a purchase is an
    expense (``ck_transaction_entries_positive_amount``), so a deposit or a
    refund cannot become one* -- and that CHECK is ``amount <> 0`` now, so a
    refund IS a purchase the table can hold: a negative one, against the
    envelope its merchant rule names.  The TEST was the sign, and plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-2`` built the act that files such a line, so the sign
    no longer decides: an inflow whose merchant carries a container answer is a
    refund this door owns, and every other inflow is
    :func:`~._income.record_income_from_line`'s.  Asking the dispatcher is what
    keeps this refusal and the screen's own partition one answer.

    **What is still refused, and why it is not a guess** -- an inflow the
    owner has said NOTHING about.  Filing one against a budget line would name
    a container they never gave, which is what ruling **R-HX** refused.  16 of
    the developer's own unexplained lines are inflows, so this is the ordinary
    shape rather than a crafted request.

    **What it SENDS the owner to changed at ruling bank_import:R-GW**, and the sentence
    with it.  It used to say *match it to the row it belongs to instead*,
    which was the only other act there was -- and for an inflow no row
    explains, it was advice to do something impossible: eight of the
    developer's own deposits are smaller than the smallest row the match form
    offers.  :func:`~._income.record_income_from_line` is the other half now,
    so the refusal names both and the two doors are total over the lines the
    schema allows (``ck_bank_statement_lines_amount_real_nonzero``).

"""What a match IS, as values -- the shapes every other module here passes.

Ruling **R-FS** gives a match three shapes and this module gives them one
type.  A :class:`MatchProposal` is a candidate the app OFFERS -- and that is
now the whole of what lives here.

**What the owner sends BACK lives in** :mod:`._submission` **since plan step
``bank_import:X-f6d-3``**, and the seam is the DIRECTION rather than the line
count.  The distinction was always this module's own -- *a proposal carries
what the screen needs to explain itself, and a submission carries only ids* --
and finding **N-336** is where the two stopped fitting in one file: a
submission now carries the STATE each row was reviewed in, which is a value
read off a hostile request body, and nothing on this side ever is.

**What a CREATION is lives in** :mod:`._creations` **since plan step
``bank_import:X-f6d-1``**, and the seam is the subject rather than the line
count: this module is about a correspondence between what the bank recorded
and what the app already holds, and those five names are about a budget row
that does not exist yet.  Five of the six modules that import them import
this one too, and that is the honest statement: the seam is the
SUBJECT, not the import graph -- a review screen is about both.

**What the app HOLDS lives in** :mod:`._subjects` **since plan step
``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1``** (this module crossed the 1,000-line bound,
ruling **balance:R-IR**), on the same argument: a :class:`CandidateRow` is
one of the app's three matchable subjects as the app holds it, and knows no
bank line; what stays here is the bank's side (:class:`BankLine`) and the
correspondence itself (:class:`MatchDays`, :class:`MatchProposal`).

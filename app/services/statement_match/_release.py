"""The UNDO: what releasing a match takes back, and the ONE derivation of it.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6f``, developer ruling **R-GG** (2026-08-24).  Split
out of :mod:`._accept` because the two are opposite acts on one relation and
because that module stood at 996 of this project's 1,000-line bound -- but the
seam is a subject rather than a line count, and it is the same seam
:mod:`._variance` was cut on: everything here reads what an act CREATED, and
nothing in :mod:`._accept` does.

**Deleting the record does NOT put the days back, and that is the honest
direction.**  A settle day is what the app knows about when money moved, and
the bank is still the best evidence it has; reverting one because the owner
unlinked a record would throw away a correction in order to tidy a relation.
What the release restores is the QUESTION -- the bank lines become unexplained
again and the rows become matchable again -- which is the repair door finding
**N-302** says a refusal owes.

**A row the act CREATED is the exception, and it is the same argument rather
than a departure from it.**  A settle day is a fact about money that moved and
survives the unlinking; a row that exists only because the act recorded it
states nothing once the act is withdrawn.  Keeping it is not conservative, it
double-counts.  Measured through these doors: one `-$57.96` bank line recorded,
released and recorded again moved the balance **`-$115.92`** and left two
purchases and two budget lines for one swipe (findings **N-333**, **N-340**).

**A SUBJECT and a CONTAINER are removed on different terms, and the difference
is MEMBERSHIP** (ruling **R-GG**).

* A creation the act also NAMES is what the act is ABOUT -- a group's
  residual, a purchase recorded from a bank line.  It is removed, and a row
  the owner has EDITED since REFUSES the undo instead: deleting that would
  throw away their record in order to tidy a relation, which is the direction
  this module already refuses to go for a settle day.
* A creation the act does NOT name is a CONTAINER -- the budget line the
  create-a-purchase arm may mint to hold its purchase.  It is removed only
  when nothing is left in it and nothing has touched it since, and otherwise
  it simply stays.  **It never refuses**, because the container is not what
  the act is about and leaving one standing costs nothing: it budgets `0.00`,
  holds nothing, and books nothing (an empty ``purchases`` settlement has no
  covering movement, so ``covered_cash_leg`` reads ``0.00``), so it is an
  ordinary row the owner
  deletes in one click if they want it gone.

**THREE things refuse an undo, and all THREE are asked before anything is
written -- including the refusals of the doors this one calls.**  A created
SUBJECT the owner has edited since; one the door that removes it would
refuse anyway; and one the amount model can no longer price, which refuses
because a door that cannot say what removing a row would take out of the
books may not remove it.  A CONTAINER refuses nothing.  ``entry_service`` admits removing a
purchase from a settled row only where the removal cannot change what that
row's own close booked, and a container this act created can be put beyond
that afterwards.  Measured on this step's own first build: the panel offered
*"Undo removes 1 row"* over an archived container and the release then raised
with the act already deleted from the session.  :func:`_subject_removal` asks
that door's question (``entry_service.removal_refusal``) rather than
discovering the answer halfway through, which is what keeps this module's
promise a property rather than a hope.

**The measured consequence of that asymmetry, stated rather than discovered.**
One press can file several lines into one envelope (11 of the 47 on the
developer's own dev database hold 2-4 purchases), and each later line RE-CLOSES
that envelope on its own posting day -- which moves the container's revision
past what the creating act recorded.  So an envelope a multi-line press built
survives every undo, empty, and the owner removes it themselves.  The
alternative was to guess which writes count as "untouched", which is exactly
the guess ``created_version_id`` exists to avoid.

**The undo reaches only what was recorded AFTER the creations relation
existed.**  An act carries a creation record because the door that made the row
wrote one, so the 230 acts already on the developer's database carry none and
this door removes nothing for them.  A backfill was considered and is measured
unsafe: the tightest available signature claims **62 purchases the app already
had** alongside the 103 the pass created, because an accepted match writes the
same facts onto a row it merely re-dates.  Those rows are reached instead
through ``entry_service``, whose removal rule the same step corrected at the
root -- measured, 103 admitted and 0 refused.

**What the screen shows and what the door does are ONE derivation**
(:func:`planned_removals`), which is the shape :func:`~._preview
.preview_hand_build` already has one door over: the register's accepted
list prints what an Undo would remove, the confirm dialog carries the same
figure, and the door then removes exactly that.  Two derivations would let the
screen promise one thing and the button do another.

            **It is what the ownership of a DESTRUCTION rests on.**  The delete
            path's transaction arm did ``db.session.get(Transaction, row_id)``
            and handed the result to ``transaction_service.delete_transaction``,
            whose signature says *the user the caller proved owns it* and which
            re-checks ``user_id`` nowhere -- so a row this function destroys
            was owned only by derivation from where its id came from.  That is
            the argument finding **N-358** was raised to stop accepting, one

            doors is what made this one invisible.

    """Remove one row an act created, through the door that owns its table.

    A PURCHASE goes through ``entry_service.delete_entry``, which is the one
    door for removing one: it reverses the purchase's own dated cash leg while
    ``journal_entries.transaction_entry_id`` still links it, re-derives the
    envelope's CC Payback, and reconciles the family.  **Its settled-parent
    refusal is what plan step X-f6f corrected at the root** rather than
    bypassed here: removing a purchase that carries a posting day cannot change
    what a ``purchases``-basis close booked, measured `0.00` -> `0.00` on the
    envelope's own leg with only the purchase's own `$57.96` leg reversed.  A
    matcher that deleted around that refusal would have been a second
    purchase-delete door restating a money rule.

    A TRANSACTION -- a group's residual, or an emptied container -- goes
    through ``transaction_service.delete_transaction``, for exactly the reason
    the purchase arm goes through ``entry_service``.  **It SPELLED that verb's
    sequence itself until plan step ``bank_import:X-gb``**, saying it "takes
    the transaction delete sequence WHOLE" beside the delete route that spelled
    the same four steps -- and each step's ORDER is a money rule, so two copies
    was two places for that order to drift.  Neither created kind RECURS (a
    residual names no template; a created envelope is a rule-less definition's
    placed row since leaf 7b-3 of ``balance:X-bi-7b``), so the verb's hard
    delete runs, disposing of the definition with its LAST row (step 5).

    **Its match WITHDRAWAL finds nothing of THIS act's on this path, which is
    why calling the shared verb is safe here.**  A row is named through its
    one payment (``uq_transaction_entries_one_settlement_record``), a movement
    belongs to at most one act (``uq_statement_match_members_entry``), and
    :func:`release_match` has already deleted and flushed the only act that
    could name this row's payment.  **Nor can it take ANOTHER act**, though
    the verb takes every movement of the row it removes off the books and a
    purchase under a created row could be named by a second act -- measured
    through the doors for ledger row **CC-359** (plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-3``, 2026-09-22), and NOT by the row's revision
    counter, which a purchase added underneath does not move (``2 -> 2`` on a
    minted envelope, ``3 -> 3`` on a reverted residual):

    * a created CONTAINER holding a purchase this undo is not removing is
      never removed at all (:func:`_container_survives`' content arm), so the
      verb never reaches it -- the undo takes back its own purchase and the
      other act stands;
    * a created SUBJECT row -- a group's residual -- cannot take a purchase
      while it stands as created: its definition tracks none, and settled
      over its covering movement it is refused
      (``entry_service._refusals._reject_settled_addition``).  A purchase
      reaches it only after a revert, and the revert moves its revision, so
      the undo refuses it as edited since; and a second act could not name
      that purchase anyway, the double-count refusal
      (:func:`~._accept._reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase`) holding it
      while this act names the row;
    * a created INCOME row takes no purchase at all (``create_entry``'s
      expense-only guard).

    ``TestReleasingAnActDoesNotWithdrawTwice`` grades the container case, and
    its first version released an act that had CREATED nothing and so never
    reached this function at all.

    **It removes the row it was HANDED, and does not look one up** (finding
    **N-371**, plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-3a``).  The transaction arm did
    ``db.session.get(Transaction, row.row_id)``, so the ownership of a row this
    function DESTROYS rested on where its id had come from -- and
    ``transaction_service.delete_transaction`` re-checked ``user_id`` nowhere,
    its own signature saying *the user the caller proved owns it*.  **That door
    reconciles its ``owner_id`` against the row since plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C13-b``** (finding **N-373**), so the argument below is no
    longer the only thing holding this path -- but it is still the reason this
    function passes an INSTANCE, because a door that refuses is not a door that
    should be reached.  The id is
    gone from that path now: :attr:`PlannedRemoval.subject` is the instance
    :func:`planned_removals` already walked to off a
    :class:`~app.models.statement_match.StatementMatch` filtered on ``user_id``
    and ``account_id``, so no id re-enters a query between the ownership check
    and the delete.

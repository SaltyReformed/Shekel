    :class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` or a
    :class:`~app.models.transaction_entry.TransactionEntry` -- and WHOSE
    RECORD the candidate's figure, clock and settle door are.  The first two
    kinds agree on both: a PURCHASE is an entry stating its own figure on its
    own day, settled by the entry editor; a TRANSACTION is a row stating its
    figure over its pay period, settled by its status verb.  A SETTLEMENT
    is an ENTRY (the covering movement the status seam writes for a settled
    row, ``transaction_entries.covers_settlement``) whose figure, clock and
    door are its ROW's: the member names the movement, on the account the
    money moved through; the price is the row's record; the window is the
    row's paycheck; a match dates it by re-settling the row.

    **The MOVEMENT is the subject of every settled match** (ruling
    **R-CC43**, developer 2026-09-21): a settled row is offered as its
    covering movement on whichever account that movement is on, a Projected
    row as itself, and the member an accepted match records names the
    movement the settle wrote -- never the row.  Through plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-5-3`` a settled row was offered as a TRANSACTION on its
    own account and priced by its movement there, which left a bill charged
    to the card (its movement on the card, its row on checking) with no
    subject on either screen: the card's row-member key
    (``fk_statement_match_members_transaction_account``, dropped with its
    column at plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-2``) refused a row on another
    account, and checking's feed never shows the money.

    It describes ONE row drawn from either of two tables, for six consumers
    that each read a different subset: the proposer reads the amount, the days

    reads the days, the screen reads the label and the kind, the accept door
    reads the kind, the id and the routing links, the unmatched-rows panel

    the figure and the revision together.  ``TransferSpec`` carries the same
    disable for the same reason.  Two fields were MERGED rather than disabled around:
    ``earliest_day`` and ``expected_on`` were one fact for the only kind that
    has both -- and ``expected_on`` is a PROPERTY now, derived from the two
    facts it was a copy of.

    Attributes:
        kind: Which of the three subjects it is (:class:`RowKind`): the
            table :attr:`row_id` indexes, and whose record the figure, the
            clock and the door are.
        row_id: Its primary key within that table -- the movement's for a
            SETTLEMENT, whose row is :attr:`transaction_id`.
        label: What to call it on screen.
        cash_amount: Its SIGNED cash effect on this account -- positive INTO,
            the same convention ``bank_statement_lines.amount`` uses, so the
            comparison is a subtraction rather than a sign negotiation.
        settled_on: The day the app currently records the money as having
            moved, or ``None`` for a row that has not been settled at all.
        is_settled: Whether the row is already in the settled band.  A match
            SETTLES the first and CORRECTS the second, and which of the two a
            proposal would do is the one thing a reviewer most needs told.
        states_own_figure: Whether this row's amount is a fact about THIS row
            rather than about some other one.  ``False`` for the two shapes
            ``transaction_service`` publishes a predicate for -- an ENVELOPE
            whose figure is its purchases (``settles_from_entries``) and a CC
            PAYBACK whose figure is the card spend it repays
            (``repays_card_spend``) -- and ``True`` for every purchase, which
            stores its own.

            **It is CARRIED rather than re-asked, because two modules need one
            answer** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-1``).  The accept door has
            always asked it, to refuse a correction the next sibling write
            would silently revert (finding **N-252**); the PROPOSER now needs
            the same fact, because a near miss it offers on such a row is an
            Accept button that can never succeed -- and the proposer is pure,
            with no session to ask.  Carrying it is the shape
            :attr:`settle_day_basis` beside it took for the same reason: a
            fact the row states once, read by whoever needs it, rather than
            two derivations that can disagree.  See
            :attr:`figure_is_correctable`, which is the question those two
            modules actually ask.
        transfer_id: The parent transfer when this row is a shadow leg, else
            ``None``.  Carried because a shadow settles through
            ``transfer_service`` and not through the transaction verb, and a
            writer that had to re-derive that would be a second place for the
            partition to be stated.
        parent_id: The envelope a PURCHASE belongs to, or the row a
            SETTLEMENT is the payment of, else ``None`` -- a transaction IS a
            parent and names no other.  Carried so the proposer can decline
            to offer a group holding an envelope AND a purchase inside it,
            which the accept door always refuses because the envelope's
            figure already covers its own purchases; without it the screen
            renders an Accept button that can never succeed.  For a
            SETTLEMENT it is the row whose door a match dates it through
            (:attr:`transaction_id`).
        period: The paycheck this row is BUDGETED in, as the calendar derived
            it -- a transaction's own, and for a purchase its envelope's.
            **Carried for BOTH kinds since plan step ``bank_import:X-gz``**
            (ruling **R-BI9**): the MATCH pane prints every row's budgeted
            placement, and a purchase's was on no field at all -- the row
            carried its purchase day under the name ``expected_on`` and its
            envelope's period nowhere, though the constructor had it in hand.
            ``None`` only for a purchase whose period the calendar does not
            carry, which the offer set's own scope makes unreachable; a
            transaction's constructor declines such a row instead.
        purchased_on: The day a PURCHASE was made, which is its budget clock
            (``transaction_entries.purchased_on``, NOT NULL, ruling **R-FW**);
            ``None`` for a transaction and for a SETTLEMENT, whose only
            budget clock is the row's period -- a payment's stored purchase
            day IS its settle day (ruling **R-BAL39**), so it is not a
            second clock and the reader does not carry it as one.
            :attr:`expected_on` and :attr:`expected_through` are DERIVED from
            these two rather than stored beside them, so the span the matcher
            bounds by and the placement the pane prints are one fact.
        settle_day_basis: WHICH KIND of day :attr:`settled_on` is, read
            straight off ``settled_day_basis_id``
            (:class:`app.enums.SettledDayBasisEnum`): ``asserted`` is the
            reconcile panel's UPPER BOUND, ``observed`` is a day a bank
            statement showed, ``entered`` is the owner's own.  ``None`` exactly
            when :attr:`settled_on` is.  The three settle days this package can
            meet are not the same kind of fact and the difference decides a
            window, which is why the basis travels rather than being re-derived
            per asking site.  See :attr:`expected_window`.

            **It was a BOOLEAN derived from ``reconciled_by_id`` until plan step
            X-az** (finding **N-332**), and the column it was derived from
            answered a different question -- WHICH statement was seen to show
            this money, not what kind of day the row records.  The two agreed by
            coincidence of the writers that existed: exact over the panel's
            bound and the bank's observation, and BLIND to the third case, so a
            day the owner typed read as a day the bank had shown.  Carrying the
            basis is not a wider boolean, it is the fact itself.
        version_id: WHICH REVISION of the row this is -- its
            ``OptimisticLockMixin`` counter, read straight off the column.
            Both matchable tables carry one, and SQLAlchemy advances it on
            every ORM-emitted UPDATE of the row.  A SETTLEMENT carries the
            MOVEMENT's counter plus its ROW's
            (:func:`~._valuation.settlement_candidate`): the seam mirrors the
            row's assertion onto the movement, and the row's counter sees
            what the mirror does not (a reverted row moved to another
            paycheck, a rename); both only rise, so the sum rises on any
            change to either.

            **It is carried for the same reason** :attr:`states_own_figure`
            **is: a second module needs the fact and cannot ask for it.**  A
            review has two moments -- the screen states a correction, the owner
            presses Apply later -- and until plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-3``
            nothing compared the row the screen described with the row the door
            was about to write (finding **N-336**).
            :class:`~._submission.ReviewedRow` is where that comparison lives,
            and its docstring carries the measurement for why this coordinate
            and the figure are BOTH needed: neither one sees the other's
            writers.

        have no answer at all.

        * a row settled by an OBSERVED day is a point: that ``settled_on`` is
          the day a statement showed the money moving, and an observation beats
          a belief, so the projection is not consulted;
        * a PURCHASE settled by the RECONCILE PANEL spans ``purchased_on`` to
          ``settled_on``, because that day is a BOUND and not an observation --
          see the measurement below.  A BILL ticked the same way keeps its
          point for now, which the same passage explains;
        * a PURCHASE is a point at ``purchased_on``.  Every purchase has one
          -- ``transaction_entries.purchased_on`` is NOT NULL -- so "undated"
          is true of a purchase's CASH clock and false of the purchase.  Plan
          step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3a``, ruling **R-FW**;
        * a TRANSACTION is its PAY PERIOD, start to end.  Its ``expected_on``
          alone is a budgeting fact rather than an observation, so a rule
          reading it as a point would be claiming the app knows a day it does
          not; the period is the span the app actually asserts, and it is the
          whole of what it asserts.  A SETTLEMENT is its ROW's period on the
          same argument (plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1``): a payment's
          budget clock is the bill's paycheck, and the day it carries is the
          row's settle day mirrored, a point exactly when the row's was.

        **The bound this produces is CADENCE-RELATIVE, and saying so is part
        of stating it.**  The owner's cadence (a ``budget.pay_eras`` row's
        since plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-a``) is user-stated, a day count
        1..365 or a day of the month, so the days a line may be posted on and still
        claim a bill run to the period's length plus twice
        :data:`~._pairing.DAY_WINDOW`: 35 for a weekly owner, 42 for the
        biweekly one this was measured against, 58 monthly, and 393 at an
        annual cadence -- where it is barely a bound at all.  That is the
        honest consequence of bounding a row by what the app itself asserts: an
        owner who budgets in coarser blocks has asserted less about when the
        money moves, and inventing a tighter claim on their behalf is the
        substitution ruling **R-FW** rejected one clock over.  What keeps it
        safe at every cadence is that a proposal is reviewed before it commits
        (**R-FP**).

        **A TRANSACTION answered ``None`` here until plan step X-f6a-3c, and
        that was finding N-312: a bill the app has never marked as paid could
        be claimed by a bank line of any date whatever.**  Measured on the
        developer's own clone: 610 unsettled transactions, 600 of them
        projections dated past the statement's last day, and when the settled
        partner is removed from an amount group **44 of the statement's own
        lines immediately pair with a future projection** -- the worst a
        2026-04-01 line taking a mortgage transfer budgeted 2026-08-27, 148
        days later.  It never fired on the first import only because a settled
        row won every amount race; the second import is where the app's own
        rows have run out.  The earlier reasoning -- that bounding a bill would
        refuse the arm which settles a row nobody has marked as having happened
        -- was re-measured and does not hold: every one of the 51 rows that arm
        settles today is a PURCHASE, already bounded by its own day, and 0
        proposals name an unsettled transaction on either the first pass or the
        second.

        **An ASSERTED settle day is a BOUND, and reading it as a point made
        the matcher blind to the rows it most needed to see.**  The reconcile
        panel stamps the day the owner asserted the BALANCE for --
        ``reconcile_service._purchases.record_settled_days`` says so in as many
        words, *"``settled_on`` is an UPPER BOUND on the true posting day"* --
        while this property read every settle day as the day a statement
        showed.  Two packages, one column, two meanings.

        **The row now SAYS which it holds** (plan step X-az, finding **N-332**).
        This branch asked ``reconciled_by_id IS NOT NULL`` until then, which is
        a different question -- WHICH statement was seen to show this money --
        and it happened to answer the same way for the two writers it met.  It
        could not see the third: a day the owner typed carries no link, so it
        read as a bank observation and got a point.  ``settled_day_basis_id`` is
        the fact itself, and the branch names the member it is about.  Measured on the
        developer's own dev database 2026-08-21: all 61 reconciled purchases on
        Checking carry ``settled_on = 2026-08-18``, and **59 of them sit more
        than** :data:`~._pairing.DAY_WINDOW` **days after their purchase day**
        (worst: 128).  So a point at ``settled_on`` put them out of reach of
        their own bank lines, every such line read as unexplained, and the
        merchant rule offered to RECORD it -- **50 duplicate
        purchases worth `$3,590.00`**, among them a `$18.64` Food Lion the app
        already held on the bank's own day.  The remedy is to say what the app
        actually knows: the money moved between the day the row was budgeted
        for and the day the balance was asserted.

        **PURCHASES only, and that is a measured scope rather than a
        half-finished one** (developer decision 2026-08-22).  The panel stamps
        bills and transfer shadows identically, so the argument for widening
        them is the same -- but the EVIDENCE is not, and neither is the risk.
        ``budget.transactions`` carries **zero** reconciled rows today, so that
        arm would ship on argument alone; and a purchase's floor is a database
        fact (``ck_transaction_entries_settled_not_before_purchase``) while a
        bill's is its pay-period start, which this docstring calls a budgeting
        fact and refuses to read as a point *for that very reason*.  Widening a
        bill therefore opens a span with no floor and no cost signal: a
        `$1,910.95` payment budgeted 2026-01-05..01-18 and reconciled 08-18
        spans **225 days** in which :func:`~._pairing.days_outside` scores
        every day zero, so March, May and July lines of that same amount all
        become legal top-ranked pairings -- against a
        :data:`~._pairing.DAY_WINDOW` measured at 14 precisely so *"a monthly
        commitment cannot reach its neighbour"*.  Found by two independent

        **The bound is applied only when it TIGHTENS nothing away.**  A
        reconciled row whose ``expected_on`` falls after its ``settled_on``
        keeps the point: the panel would then be asserting the money moved
        before the app expected it, which bounds the span from ABOVE and says
        nothing about its floor, and inventing one would be the looser reading
        this property refuses everywhere else.  **That branch is UNREACHABLE
        through every door today** and is kept for the reason
        :func:`corrected_purchase_day` keeps its own: a total accessor states
        its impossible case rather than trusting the callers who make it so.
        ``ck_transaction_entries_settled_not_before_purchase`` makes
        ``purchased_on <= settled_on`` a database fact, so no purchase can
        reach it; a pay-period ``start_date`` edit in the ``pay_calendar`` arc
        is what would.

        Returns:
            ``(first, last)``, or ``None`` for a row the app can date no way at
            all -- which the proposer reads as NOT OFFERABLE rather than as
            unbounded (:func:`~._pairing.within_window`).  *A row stating only
            ``expected_on`` was read as a POINT until plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gz``*; both ends are derived from one fact now, so
            a half-stated window is unconstructible rather than tightened.

        **The one statement of "could the accept door take a variance here",
        and it exists because two modules ask it** (plan step
        ``bank_import:X-f6d-1``).  Ruling **R-GD(a)** made the bank's figure
        the record, so a one-to-one match whose sides disagree is RECORDED
        rather than refused -- but three row shapes are still refused, and a
        proposer blind to them would offer a near miss whose Accept can never
        succeed.  That is the shape this package has now named five times.

        The two facts it reads are the row's own, and each is stated once:

        * a transfer SHADOW cannot be corrected alone -- ``CLAUDE.md`` transfer
          invariant 3 holds its amount equal to its parent's, so the correction
          is to the TRANSFER.  :attr:`transfer_id` is that fact;
        * a row whose figure is not its own to state cannot be corrected at
          all, because the next sibling write reverts it (finding **N-252**).
          :attr:`states_own_figure` is that fact, and it is TWO published
          predicates rather than one -- see that attribute.

        **The refusals that are not here must not be**: a group's difference is
        the owner's to ACCEPT rather than any row's fault (nothing says WHICH
        member it belongs to), a sign disagreement is a fact about the PAIR,
        and a figure too large to store is a fact about the SUM.  Each belongs
        to :func:`~._variance.reject_unrecordable`, which owns everything
        about the two sides disagreeing.

        **A PURCHASE gets no branch of its own**, and the omission is
        deliberate: it stores its own figure and belongs to no transfer, so
        both terms already answer for it and a short-circuit on
        :attr:`kind` would be a second spelling that could disagree with the
        first.  Ruling **R-GE** -- a statement's evidence justifies correcting
        a SETTLED purchase's amount -- bounds that permission by the DOOR
        rather than by the row, so nothing here narrows it either.

        Returns:
            Whether :func:`~._variance._reject_uncorrectable_row` would let a
            differing figure through for this row.

        **Server-derived rather than a Jinja branch**, for the reason
        :attr:`~._bars.BarredLine.reason` is: a template restating a partition
        is a second place for it to be wrong, and this one is a claim about
        money -- the panel that reads it is asserting the bank failed to make a
        payment.  :attr:`app.services.statement_import.BankAnchor.unconfirmed`
        makes the same argument for the same kind of decision.

        **It reads** :attr:`states_own_figure` **and asks nothing else**, which
        is what keeps this a naming rather than a second derivation: that
        attribute is already carried and already published by
        ``transaction_service`` as two predicates.  It is a NARROWER question
        than that attribute answers, and the two are not the same fact -- a row
        whose amount is a fact about some OTHER row is one the bank accounts
        for through that other row, which is a SUFFICIENT reason for the bank
        never to show it alone and not a necessary one.

        **The converse is deliberately not claimed, and its gap is measured
        rather than assumed.**  A ``None`` here means the app cannot PROVE the
        bank would have shown this row separately, not that it would have.  Two
        shapes on the developer's own panel answer ``None`` and are arguably
        never their own line: the ``Phone Allowance`` and ``Health Insurance
        Allowance`` rows, which arrive inside one payroll deposit; and the 7
        envelope-tracked containers holding no entries (see
        :data:`NOT_SHOWN_ALONE`).  Neither carries a fact that says so, and the
        only predicates that would claim them -- a row-name list, or
        ``tracks_purchases`` -- would withdraw the alarm from rows the bank may
        really have failed to show.  **A predicate with no false positives and
        stated gaps is the honest shape here**; the alternative is the
        allowlist this project removes rather than writes.

            :data:`NOT_SHOWN_ALONE`, or ``None`` when the row states its own

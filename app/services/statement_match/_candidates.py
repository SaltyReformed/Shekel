"""Which of the app's rows a bank line could be or become, priced as it sees them.

The OFFER-SET half of the matcher.  Two questions, and they are here together
because they are the same question about two acts:

* :func:`candidates_for` -- *what has this account recorded that a statement
  could be showing*, over the four subjects the app holds a cash movement
  as (:class:`~._subjects.RowKind`), each priced with its SIGNED effect on the
  account so a comparison against ``bank_statement_lines.amount`` is a
  subtraction rather than a sign negotiation;
* :func:`~._destinations.destinations_for` -- *what budget line could a
  statement line BECOME a purchase against*, which is ruling **R-FS**'s third
  shape.  **In its own module since plan step ``balance:X-bi-7b``**, when
  this one crossed the 1,000-line bound (ruling **balance:R-IR**); the seam is
  this paragraph's, and the pass still derives the two together.

**Both are ONE scope shared by the screen that offers and the door that
writes**, which is the security property ``reconcile_service`` is built on: a
row these do not return cannot be reached by crafting a request, and a row they
do return cannot be refused by the write door for being out of scope.

**What is ALREADY SPOKEN FOR is not part of that scope, and separating the two
is what makes a batch safe** (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3c-2``).  These two
producers answer what an account COULD offer, which does not change while a
review pass runs; :func:`matched_subjects` answers what a match has already
claimed, which is exactly what the pass changes.  So the pass derives the offer
sets ONCE -- 3.6 s on the developer's own account -- and every act inside it
re-reads the claims for itself and narrows through :func:`unmatched_rows`
(and the destinations through ``_destinations.current_destinations``, which
re-asks the rows themselves).  Stating the narrowing once, outside the
producers, is what stops a snapshot offering a row an earlier item in the same
pass has just matched.

**The MOVEMENT is the subject of every settled match, and a row is a
candidate only while it is Projected** (plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1``,
ruling **R-CC43**, developer 2026-09-21).  A settled row's money is its
covering movement (ruling **R-BAL80**: the fold reads movements and no row),
so the movement is what a statement shows and what a match names -- on
WHICHEVER account the movement is on, which since ``credit_card:CC-5-3`` may
be another account than the row's (a bill on checking paid FROM the card
holds its movement on the card).  Offering the ROW for it, as this module did
through ``CC-5-3``, left such a bill with no subject anywhere: the member key
held a row member to the row's account, and checking's feed never shows the
money.  So :func:`_settlement_candidates` offers every covering movement on
the screen's account, :func:`_transaction_candidates` offers only the
Projected rows, and the two arms PARTITION on one predicate
(:func:`~._valuation.row_is_offered_here`): a Projected row is offered as itself on its
own account, and its kept movement -- a reverted row's, un-dated (ruling
**R-CC42**) -- is offered where the row is not.  **Since plan step
``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5`` (leaf 5c-2a, ruling R-CC137) a Projected row whose
kept payment is on ANOTHER account is not offered as itself either**: its
payment is the payment's account's subject (offered there while no act
names it), and the row's own screen names it instead
(:class:`~._subjects.HeldElsewhere`) unless it is worth ``0.00`` or cannot
be priced.  Two guards each keep a match from MOVING a payment between
accounts: withholding the row (no offered member reaches the settle with
a payment elsewhere), and :func:`~._moving._apply_day` naming no tender --
the structural one, which no test can grade while the first stands,
since nothing offered reaches it.  Withholding is also what makes a stale
page refused by name ("no longer available") rather than by the version
check, and a fresh accept never fail after its own settle.  Every accepted act therefore
names movements: the acts recorded before this step named rows until plan
step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-2`` re-keyed each onto its row's covering movement
and dropped the row column (ruling **R-CC45**, migration ``2eabfa596ee0``).

**A still-planned TRANSFER is offered as its LEG, and a paid one's side as its
leg's covering movement** (leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-1``, rulings **R-BAL87**,
**R-BAL106**, **R-BAL159**): :func:`_leg_candidates` offers each Projected
transfer's side on this account from ``transfer_legs.offerable_transfer_legs``
(keyed by the transfer on this screen), and :func:`_leg_settlement_candidates`
each paid side's movement from ``transfer_legs.recorded_transfer_legs`` -- the
owner, live, status and period clauses read off the TRANSFER in both.  The two
row arms EXCLUDE a transfer's shadow (``transfer_id IS NULL``): through leaf
``X-bi-6-4c-2`` a transfer was offered as its SHADOW row on this account, a
TRANSACTION, and its paid side as the shadow's movement joined to the shadow,
which ``X-bi-6-4d`` -- deleting the shadows -- would have left offering
nothing.  The two leg arms partition by the movement (ruling **R-BAL79**): a
side is a LEG while its transfer is Projected and its money has not moved,
and its DATED movement is the subject once it has (ruling **R-BAL80**).  Where
the row arms offer an un-dated kept movement (a row reverted after a
card-tendered settle, ruling **R-CC42**), the leg arms offer none: under a
Paid or Received transfer that record is a state no door writes, and an
Apply of it would date it on the wrong day
(:func:`~._valuation.leg_settlement_candidate`).

**What one candidate is WORTH is** :mod:`._valuation` **'s, in its own module
since plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1``** (this one crossed the 1,000-line
bound, ruling **balance:R-IR**; the seam is by subject, the one
:func:`~._valuation.repriced` had always stated -- the scope answers WHICH
rows an act may reach, the valuation what one is WORTH).  The five arms here
decide which rows exist and may be offered and build each through that
module's one constructor per kind (a LEG's in :mod:`._leg_valuation`); pricing
is the cash ledger's and the settle verbs', and is not restated in either.

    """What an account's accepted matches have already claimed.

    **The fact a review pass CHANGES, held apart from the facts it does not**
    (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3c-2``).  The offer sets beside it are
    derived once for a whole pass because nothing in the pass can add a row to
    them; this one is re-read by every act, because every act adds to it.

    It is also ONE query where there were two: :func:`candidates_for` read the
    account's members to exclude what it had claimed, and the accept door read
    them again to see an envelope whose purchase another match names.  Those
    are the same three sets, so a caller reads them once and threads them.

    **A row is CLAIMED through its PAYMENT** (plan steps
    ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1`` / ``CC-5-4a-2``, rulings **R-CC43**,
    **R-CC45**): every act names the row's covering movement rather than the
    row, so a Projected row whose kept movement an act still names is not
    offered again (the act shows on the register as no longer holding, with
    its Undo).  :attr:`transactions` holds the parents of the covering
    movements among :attr:`entries` -- the ACCOUNT's own acts, every set here
    the account's.  **It read the OWNER's acts until plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``** (leaf 5c-2b, finding **CC-385**): a payment
    may sit on another account than its row since ``credit_card:CC-5-3``, and
    a reverted card-paid bill was once offered on checking while the card's
    act named its payment.  Since leaf 5c-2a (ruling **R-CC137**) such a bill
    is withheld on Checking whether or not an act names its payment
    (:func:`_transaction_candidates`), so every row a screen offers has its
    payment, if any, on that screen's account, where the account's own acts
    claim it; and the two purchase readers the owner-wide reach still decided
    refused an envelope whose lump an act names after the envelope was set
    back to Projected -- falsely, because the revert keeps that lump UN-DATED
    and it counts nothing (ruling **R-CC141**, and the developer's
    2026-10-05 answer allowing the match).  :attr:`lines` and :attr:`entries`
    are the account's: a line belongs to one account, and a movement is
    offered only where it is.

    **A transfer's LEG is claimed through its movement too** (leaf
    ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-1``): :attr:`legs` holds the transfers whose side on
    THIS account an act names through that side's covering movement -- a
    reverted transfer's kept, un-dated one -- so its still-planned leg is not
    offered again while the act stands.  The account's own acts suffice, as
    they do for a row's claims since finding **CC-385**: a transfer's
    movement is always on its own side's account (``transfer_service`` names
    no tender), and the member key holds a member to the act's account.

    **The CALENDAR is a parameter for the same reason and one tier up.**  A

    :class:`~._scope.ReviewScope` builds one and hands it to this and to its own

    ``calendar_for`` separately and a third site answer the same question with
    its own ``MIN(start_date)``.  Three reads of one fact in one request is the
    defect the paragraph above describes, and two of them can disagree: under
    READ COMMITTED a concurrent payday write between the two loads would place
    a line by one calendar and bound its candidates by another.  Found by

    the disagreement is a COMMAND's alone** -- the three POST doors that build

"""What the books ALREADY HOLD that one bank line may be, in either direction.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b``.  Split out of :mod:`._reads`, whose subject
is *what the review screen shows about this pass*; this one answers a narrower
question that TWO pipelines now ask -- *does this period already hold money
arriving that no bank line explains, which recording this line would count
twice*.

**The question is about ARRIVING money and not about INCOME**, and every name
in this module said the narrower word until plan step
``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``.  The set is filtered on ``cash_amount > 0`` over
``ReviewSet.unmatched_rows``, which holds PURCHASE rows too -- a stored refund
is a positive-cash row there since ruling **bank_import:R-II** -- so the
answer always included rows that are not income.

**The split is what the 1,000-line ceiling on ``_reads`` was measuring.**  It
had one caller while only the INCOME door asked it.  Ruling **R-II** routes a
container-answered merchant credit into the PURCHASE pipeline
(:func:`~._verdict.ruled`), which must ask the same question of the same rows
-- and a predicate reached from two pipelines through a method on one of their
read models is the seam that ceiling exists to surface.

**Two facts since plan step ``bank_import:X-f6b-2`` (ruling
**bank_import:R-BI19**), one per direction, and the second exists because
the first's shape does not carry over.**  A deposit's counterpart is a bare
row in a PERIOD -- a salary row whose span covers the day -- so
:class:`ArrivalsAlreadyHeld` asks the period.  An outflow's counterpart is
the same money *in another shape*: a purchase logged by hand at another
amount or day, or a bill priced at another figure, so the amount is exactly
what is wrong and no figure test can find it.  What CAN find it is the two
things a hand-logged row shares with the swipe -- the merchant's name, and
the container the merchant's swipes go in -- and :class:`SpendingAlreadyHeld`
asks those.  Measured on the developer's own restore 2026-09-18 (X-f6b-2's
handoff s.3d-1): 14 of 51 creatable outflows, 11 of them lines the
search-gap guard does not reach, 1 needless warning among 20 accepted exact
matches.

    """Every unexplained ARRIVAL the books already hold for one line's period.

    Ruling **bank_import:R-GW**, added after this step's own adversarial review measured
    what the card was really protected by.  **Recording a deposit the books
    already hold is the only way this door can double-count money**, and the
    per-line safeguard the card was written around -- the pass's own near-miss
    sentence (:meth:`ReviewSet.search_gap_for`) -- fires only where some TIER
    admitted a candidate and declined it.  Measured on the developer's own
    data 2026-08-27: it fires on **4 of 16** recordable inflows, and the three
    it misses hardest are `$2,612.98`, `$2,612.97` and `$2,612.97` payroll
    deposits -- **`$7,838.92`** -- each sitting in a pay period whose books
    hold a `$2,473.38` salary row nothing explains.  Those rendered a bare
    one-click tick, with only a card-level paragraph between the owner and a
    duplicate; *a warning paragraph is not a door* is what ruling **R-GJ**
    measured `$7,412.94` going through.

    **It is a FACT and not a candidate**, which is the distinction ruling
    **R-GD**'s third amendment turns on: that amendment withdrew the reviewed
    line's candidate LIST because no bound made one anything but noise -- 0 of
    18 inspected correct.  This names no candidate and scores nothing.  It
    answers *does your budget already hold money arriving in this pay period that no
    bank line explains*, which is a question about the PERIOD, and it is the
    question whose answer decides whether recording this is a duplicate.

    **The one narrowing is a PROOF, not a threshold**, and it is the same
    argument ruling **bank_import:R-GW** rests on: a deposit SMALLER than the smallest
    unexplained arriving row in its period cannot be any subset of them, because
    every one of them is positive and already exceeds it.  So the five
    dividends of `$0.12`-`$0.22` and the three card refunds of `$11.73`-
    `$28.29` -- the eight lines this whole step exists for -- say nothing,
    while every payroll deposit does.  Measured on the developer's own data
    2026-08-27: **8 of 16** recordable inflows warn, against 4 of 16 for
    ``search_gap_for`` alone, and the three payroll deposits worth `$7,838.92`
    that had NO per-line signal now have one.

    **The obvious alternative tightening is refused**: warn only where the
    rows could SUM to this line is measured false on the shape it exists for --
    the 2026-03-26 payroll deposit is `$2,573.42` and its period's two rows
    come to `$2,573.38`, **four cents short**, which is finding **N-239**
    exactly.  A bound that misses the case it was built for is the tolerance
    this arc refuses; a bound that only drops what provably cannot match is
    not one.

    **THE SET IS WIDER THAN THE NAME SINCE RULING bank_import:R-II, AND THE
    NAME IS A DEBT plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3`` OWNS.**  The filter is
    ``cash_amount > 0`` over :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.unmatched_rows`, which
    holds PURCHASE rows beside transaction rows -- and
    :func:`~._candidates.purchase_candidate` sets ``cash_amount`` to the
    stored figure in the parent's direction
    (:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg`), so a stored REFUND
    under an expense row is a positive-cash row here.  That is
    the right SET: the question is *could this money already be in the books*,
    and a refund the books already hold is money that already arrived.  It is
    the wrong WORD, and the NAME is what plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``
    changed: this class was ``IncomeAlreadyRecorded``, the method was
    ``ReviewSet.income_already_recorded_in``, and the field the queue, the
    cards and two templates carry was ``income_already_held`` -- 74 references
    across 13 files, renamed together so no half of it can go on saying
    *income* about a set that holds refunds.  The two template SENTENCES said
    it out loud (*already holds N income row(s)*) and were changed in the same
    pass; the service-composed one had already been corrected at
    ``bank_import:X-gj-2b`` (see :meth:`why_it_could_double_count`), which is
    what left the name and the words disagreeing.

    NEW swipe under a standing rule with no press, and the only guards on

    and *the destination is proposed whole*.  A row whose figure sits more
    than :data:`~._near.NEAR_MISS_BOUND` from the line is never admitted by
    the near tier and never reported -- so a purchase the owner logged by

    developer's 2026-09-15 import: 21 of 150 undisposed lines are purchases
    logged at another amount or day, 10 are bills whose app amount differs.

    **Two shapes, one fact, and NO narrowing by amount.**  The amount is what

    the inflow value's proof (a deposit smaller than the smallest row cannot
    be any subset of them) is invalid here and is not copied.  The bounds are
    the day window the pass already pairs across (:func:`~._pairing.within_window`,
    :data:`~._pairing.DAY_WINDOW`) and the two things a hand-logged row shares
    with the swipe:

    * :attr:`named_for_merchant` -- rows whose label names the line's
      merchant (:func:`~._near.names_the_merchant`, the near tier's own word
      test), at any figure: a ``Food Lion`` purchase logged as `$50.00`, a
      bill called ``GEICO auto``;
    * :attr:`inside_destination` -- purchases under the DEFINITION the
      owner's rule files this merchant into (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6c``
      gave that container an identity across pay periods), whatever they are
      called: a ``weekly shop`` entry in Groceries.  Empty where no rule
      reaches the line, because there is then no destination to look in.

    **Rejected shapes, each measured or argued in the ruling**: mirroring the
    inflow's period-span test (an envelope IS a leaving row covering every
    day of its period, so every swipe would warn); either shape alone (the
    first misses ``weekly shop``, the second misses bills and rule-less
    lines); widening the near tier's published refusals to ``TOO_FAR`` (it
    cannot reach the container, and it would make *did not finish looking*
    say something false).

    **A row whose figure is NOT ITS OWN is never one of these, in either
    shape.**  An envelope is priced at its purchases and a CC payback at the
    card spend it repays (:attr:`~._offers.CandidateRow.states_own_figure`,
    ``False`` for exactly those two), so neither holds money the books do not
    already hold as the rows it is priced from -- and both stay in
    ``unmatched_rows`` for the hand-build form's sake, with negative cash.
    Counting the container beside its own purchase says `$100.00` for one
    `$50.00` row; and because a new envelope is NAMED FOR THE MERCHANT by
    default (both new-envelope forms offer the merchant as the name), a
    merchant-named envelope would be *named for* every later swipe into it
    from the moment the automatic door filed the first -- the door
    manufacturing the population it withholds on.  That is the ruling's own
    rejected shape (*an envelope IS a leaving row covering every day of its
    period, so every swipe would warn*) reached by another road, and the near
    tier refuses the same rows first of all
    (:attr:`~._near.NearRefusal.FIGURE_NOT_ITS_OWN`) for the same reason.

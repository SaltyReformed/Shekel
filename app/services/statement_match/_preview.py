"""What the hand-build form's two sides come to, BEFORE anything is applied.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-4``, ruling **R-FN**.

**Ruling R-FN says a difference is a transaction the owner ACCEPTS, and you
cannot accept a figure you have not seen.**  The proposals on the review screen
each state their own correction because the server built them; a group the
owner assembles from two checkbox lists is theirs, so nothing has computed it
yet.  This is what computes it.

**It runs the ACCEPT door's own reads and refusals, minus the writes.**  The
body it takes is the body Apply would send -- the same line ids and the same
reviewed row tokens, read through the same
:func:`~app.schemas.validation.statement_reconcile.reconcile_match_payload`
-- so the panel is not a second opinion about the act, it is that act asked
what it would do.
A screen that summed differently from the door is finding **N-336** one tier
up, and the surest way to have one number is to have one derivation.

**There is no longer an ordering token in that body**, and its absence is plan
step ``bank_import:X-gf-3b`` (ruling **bank_import:R-HC**).  It carried
``apply=hand`` while this form shared a page with the reviewed pass, where a
non-numeric index was the only thing keeping its ticks out of proposal ``0``'s
submission -- a money-correctness hazard held off by the two controls being
separate ``<form>`` elements, which is a property of the DOCUMENT.  The form is
a surface of its own now and posts a group with no index at all, so there is no
shared namespace left for two acts to collide in.

**It is a READ and it never writes** (:func:`~._accept.record_match` is the
only thing that does).  What it can do is REFUSE early: a group naming a
transfer shadow, or a row worth whatever its purchases are, is one the door
will not record, and saying so beside the checkboxes is better than saying it
after the press.

**The browser computes nothing.**  A first version of this step summed the two
sides in JavaScript from ``data-cash`` attributes and posted the result back as
the consent.  Three things were wrong with that and all three go away here: the
project's own coding rule says *JS never computes monetary values*; the
submitted figure was quantized by the schema with ``ROUND_HALF_EVEN``, the mode
``app.utils.money`` forbids, so a sub-cent figure was silently repaired into
agreement; and the same total ended up spelled four ways on one card.  Now the
server renders the figure and every option of the consent control carries the
server's own value.

**THE OPTIONS ARE THE ACTS** (plan step ``bank_import:X-gp``, ruling
**R-BI2**).  This used to decide ONE remedy from the member the owner had named
in a separate select and render one consent box whose label described it; the
door compared only the figure, so two acts submitted one consent.  It now
offers every act a difference can become -- **R-FN**'s ordinary row, and the
bank's figure written to each member -- as one option each, labelled with the
figures that act writes and valued with a
:class:`~._submission.ReviewedDifference` carrying the figure AND the member.
Which act the owner picks is no longer something this function is told; it is
what the door is told, once, in the value of the option they ticked.

frozen dataclass out, no Flask import.  It READS and never writes.

"""Apply everything the owner reviewed in ONE pass, and say what each item did.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3c-2``, finding **N-306**.  The review screen
offers two acts -- accept a proposed match, record a bank line as a purchase --
and until this step each one was its own request through its own money door.
Measured on the developer's own 2026-08-16 statement against a production
clone: **124 proposals and 91 recordable lines, 215 round trips**, each paying
``candidates_for`` at **3.593 s** before it wrote a row.  **12.88 minutes of
derivation to work one statement**, which is why the corrections do not get
made.  The same 215 acts through this door, end to end and applied for real:
**5.80 s**, against **762.7 s** for a control that re-derives per act -- and
the two produce byte-identical outcomes on all 215 items and identical balances
on six sampled days.

**It is not "accept everything"** (ruling **R-FP**).  Nothing here decides
anything: every item in a batch is one the owner ticked, carrying the same ids
the screen showed, and every one of them goes through the same door, the same
refusals and the same settle verbs a single-item request always did.  What the
batch removes is the round trip, not the review.

**The failure policy is the developer's ruling of 2026-08-19**: a refused item
leaves nothing behind and the rest still land, each refusal quoted with its own
sentence.  It is not a hypothetical bound -- 5 of the developer's own 124
proposals refuse today and will keep refusing, all of the same CLASS: a settled
credit-card payback whose recorded figure has drifted from the card entries it
repays, so any later entry edit on its envelope is refused (finding **N-323**,
two paybacks, `$59.68` of drift).  A batch that failed whole would lose 119
good corrections to it.

**How each item is isolated: a SAVEPOINT.**  ``db.session.begin_nested()``
around each act, released when it lands and rolled back when it refuses.  The
REQUEST is still the transaction and the route still owns the commit, so a
batch that dies part-way commits nothing at all -- the savepoint bounds a
DESIGNED refusal, never a failure.

**A ``PostingError`` is not a refusal and is not caught.**  It means a ledger
invariant is broken, which is a fact about the account rather than about the
item, so it fails the whole request loud (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 4).

**Order: every match, then every create, then every income, then every skip,
each in the order it was submitted** -- which is the order the screen renders
them, so the receipt reads down the page.  *This named two arms until plan
step ``bank_import:X-gj-4b``, and the income arm had been missing from it
since ``X-gf-1``* -- checkable: ``a4db019f`` adds the income loop and does not
touch this paragraph.  A sentence enumerating the loops is a claim about the code
below it, so it is re-counted off them rather than appended to.

**SKIP runs LAST, and that is the ruled precedence rather than an arbitrary
tail.**  A line can carry at most one verb (ruling **bank_import:R-HP**), and
:func:`~._skipping.skip_line` refuses a line an accepted match already answers
-- reading the database, so it sees what THIS pass has already flushed.  Put
the skips first and the same collision refuses the MATCH instead, through
:func:`~._resolve.load_lines`.  The developer's 2026-08-19 ruling on the
create-versus-match collision is that the act explaining money the records
already hold WINS, and this is that ruling one verb over: a skip records that
nothing explains the line, so it may not beat a match that does.  No browser
can submit the pair -- :func:`~app.schemas.validation.statement_reconcile
.reconcile_payload` keys one verb per line -- so this decides only what a
crafted body gets.  It is a real decision rather than an arbitrary one: two ticked items can
collide, because an envelope a match names may also be the destination a
recorded line was aimed at, and the guard against counting one purchase twice
(:func:`~._accept._reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase`) has to refuse one of
them.  Measured on the developer's own statement, 4 envelopes are both named by
a proposal and offered as a destination, and **15 of the 91 recordable lines
aim at one**.  The developer ruled 2026-08-19 that the PROPOSAL wins: it
explains money the records already hold against a line the bank showed, where
the recorded line can be re-aimed at another envelope on the next pass.

**Each item FLUSHES before the next is validated**, and that is what makes one
shared derivation safe rather than merely fast: the guard above reads the
database.

**Every LINE lock FIRST, in ONE order, before any arm runs** (plan step
``bank_import:X-gi-5``, finding **N-471**): four arms calling a door per item
took a pass's line locks in SUBMISSION order, and two presses naming the same
lines in different arms crossed.  :func:`~._resolve.lock_lines` carries the
argument, what it closes and what it leaves ``balance:X-bn``.

**It is NOT the only way one item can move a figure another item names, and
saying so was measured FALSE on 2026-08-19.**  Settling a matched purchase runs
``entry_service.update_entry``, which re-derives the envelope's CC Payback and
writes its ``estimated_amount`` -- a SIBLING rather than a child, invisible to
that guard.  What actually keeps a pass honest is that
:func:`~._candidates.repriced` re-prices every named row per act, and, since
plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-3``, that an item whose row has moved since the
screen described it is REFUSED rather than written (finding **N-336**).  This
paragraph asserted the refuted reason until an adversarial review found it
2026-08-23; ``_reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase`` had already been corrected.

**What it hands back lives in** :mod:`._outcome` -- :class:`~._outcome
.BatchOutcome` with its two item values, and the :class:`~._outcome.Tally`
the four arms and :func:`_run` here write and :func:`apply_reviewed` freezes
last.  They left this file at plan step ``bank_import:X-gt`` (ruling
**bank_import:R-BI7**, finding **BI-491**), a pure move made with it at 998
of pylint's 1000 lines.

        **Ruling R-GH's boundary, made unrepresentable rather than maintained**
        (plan step ``bank_import:X-ge``).  A rule is consent for CREATING a row

        hand -- re-date, re-price, settle, group-match -- keeps its tick, and
        those are exactly the acts :func:`~._accept.accept_match` performs.

        it; this is the same sentence one tier up, where a caller could
        otherwise assemble the batch that contradicts it.

        A TICKED batch carrying no items at all is legal and ordinary -- it is
        what an untouched form posts -- so nothing here counts.

        **A rule pass may not carry an INCOME either** (ruling **bank_import:R-GW**,
        plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-1``), and that is a second sentence rather

        merchant's SPENDING goes, so there is no answer it could hold that
        means *record this deposit*.  The door itself already refuses -- it is
        called with ``applied_by_rule=False`` as a literal -- and this is the
        same fact at the tier where a caller could assemble the batch that
        contradicts it, exactly as the match arm is.

        **A rule pass may not carry a SKIP either** (plan step
        ``bank_import:X-gj-4b``), and this arm is about the STORE rather than
        about the act class -- which is why it is a third sentence and not a
        widening of the first.  Ruling **R-GH** would permit it on its own
        terms: a skip creates a decision and modifies no row the owner made by
        hand.  What refuses it is that ``budget.statement_line_skips`` carries
        no ``applied_by_rule`` column, so nothing could record that a rule
        performed the act -- and three surfaces then state something false.
        The Skipped tab's Undo says *the record that YOU decided this bank
        line is explained by nothing*; :func:`~._filing.rule_filed_acts`
        selects on ``StatementMatch.applied_by_rule``, so a skip reaches no
        receipt item and no one-click undo, which is exactly what rulings
        **R-GH** and **R-GG** promise; and
        :attr:`~._filing.RuleFiling.filed_total` sums
        :attr:`~._outcome.AppliedItem.amount` over what landed, under the caption *what
        the bank moved on the lines a rule filed*, so a skipped line's figure
        would be reported as money a rule filed when a skip files nothing.

        **It is also true that no ANSWER means skip today**: ruling
        **bank_import:R-JH** holds that *never a purchase* states no
        disposition, and :class:`~._rules.RuleAnswer`'s five members contain no
        other candidate.  That is the reason this refusal is a CHECKLIST rather
        than a boundary -- the step that mints a sixth answer lifts it, exactly

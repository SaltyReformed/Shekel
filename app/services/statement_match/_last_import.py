"""What the account's MOST RECENT import did, beside the hero.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-1b``.  The locked direction
(``docs/design/bank_import_audit.md``, "The page") puts one line right of the
hero's four figures -- *Last import <day> - N lines recorded - N filed by
rules - receipt* -- so that a routine session reads *import, read the receipt,
work the inbox, see the difference reach zero*.  This module is the whole of
what that line states.

**It is PROVENANCE and not a figure that answers "am I done"**, which is why
it is its own value rather than three more fields on
:class:`~._reconcile.Hero`.  That class carries one comparison on one day and
documents its three money figures as all-or-nothing; what an import wrote is a
fact about an act the owner performed, and it is present or absent on its own.

**One row read and, when it finds one, two COUNTS** -- and neither is
asked at all of an account nobody has imported into.  How many lines an
import WROTE is DERIVED from the sightings since plan step
``bank_import:X-f6b-1`` (ruling **R-IY**): the lines it was the FIRST to
sight, read off the one aggregate the statements page's *New* column reads
(:meth:`~app.models.statement_import.StatementLineSighting.counts_by_import`),
so the two surfaces cannot report one import two ways.  How many of those
lines a STANDING RULE filed is a fact about the acts that name them.
Counting the lines rather than the acts is what makes the sentence's halves
comparable: a rule files one line per act today
(:func:`~._filing.file_new_swipes` submits one
:class:`~._creations.PurchaseCreation` per line), so the two agree on every
input that exists, and counting lines stays true of a multi-line act that
does not exist yet.

**The rule-filed count is EXACT rather than an approximation of one.**
``applied_by_rule`` is written only by a :attr:`~._batch.Consent.STANDING_RULE`
pass, the only door that assembles one is :func:`~._filing.file_new_swipes`,
and it reaches ``_fresh_line_ids(account_id, import_id)`` alone (ruling
**bank_import:R-GI**) -- so a rule-filed act naming a line import X first
sighted was performed by import X's own filing run, and no second column has
to record that.

Measured on a restored production clone 2026-08-30 (``shekel_xgj1b_m``, the
developer's own account 1): three imports, the newest of them
``2026-08-24 20:45 UTC`` recording **2** of the **42** lines its file held --
which is what a re-import of an overlapping span looks like, and why the line
states what was RECORDED rather than what the file contained.

**The two reads narrow by DIFFERENT columns, and that is deliberate rather
than an oversight.**  The ACTS are narrowed by owner and account, which is
what :func:`~._accepted_view.accepted_counts` and
:func:`~._filing.rule_filed_acts` both do and for the reason recorded there.
The IMPORT is narrowed by account ALONE, exactly as
:func:`~app.services.statement_import.import_history` narrows it: an import
belongs to one account, the route has already proved that account is the
caller's, and ``statement_imports.user_id`` records WHO PERFORMED the import
rather than who owns the row.  Adding it here would read as a second
ownership check while actually being a filter that could one day hide a real
import from the account's owner.  Censused on a restored production clone
2026-08-30: 0 imports carry a ``user_id`` differing from their account's.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in, a
frozen dataclass out, no Flask import, no clock read.

"""What the RECONCILE screen shows: one card per bank line, on four verbs.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-1a``; rulings **bank_import:R-HP**, **R-HQ**,
**R-HR**, **R-HS**, **R-HW** and **R-HX**.  The direction this builds to was
locked at Loop A round 4 on 2026-08-29 and is
``docs/design/bank_import_audit.md``.

**One page replaces three.**  The review queue, the register and the
hand-build workbench become five TABS over one list -- To explain, Explained,
Filed by rules, Transfers, Skipped -- with a hero that answers *am I done* and
holding chips for the lines that are not work.  This module is the whole of
what that page displays; the template displays it and computes nothing.

**Every tab is its own request, and that is a measurement rather than a
style.**  Ruling **R-GX** split the register off the review screen because
rendering both valued all 221 of the developer's accepted acts to draw a panel
he was not reading -- 442,109 bytes of a 578,523-byte page.  Folding them back
into one render would rebuild exactly that, so :func:`reconcile_page` builds
the cards of ONE tab and takes the other four's counts from
:func:`~._accepted_view.accepted_counts`, :func:`~._skipping.skipped_count`
and the pass itself.

**What each tab holds, and where its cards come from:**

===================  ==========================================================
tab                  source
===================  ==========================================================
To explain           the pass: :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.proposals`,
                     ``creatable``, ``recordable_inflows`` and
                     ``answered_never``, in three sections by what SUGGESTED
                     the verb (**R-HP**)
Explained            :func:`~._accepted_view.accepted_register`, acts a person
                     ticked
Filed by rules       :func:`~._accepted_view.accepted_register` narrowed to
                     the acts a standing rule performed (**R-GT**)
Transfers            the pass's ``parked`` lines, which a source files as
                     paying an account the owner holds -- a HOLDING state
                     (**R-HQ**), never inbox work
Skipped              :func:`~._skipping.skipped_acts` over
                     ``budget.statement_line_skips`` -- the owner's own
                     decision that a line explains nothing (**R-JG**,
                     **R-JH**), bounded and linked past like the settled tabs
                     (**R-GX**)
===================  ==========================================================

**THE SKIPPED TAB IS THE RESULT'S HOME, AND IT LANDS BEFORE THE CONTROL THAT
FILLS IT** (plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c-2``), which is the order rulings
**R-GY** and **R-HU** put those two in.  Its history is worth one paragraph
because two of its states were wrong in different ways.  It first listed the
pass's barred lines the owner had answered *never a purchase* for, on the
argument that the standing answer WAS the disposition; ruling
**bank_import:R-JH** refuted that -- *not a purchase* is not *explained by
nothing* -- and ``X-gj-4c-1`` returned those lines to the inbox, which left
the tab holding a hard-coded empty tuple.  It reads the store now, and **plan step
``bank_import:X-gj-4b`` gave that store its first writer**:
:func:`~._batch._apply_skips` calls :func:`~._skipping.skip_line`, so the
count is whatever the owner has skipped rather than 0 on every account.
*This said the count was still 0 until that step lit the verb, and the step
has shipped.*  The point it was making survives unchanged: what the tab shows
is a fact about the DATA rather than about this module, and whatever a door
records, this tab renders.

**A line with no available act never enters To explain** (**R-HQ**).  That is
what makes the inbox reach zero: measured 2026-08-29 on the developer's own
account, 9 of the 27 unexplained lines are card payments no screen in the app
can resolve, and a queue that cannot empty is not a queue.  **A line the owner
answered *never a purchase* for HAS one** -- it keeps MATCH, and since plan
step ``bank_import:X-gj-4b`` it HAS SKIP, which ruling **bank_import:R-JI**
shuts only for a merchant a source files as paying an account the owner holds
and so never for this class -- which is why **R-JH** puts it back in the inbox
without breaching this.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in,
frozen dataclasses out, no Flask import, no clock read.  Every read it
performs takes the owner and account the route proved, exactly as
:func:`~._accepted_view.accepted_register` does.

"""What this pass did NOT look at, and why it cannot conclude about a line.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-3a``.  Values with one subject -- the LIMITS
of one pass over one account -- split out of :mod:`._reads` so that the module
which answers *what does the review screen show* is not also the module that
answers *what did this pass fail to look at*.

**The two DAY bounds APPLY here too since plan step balance:X-f3c-2b-2b.**
``_reads`` held the two functions that shorten a pass's line list -- at the pay
calendar's first day and at the account's books opening -- while this module
held the values reporting what they removed, so the rule and its disclosure sat
in different modules and only :func:`bounded_lines` states their ORDER.  That
order is load-bearing: the two bounds overlap heavily on real data, and
applying each to the whole set would count 130 of the developer's own lines
under both.

**The TIMING was forced by a line cap, and saying so is the honest version.**
``_reads`` stood at 973 of pylint's 1,000 lines before that step and the books
split is 26 more, so the two could not both stay.  Colocating a bound's value
with the function that produces it is defensible on its own and is why the move
went this way rather than some other -- but it is not why it happened now, and
a docstring that gave only the good reason would be the decaying premise this
arc keeps finding.

**The split is what makes the rule verdict possible at all.**
:mod:`._verdict` has to ask why the pass would not conclude about a line, and
asking :class:`~._reads.ReviewSet` would be a cycle: :mod:`._filing` imports
:mod:`._reads`, so :mod:`._reads` cannot import the module that reads its own
verdict.  Housing the question here rather than in :mod:`._verdict` is the
other half of the same discipline: every live caller of :func:`search_gap`
except one is about a line no rule reaches -- the queue's INFLOW rows, the
hand-build list -- so a module named for what a RULE comes to would have been two
subjects wearing one name.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in,
frozen dataclasses out, no Flask import, no clock read, no query -- every fact
it holds arrives from the pass that measured it.

    Plan step **balance:X-f3c-2b-2b**, finding **N-383**, ruling

    the books open, so every dollar the bank moved on or before that day is
    inside the one figure.  Such a line is not work and never becomes work:
    matching it settles a row for money the opening already holds, and
    recording it as new spending or new income does the same.
    :func:`._split_at_books_open` therefore takes it out of the pass

    :class:`ReviewBounds` at pylint's attribute ceiling rather than buying a
    disable for a grouping the data already has.

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-ge``, developer ruling 2026-08-26, corrected at
    ``X-ge-1``, moved here from :class:`~._reads.ReviewSet` at ``X-gf-3a``.
    :meth:`~._reads.ReviewSet.search_gap_for` is the screen's spelling of it
    and delegates here.

    **It READS what the search reports and derives nothing**, which is the
    whole of the correction ``X-ge-1`` made.  A first version enumerated the
    bounds :class:`ReviewBounds` and the near tier PUBLISH, and called
    that enumeration complete; an adversarial review measured it false twice
    over, because the matcher applies more bounds than it published.
    Re-deriving them here would have been a third spelling of
    :data:`~._near.NEAR_MISS_BOUND` and :data:`~._pairing.DAY_WINDOW` outside
    the modules that own them -- finding **N-322** exactly, which
    :mod:`._pairing`'s own header predicts in as many words.  So each tier
    reports its own refusals now (:attr:`~._propose.ProposedMatches
    .declined_lines`) and this joins them to the two bounds that belong to the
    PASS rather than to any line.

    **What that makes true:** a tier added later must put its refusals in
    ``declined_lines`` or they are invisible, which is the same rule the search
    already keeps for its crowded days -- rather than this function having to
    be taught about it.

    **Why the answer is per LINE and not a count in a panel**: ruling
    **R-GD**'s third amendment withdrew the reviewed line's candidate LIST
    because no bound made one anything but noise -- 0 of 18 inspected correct
    -- and moved what survives onto the line itself, which is the ground plan
    step ``bank_import:X-f6d-3`` acted on and ``X-gf-3a`` extended to the rule
    verdict beside it.  A bound reported in a panel names no line and cannot be
    acted on.

    The three sources, in the order a reader should hear them:

    * what a TIER declined about this line, in that tier's own words: a near
      candidate it admitted and would not choose between (the
      `$356.61`-for-one-`$178.29` shape, finding **N-335**), one it refused for
      want of the merchant in the row's label, one it refused for the day
      window, and an EXACT candidate the window refused;
    * a CROWDED day the GROUP search skipped, measured within
      :data:`~._pairing.DAY_WINDOW` of the line because that is the window
      :func:`~._propose._groups` pairs a line to a bucket across;
    * a row the amount model could not PRICE at all.  It is account-wide and so
      is this refusal: an unpriced row is absent from the candidate set
      entirely, so there is no line it can be said not to match.

    **Measured on the developer's own 378 recorded lines (2026-08-26):** the
    last two are ZERO, and the first touches 12 of the 80 lines a standing rule
    would file -- `$391.77` -- one of which is his own `Apple Music` row
    sitting one day past the window from an `Apple` line the door would
    otherwise have recorded a second time.

    Args:
        line: The bank line, which must be one this pass considered.
            **THREE surfaces take it off three different lists**, and the claim
            that "every caller takes it off ``creatable``" was already false
            when it was written: the queue's OUTFLOW rows read it off
            :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.creatable`, the hand-build form off
            :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.unmatched` (which is the only one an
            inflow used to reach), and since ruling **bank_import:R-GW** the
            queue's INFLOW rows off :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.recordable_inflows`.
            What every caller does share is that the line was in THIS pass,
            which is what makes *declined_lines* answerable for it.
        declined_lines: What each tier declined about a line, by line id
            (:attr:`~._propose.ProposedMatches.declined_lines`).
        crowded_days: The days the GROUP search refused to look at, as it
            reports them (:attr:`~._propose.ProposedMatches.crowded_days`).
        unpriceable_count: How many of the account's rows the amount model
            could not price (:attr:`~._offers.Candidates.unpriceable_ids`).

    Returns:
        One sentence naming the gap, for the receipt that has to say what it
        withheld and for the screen that has to say why a line is still there;
        ``None`` when this pass searched exhaustively for a counterpart to
        *line* and found none.

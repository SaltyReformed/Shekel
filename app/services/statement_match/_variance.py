"""What a match's two sides come to, and the member that closes the gap.

Plan steps ``bank_import:X-f6d-4`` and ``bank_import:X-gj-3a``; rulings
**R-GD**, **R-FN** and **R-HT(b)**.

**THE DOOR cannot say which member a difference belongs to, and it does not
guess.**  Three rows summing to one deposit, five cents short, is not five
cents this module can attribute: nothing it reads says which of them the bank
varied.  So where nothing says, it RECORDS the missing movement as an ordinary
row with no category and the row becomes a member of the match -- the identity
``Sigma(lines) == Sigma(members)`` holding BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a
refusal, which is the balance test ceasing to be a fence the door enforces and
becoming an invariant it maintains.

**THE OWNER can say, and since plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-3a`` they may**
(ruling **R-HT(b)**: *where the residue lands -- onto a named row, re-pricing
it, or its own uncategorized row*).  That is not the paragraph above being
weakened: a stated attribution is a DECISION, and this module still derives
none.  What it costs is one refusal the lone-row shape never needed
(:func:`_reject_unrepresentable_landing`) and one thing this module must not
claim -- that a group's gap is *five cents the bank moved that the app has no
row for at all*.  It says that where the owner says nothing; it does not say
it as a fact about the world.  An earlier version of this paragraph did, and
:class:`~._landing.DifferenceLanding`'s own measured population then
asserted the negation.  *That read "eight hundred lines below it" while the two
shared a file; plan step ``bank_import:X-gq`` moved the class out.*

**Ruling R-FN is what the row is**, and its mechanism already exists: an
ordinary transaction with ``category_id`` NULL books to the per-owner
``Uncategorized Income`` / ``Uncategorized Expense`` ledger account through
``ledger_account_service.get_or_create_category_ledger_account``, needs no new
ledger-account kind, and is CATEGORIZABLE later through the ordinary edit
door -- which is the mechanism that shrinks the bucket.  It is emphatically NOT
a plug to ``anchor_equity``: that is what R-FN replaced, and plan step
``balance:X-f4`` deletes the machinery it would have used.

**The measured population is finding salary:N-391, the bank-side half of the
retired N-239.**  On a
production clone carrying the developer's own 376 recorded lines, SEVEN payroll
deposits are 2-3 app rows summing ``$0.04``-``$0.06`` under what the employer
actually paid -- ``+$0.35`` across the span -- and before this step every one
was refused outright, so the deposit could not be recorded at all and its
member rows never had their day corrected either.  **Measured by APPLYING all
seven through this door and reading the ledger** (``-0.35`` in Uncategorized
Income), rather than by a query that approximates the matcher: an adversarial
review's own replay found six, missing the deposit whose rows settled five days
after the line posted -- which the day window admits and a same-day heuristic
does not.  Ruling **R-GD**'s "6 of 16" is an earlier, different count, taken
before any of this arc's tiers existed.  this makes the residue VISIBLE as seven
named rows instead of six refusals, which is what ruling R-GD calls the louder
instrument.

**The CAUSE sentence here read "``paycheck_calculator``'s rounding residue is
the cause and plan step ``balance:X-aw`` owns it" and both halves are now
false** (corrected at plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-3a``).  `N-239` called the
calculator's residue-apportionment and the bank-side gap ONE mechanism, and
`N-391` records that as MEASURED FALSE -- `X-aw` shipped and the gap did not
move, because the residue rule's whole range was `{$3,525.96, $3,525.97}`.
What `N-391` says instead is that ``salary_profiles.annual_salary`` divides to
a per-paycheck gross four cents under the stub the employer issues, and its
owner is ``salary:X-av``.  A cause sentence nobody re-checks is exactly the
shape that decays.

**Nothing PROPOSES a residual and nothing may.**  R-GD's own measurement is
why: ``n choose k`` puts 20 leftover lines within 1% of some same-day row set,
a Van Loan transfer inside a Capital One payment at **0.0064%**, tighter than
the six true payroll groups at 0.0019%.  A subset sum hits any target, so a
near miss over a group is coincidence.  The residual exists only where the
OWNER built the group by hand and agreed to the figure.

**The figure the owner agreed to TRAVELS, and the door reconciles it.**  That
is finding **N-336**'s lesson applied to the one number no other guard checks:
``_resolve._reject_moved_since_review`` compares each ROW against the state the
screen described, so a per-row figure cannot drift -- but the SUM is a second
derivation over those rows, and no per-row guard can see it being wrong.  So
the submission carries what was shown
(:attr:`~._submission.MatchSubmission.accepted_difference`) and
:func:`reject_unrecordable` refuses the act when this module's own arithmetic
disagrees.

**The screen gets that figure from HERE**, through
:func:`~._preview.preview_hand_build`, which runs these same reads and
refusals without the writes.  A first version of this step summed the two
sides in the BROWSER and posted the result back; the panel is server-rendered
now, so the figure the owner accepts and the figure this module tests are one
derivation rather than two in two languages -- which also removed a
``ROUND_HALF_EVEN`` quantizer that had been repairing a sub-cent consent into
agreement.

**WHERE THE DIFFERENCE LANDS MOVED TO** :mod:`._landing` **at plan step
``bank_import:X-gq``**, a pure move that took :class:`~._landing
.DifferenceLanding`, :func:`~._landing.corrected_figure` and their reader out
of this file and left every word of this docstring where it was.  The argument
above is ONE argument and spans both halves, so dividing it would have meant
rewriting it; the cost of leaving it whole is finding **bank_import:BI-484**.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in, a
frozen dataclass out, no Flask import.  :func:`mint` MUTATES and does NOT
commit -- the route owns the unit of work.

    any match whose two sides did not sum to the same figure was refused and
    the owner sent away to retype the number the statement already carried.
    That refusal was not neutral: a line the screen would not explain is the

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-4``, rulings **R-GD(a)** and **R-FN**; the
    shape rule below is the developer's ruling of 2026-08-30 (plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-1b``).  What the two remedies have in common is that
    both WRITE the gap somewhere the owner did not type it -- onto the single
    row a match names, or into a new uncategorized row -- so both are gated on
    the same consent, and this is the gate that makes "accepts" true rather
    than decorative.

    **ONE rule: a difference this door would WRITE must have been reviewed,
    and the figure reviewed must be the figure derived.**  It reads three ways
    and they are the same sentence:

    * there is a difference and the submission states none.  The shipped
      behaviour, naming both sums and the gap and saying what to do about it;
    * there is a difference and the submission states a different one.  The
      per-row guard (:func:`~._resolve._reject_moved_since_review`) cannot see
      this: it reconciles each ROW against the state the screen described, and
      the difference is a subtraction OVER those rows.  A screen that states
      one total over a door that writes another is finding **N-336** one tier
      up, and so is a screen whose total was true when it was drawn;
    * there is NO difference and the submission states one anyway.  It earns
      its own sentence, because the comparison below would report a figure
      that "now comes to +0.00" when what happened is that the rows stopped
      disagreeing.

      **It is NOT reachable by a screen whose rows moved**, which an earlier
      draft of this said: :func:`~._resolve._reject_moved_since_review` runs
      inside ``resolve_rows``, which is evaluated as an ARGUMENT to
      :func:`~._accept.record_match` and so strictly before this gate -- a row
      whose figure or revision drifted is refused there, by name, with its own
      reload sentence.  What reaches here is a body that states a figure over
      rows that add up: a crafted one, or the race in which the owner ticks
      the consent and then ticks a row and presses Apply before the re-price
      returns.  The arm is kept because this function is total over its
      inputs, not because a stale page produces it.

    **The gate turns on THIS DOOR's derivation and never on the submission's
    shape**, which is the whole of the 2026-08-30 ruling.  It exempted *a
    single line against a single row* until then, on the premise that the near
    tier offers exactly that shape and its card states the figure -- so a
    SHAPE was read as a proxy for *the screen already disclosed this*.  A proxy
    for a fact the wire could carry is a guess, and the Reconcile page's
    tickable proposal rows manufacture the shape: untick one row of a proposed
    group and what arrives is one line against one row, indistinguishable from
    the tier's own offer.  Measured 2026-08-30 on a clone of the developer's
    production data, over the 137 proposals his account offers:

    * the exemption was load-bearing for **2** -- line 338 writing `-$0.15`
      and line 218 writing `-$0.04`, both onto ``Groceries: Walmart``;
    * **3** carried more than one row, and unticking down to one wrote, with
      nothing asked, `$25.51` or `$59.77` on line 253, up to `$437.76` on line
      257, and up to **`$2,572.36`** on line 358 -- the bank's `$2,611.90`
      payroll deposit written onto a `$39.54` ``Phone Allowance`` row.

    An allowlist that existed for four cents permitted twenty-five hundred
    dollars.  The two near-tier proposals state their figures on the wire now
    (:func:`app.jinja_filters.stated_difference`), and no shape is exempt
    from anything.  **Every one of the 137 proposals now emits that
    field**, not only the two that carry a figure: it is what a match
    says it was reviewed against, and a card that emitted it only when
    it was non-zero would make its absence mean two things.

    **A ZERO difference requires no figure, and the reason is the WRITE PATH
    rather than who derived the predicate.**  Both tests are the door's own
    arithmetic over a submission its sender shaped, so *sender-controlled
    versus door-derived* does not separate them -- an earlier draft of this
    paragraph said it did, and an adversarial review measured that false.  What
    separates them is what each predicate is ABOUT.  The old one predicted
    *what the screen had disclosed*, which this door cannot know and so had to
    proxy.  This one predicts *what this door is about to write*, which it can
    check.  At a zero difference the bank leaves the attributed member exactly
    what it already holds -- :class:`~._landing.DifferenceLanding` subtracts
    the OTHER
    members from a bank total the two sides agree on -- so
    :func:`~._landing.corrected_figure` answers ``None`` whether a member is
    named or
    not, and :func:`~._accept.record_match` resolves no residual period
    because the difference is zero.  The two writers a difference has are both
    provably idle and there is no act to consent to.

    **That clause used to read "``bank_cash_for`` answers ``None`` for a
    group", and plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-3a`` made it false** without
    changing the conclusion: an ATTRIBUTED group does name a member.  Restated
    against what the figure comes to rather than against which arm produced
    it, because this is the stated reason a money control may be skipped and a
    reason nobody re-checks is the one that decays.  **The rule is therefore "no figure is required
    exactly where no figure would be written", and it is not a shape.**

    Requiring one anyway would also have refused every exact match built with
    scripting off, where the panel never re-renders and so can state no figure
    -- a real capability, removed to gate a write that does not happen.

    **WHAT THIS CONSENT BINDS IS THE FIGURE AND NOT THE REMEDY, and the
    developer ruled that bound KNOWN AND ACCEPTED on 2026-09-01** (ruling
    **R-IV**, plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-3a``; found by adversarial code
    review).  **The ruling is a ROW and not only this paragraph**: a docstring
    is where the next author of THIS gate meets a decision, and not where a
    reviewer auditing consent handling looks.  Since that
    step a submission carries two things -- the difference agreed to, and the
    member it lands on -- and this gate compares only the first against
    :attr:`MatchSides.difference`.  So a body CAN pair the consent rendered
    under *record the difference as a row with no category* with a
    ``difference_on`` that re-prices a budget row instead: two acts the
    :class:`~._preview.HandTotals` docstring itself calls *different acts with
    different consequences*, under one agreement.

    **A browser cannot produce it, and that was verified rather than
    assumed**: the attribution select sits inside ``.rec-match-picks``, whose
    change swaps ``closest .rec-match`` with ``outerHTML``, and the consent box
    is inside that element -- so it always re-renders UNTICKED.  *Not on the
    ``?open=`` pane, where nothing swaps; :mod:`._opened` states the narrower
    ground that holds it there and `X-gn` must re-read.*  The only party who
    can craft such a body is the account's own owner, on their own rows.  **Rejected: widening the
    consent value to carry the remedy beside the figure.**  That is R-IA's rule
    one field wider and it is not wrong -- it was refused because it changes
    the wire format of a field two surfaces submit and one strict reader
    grades, to close a path whose only traveller is the person consenting.
    **What this DID remove, stated because the paragraph above would otherwise
    read as though nothing was lost**: a one-line one-row NEAR MISS can no
    longer be corrected with scripting off.  That is the ruling working rather
    than a casualty of it -- with no script the panel never states the figure,
    so the owner cannot have seen what would be written to their row -- but it
    is a capability the exemption was silently providing, and the two surfaces
    that used to promise it in their JavaScript-off wording no longer do.

    """Refuse a difference the named member's own row cannot hold.

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-3a`` -- **and it is a refusal the LONE-ROW
    shape never needed, which is why the widening had to bring one.**  A
    transaction stores a non-negative GROSS whose direction comes from its
    ``transaction_type_id`` and never from the figure
    (:func:`~._landing.corrected_figure`'s own note), so the only cash it can
    be moved to
    is cash of the direction it already has.  For a match naming ONE row that
    was guaranteed: :func:`_reject_opposed_movements` compares the two sums,
    and with one row ``sides.app`` IS that row's cash, so the bank's figure
    could never oppose it.

    **A group breaks the guarantee, and this module's own docstring says
    why**: *mixed signs WITHIN a group stay legal, because a net deposit
    really is a gross income row less a deduction*.  So the select offers the
    negative member too, and the bank can leave it a figure of the other sign.

    Worked example, which is the shape it exists for.  A `+$2,060.00` deposit
    against a `+$2,050.00` salary row and a `-$50.00` deduction row comes to
    `+$2,000.00`, `$60.00` short.  Attribute that to the DEDUCTION and the bank
    says that row is worth `+$10.00` -- and an expense row cannot be worth
    `+$10.00`.  Without this refusal the door writes `$10.00` as a magnitude,
    the row settles at `-$10.00`, and
    :func:`~._accept._reject_drifted_under_the_act` catches the arithmetic and
    reports *"Applying this match moved one of its own rows"* -- which is
    false, nothing drifted, and it sends the owner to match the rows one at a
    time when what they did was point at the wrong member.  **A guard that
    catches the right state under the wrong name is not the guard**, which is
    the shape finding **N-332** records one column over.

    **A PURCHASE is asked only about ZERO**, because it stores a SIGNED amount
    since ruling **R-II** -- a refund is a negative purchase -- so either
    direction is representable and only *worth nothing* is not
    (``ck_transaction_entries_positive_amount``, now ``amount <> 0``).

    compares the whole reviewed value, so an attribution disagreeing with its

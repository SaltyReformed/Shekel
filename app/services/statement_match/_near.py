"""The SECOND tier: a figure that nearly agrees, scored rather than gated.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-1``, ruling **R-GD(b)**, finding **N-335**.
:mod:`._propose` explains what the bank and the app agree about to the cent;
this module explains what is left, where the two disagree by a little and a
second fact says they are the same movement anyway.

**Why it exists, in one figure.**  Bank line 285 (`ACH DEBIT GEICO PREM COLL`,
`-178.29`, posted 2026-07-02) sat THREE CENTS from transaction 2461 (`178.32`,
settled 07-06).  The exact predicate offered nothing, the review screen's
next-cheapest act recorded the line as a NEW purchase, and the ledger booked
`$356.61` for one `$178.29` movement.  The gate was the defect; a score is the
remedy.

**It is a SECOND tier rather than a wider first one**, and that is a claim
about evidence rather than about code.  An exact figure is a strong
coincidence; a near one is not, so a near pairing may never displace an exact
one and the exact tier's optimality argument is left exactly as it was.  This
module runs over what that tier could not explain.

**A score is not a licence** (**R-FP**): everything here is still a PROPOSAL
the owner reviews, and ruling **R-FZ(c)** gives it its own sweep class, because
it is the only proposal on that screen that changes what money was spent.

Services-boundary discipline: plain data in, frozen dataclasses out.  No
database, no clock, no request.

    **The corroboration a near miss needs, and it is a REQUIREMENT here rather
    than the tie-break ruling R-GD(b) first wrote** (developer decision
    2026-08-22, on measurement).  An EXACT figure is its own evidence: two
    unrelated movements agreeing to the cent inside a fortnight is a
    coincidence the day window and the assignment already handle.  A NEAR
    figure is not -- at half a percent of `$131.74` there is 66 cents of room,
    and an account holds hundreds of rows -- so an inexact claim needs a second
    fact, and the merchant is the only independent one a statement line
    carries.

    **Measured, on a production clone carrying the developer's own 376 lines.**
    Of the nine leftover lines with a row within 1%, the five whose row names
    the merchant are all the same movement (`Geico`/``Geico``,
    `Walmart`/``Groceries: Walmart``) and all five are ACCEPTED by the accept
    door; the four whose row does not are a `Lowe's` swipe against a
    ``CC Payback: Mint Mobile``, an `Amazon` swipe against ``Father's Day`` AND
    ``CC Payback: Claude Max`` at the identical distance, and an `Amazon` swipe
    against a ``Kayla`` envelope.  Two of those four the door would have taken,
    re-pricing an unrelated envelope; and a proposal on any of them also
    REMOVES the line from the create-a-purchase arm (:func:`~._reads._unexplained`),
    taking away the act that is actually correct.

    **It is not a general matching rule and must not become one**, which is the
    same measurement from the other side: only 59 of today's 129 exact 1:1
    proposals name the merchant, because the bank says
    ``POINT OF SALE DEBIT L340 DATE 03-26 HARRIS TEETER`` where the budget says
    ``Groceries``.  Requiring it of the exact tier would throw away 70 correct
    proposals.  It is corroboration for a WEAK claim, not a predicate.

    **It reads the COLUMN, never** :attr:`~._offers.BankLine.merchant_label`.
    Ruling **R-GA(a)** drew exactly that line: the label falls back to the
    whole description so a name box is never blank, and a rule keyed on that
    fallback would fire on the identical 32 characters SECU's OFX truncates 326
    of 361 descriptions to.  ``None`` means *this source names none* and
    corroborates nothing, which is the direction a missing fact has to fail in
    -- so a source with no merchant field proposes no near misses at all, and
    the owner's own hand-build form is what R-FP reserves for asserting one.

    **The merchant must appear as a WHOLE WORD, and a bare substring was a
    real hole** rather than a tidiness point.  ``merchants.name``
    is a ``String(100)`` whose only constraint is that it is not blank, so a
    two-character merchant is storable and real -- `BP` is a filling station --
    and unanchored containment made `BP` corroborate ``Subprime Loan Payment``,
    dissolving for that line the one independent fact this tier has.  Measured
    2026-08-22: with the boundary the developer's own five proposals are
    unchanged, so the anchor costs nothing it was buying.  A MINIMUM LENGTH was
    rejected instead of this -- it would refuse `BP` itself, which is a real
    merchant naming a real row.

    `$18.64` swipe.

    **What this does NOT return is a RANK, and that is a measured decision
    rather than an omission** (2026-08-22, on two independent adversarial
    reviews of this step).  A first implementation ranked the admitted
    candidates by ``(amount distance, day distance)`` and proposed the best
    one.  Both terms were then measured to be incapable of choosing:

    * the AMOUNT cannot, and this module's own header is the proof.  A
      `Lowe's` swipe sits **0.106%** from a ``CC Payback: Mint Mobile`` row
      while two genuine `Geico` pairs sit **0.180%** out -- so distance does
      not order true before false, which is precisely why the merchant is
      required at all.  Two rows that BOTH name the merchant have exhausted
      the evidence, and separating them by two basis points is arithmetic
      dressed as a finding;
    * the DAY cannot either, on the rows where it would matter most.  A
      purchase the reconcile panel ticked carries a SPAN window, and
      :func:`~._pairing.days_outside` scores every day inside a span ZERO --
      which :func:`~._propose._least_cost_pairing` compensates for by ORDERING
      its rows, a compensation no scoring pass has.  Measured on the
      developer's own account: **59 of 61** reconciled purchases share
      ``settled_on = 2026-08-18`` with purchase days up to 128 days earlier,
      so their spans overlap wholesale.  Reproduced: two `Walmart` purchases
      of `-52.10` (made 04-01) and `-52.15` (made 06-20) against a `-52.12`
      line posted 06-20 both score day-distance 0, and the rank picked the
      EIGHTY-DAY-OLD one on a two-cent margin.

    **So a contest is REPORTED, not resolved** (:func:`near_misses`), which is
    the rule :func:`~._propose._groups` already states for its own ambiguity:
    *an ambiguous proposal is a question dressed as an answer*.  A separation
    threshold between best and runner-up was the other remedy and is refused
    under conventions rule 3: **0** lines on the developer's own data have two
    admissible candidates, so there is nothing to measure one against, and a
    number chosen without a measurement is the tolerance R-GD(b) rejects
    wearing a different name.  Ordering the candidates a REVIEWED line offers
    is `X-f6d-3`'s, where the screen that shows them lives.

    Every refusal below is a gate the ACCEPT DOOR would apply, asked here so
    the screen cannot render an Accept that must fail:

    * an EXACT pair is not this tier's.  :func:`~._propose._one_to_one` and
      :func:`~._propose._groups` have already had it, and a near tier that
      could re-offer one would be a second answer to a question already
      answered;
    * a row whose figure is not correctable
      (:attr:`~._offers.CandidateRow.figure_is_correctable`) -- a transfer
      shadow, an envelope worth its purchases, a payback worth the spend it
      repays.  Measured live: 2 of the 4 uncorroborated near candidates on the
      developer's own clone are CC paybacks, refused by the door by name;
    * the bound, and the merchant (:func:`_names_the_merchant`);
    * the day window (:func:`~._pairing.within_window`), which is the pair
      legality test the exact tier already uses -- INCLUDING the purchase
      floor, so a near miss cannot offer a pairing ``update_entry`` refuses.

    **A SIGN disagreement needs no test of its own and that is arithmetic, not
    an omission.**  The accept door refuses one, and a row whose cash sits
    within half a percent of the line cannot have the opposite sign: were the
    signs opposite, ``|line - row|`` would be ``|line| + |row| > |line|``,
    which fails the bound outright.  Both magnitudes are non-zero --
    ``ck_bank_statement_lines_amount_real_nonzero`` for the line, and the two
    readers that build candidates decline a row worth nothing
    (``_candidates._transaction_candidates`` through ``transaction_candidate``,
    and ``_candidates._purchase_candidates`` through its own ``if
    entry.amount``).

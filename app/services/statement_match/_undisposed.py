"""Which of an account's recorded lines no act has ANSWERED yet.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4a``, ruling **bank_import:R-HP**: every bank line
ends on exactly one of MATCH, ADD, TRANSFER or SKIP, and the Reconcile inbox is
the lines with none yet.  This module is the one statement of *none yet*.

**It is a module because the question has TWO acts behind it.**  An accepted
match answers a line (MATCH and ADD both leave a
:class:`~app.models.statement_match.StatementMatch`), and a recorded skip
answers one with nothing
(:class:`~app.models.statement_line_skip.StatementLineSkip`).  :func:`undisposed`
is the clause that joins them, and :func:`undisposed_lines` is its one reader.

**Since plan step ``bank_import:X-gm`` this module also states what the INBOX
is** (:func:`inbox_partition`), which is *no act has answered it, both day
bounds admit it, and no holding state claims it*.  The grid's badge counts that
walk and the review pass is built from it, so a figure and the page it links to
cannot answer different questions.  Until that step the badge ran a SQL count of
its own that restated two of the pass's Python predicates and had never heard of
a third: it read **27** where the page's inbox read **18**.

**It was three functions inside** :mod:`._reads` **until this step**, and the
split is ruling **balance:R-IR**'s rule rather than a preference: that module
stood at 989 lines against pylint's 1,000-line ceiling, and the fourth
predicate plus the prose it owes does not fit in eleven lines.  R-IR puts the
split on the session that BREAKS the module, and the boundary it takes is the
one stated above: this is the one statement of *none yet*, and
:mod:`._reads` assembles what the review screen makes of it.  *A first draft
justified the line differently -- ":mod:`._reads` is the review screen and
``awaiting_review_count``'s consumer is the grid" -- which its own contents
refute, since two of the three functions that moved serve the review screen.
Named by adversarial design review 2026-09-02.*  Nothing was reworded on the
way across except where this step made a sentence false, and each of those is
marked.

            (:meth:`~._bars.MerchantAnswers.is_a_holding_state`) -- money a
            source says moved between two accounts the owner holds, whose verb

    Plan step ``bank_import:X-gm``.  **ONE WALK** (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14): the
    grid's badge counts what this returns and the review pass is built from
    what this returns, so the two cannot disagree about membership.

    **It is PYTHON and not SQL, and that is the ruling rather than an
    accident** (developer 2026-09-05).  A SQL predicate would have been
    cheaper.  Measured on the developer's own Checking at migration head
    2026-09-05, 378 recorded lines of which 157 are undisposed, medians of 15
    runs with the session expired between: **1.21 ms** for the SQL count this
    replaced, **1.64 ms** for a prototype SQL mirror of the same answer, and
    **3.05 ms** for this walk as shipped.  It would also have had to restate
    :func:`~._rules.pipeline_for` in SQL, which means restating
    :meth:`~._rules.RuleAnswer.of` -- a discriminator ``merchant_rules``
    deliberately does not store, because "a stored discriminator is a second
    statement of what the columns already say".  Three SQL restatements of
    Python predicates to fix a disagreement CAUSED by two SQL restatements of
    Python predicates is rule 14's own failure mode, and **1.84 ms** on the
    grid render is what not doing it costs.

    *The 1.64 ms figure is a PROTOTYPE's and the other two are the tree's*,
    which is why it is the one qualified: nothing in ``app/`` computes it, so
    it cannot be re-measured by running this code.

    **So this DELETES two fences rather than adding three.**  The count it
    replaced spelled the calendar bound as ``posted_on >= opens`` and the books
    bound as ``posted_on > opened_on`` in SQL, beside
    :func:`~._gaps.bounded_lines`' Python; both spellings are gone, and so is
    the arm that graded them against each other.

    **The cost is O(the account's UNDISPOSED lines), and the figure above is
    one account's.**  This hydrates every undisposed line and then drops the
    ones both day bounds exclude -- 157 rows to reach 27 on the developer's
    Checking, of which 130 predate his pay calendar -- where the ``COUNT(*)``
    it replaced touched none.  An owner who imports years of history and never
    reconciles pays for the whole backlog on every ``/grid``, so the 3.05 ms is
    a measurement of one account at one time and not a bound.  Narrowing the
    load to the day bounds is the obvious remedy and is NOT taken here: those
    bounds are :func:`~._gaps.bounded_lines`' to state, and pushing them into
    SQL is the restatement this step exists to delete.

    **IT ALSO CHANGES WHAT THE PROPOSER IS GIVEN, which is more than a
    membership decision.**  :func:`~._propose.propose` is a cascade over a
    SHARED row pool -- :func:`~._propose._one_to_one` is a least-cost pairing
    over all of them, then :func:`~._propose._groups` searches what it did not
    claim, then :func:`~._near.near_misses` what neither did.  Taking the
    holding states out therefore frees the rows they would have been paired
    with, so a DIFFERENT line can now be proposed a match, and a row can fall
    through to the near tier, whose accepted proposal re-prices it to the
    bank's figure (ruling **R-GD(a)**).  Second-order, the same deletion
    shrinks :func:`~._verdict._proposed_destinations`, so
    :func:`~._filing.file_new_swipes` -- the door that files with no press --
    withholds fewer rule filings than before.  Ruling **R-HQ** is what makes
    the change right; neither consequence is a side effect worth leaving for a
    reader to discover, and
    ``test_awaiting_count.TestTakingTheHoldingStatesOffTheProposerCostsNoACT``
    is where the first is graded.

            of one fact in one request is this project's DRY violation, and the
            read this replaced was a second ``budget.pay_periods`` scan on the
            app's hottest render path.

            **The BOOKS opening is NOT a parameter beside it, and the asymmetry

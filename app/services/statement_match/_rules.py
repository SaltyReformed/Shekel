"""What a merchant RULE is, and what this account has one for.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3d``, decomposed at ``bank_import:X-gd-2``.  The
review screen's leftover list is 91 lines on the developer's own statement and
**21 merchants**, so the work it asks for is 91 decisions where the real
question was asked 21 times.  This module holds the ANSWER to those 21 and what
it can still resolve against; :mod:`._stating` is the door that records one and
:mod:`._placement` is what an answer comes to for a single line.

**The split is by CONSEQUENCE, not by size** (the module passed 1,000 lines and
that is what forced the question, not what answered it).  Everything here
READS: a value type, four indexed queries and one derivation over them, none of
which can mutate a row.  Everything in :mod:`._stating` writes.  A reader that
needed only to know what the owner said used to import a module that also held
the write door, its refusals and its receipt vocabulary.

**Nothing here writes money, and nothing here CAN.**  A rule is read to
SUGGEST; the only thing that records a purchase is an explicit destination
submitted for one specific line (:mod:`._create`).  That separation is the
developer's ruling of 2026-08-19 and it is what keeps ruling **R-FZ**'s *the
destination select IS the tick* whole: the select still opens on *leave this
line alone*, the rule is rendered beside it, and one sweep control -- the
same shape the per-class proposal sweep already has -- is what turns
suggestions into ticks.  A default that arrives pointing at money is exactly
what R-FZ removed, and a remembered default would be one.

**A rule resolves against the pass's own offer set, so it can never widen
it.**  :func:`~._placement.placements_for` picks from
:func:`~._candidates.destinations_for` -- narrowed by what this pass has
already matched -- rather than querying for a row of its own, which is the
property :func:`~._resolve.resolve_rows` rests on: a destination the screen may
not offer is one a rule cannot reach either.  Every way a rule can fail to
resolve is REPORTED rather than substituted for, because substituting is how a
suggestion becomes a guess.

    **A closed set of five, and the model's CHECK is what closes it**
    (``ck_merchant_rules_one_answer``).  It is derived from which columns a row
    carries plus one boolean rather than stored beside them, because a stored
    discriminator is a second statement of what the columns already say --
    which is :meth:`of`'s own argument, and ruling **R-GS**'s.

    The absence of a rule is NOT a member: it is ``None`` where a
    :class:`StandingRule` would be, and the screen says *you have not said*
    rather than *you said nothing*.  Collapsing it into :attr:`ALWAYS_ASK` is
    the tempting move and it loses the one fact that separates them -- *I have
    not decided* against *I have decided to have no standing answer* -- which
    is exactly what an import must not confuse, because one of them is a
    question still owed to the owner and the other is a question already
    answered.

    **Three of the five SUGGEST and two do not, and the split is not
    cosmetic.**  :attr:`TEMPLATE` and :attr:`NEW_ENVELOPE` name a container for
    money LEAVING, so :func:`~._placement.placements_for` resolves them against
    one outflow line.  :attr:`INCOME_CATEGORY` names what money ARRIVING is, so
    :func:`~._placement.inflow_placement_for` resolves it against one inflow
    line.  :attr:`NEVER` names none and BARS -- it is a
    :class:`~._bars.CreationBar`, resolved before a destination is looked for
    (ruling **R-GJ**) -- and :attr:`ALWAYS_ASK` names none and bars nothing,
    which makes it the only answer whose effect on money is exactly the effect
    of having said nothing.

    **A CONTAINER ANSWER RESOLVES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, and that is plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-2``'s correction to this paragraph.**  It used to read
    *the three that suggest are told apart by DIRECTION as well as by
    container, and no answer resolves in both directions* -- true only while
    ``ck_transaction_entries_positive_amount`` forbade a negative purchase.
    :attr:`TEMPLATE` and :attr:`NEW_ENVELOPE` name a container for that
    merchant's money in EITHER direction: money leaving is a purchase, and money
    arriving is a REFUND -- a negative purchase back into the same container
    (ruling **R-HT(a)**).  Only :attr:`INCOME_CATEGORY` is one-directional, and
    it is so because an outflow under it names no container to spend from.

    **ELEVEN of those twelve cells RESTATE what the code already did, and ONE

    ``04980186`` ``_creatable_lines`` took EVERY outflow and ``placements_for``
    fell through to ``None`` for ``INCOME_CATEGORY``, and ``_recordable_inflows``
    took EVERY inflow including ``NEVER`` with ``inflow_placement_for``
    answering ``None``. Both behaviours were determinate and both are unchanged
    here.  They were never STATED in one place, which is what this table fixes;
    that is a clarification and not a decision, and the claim carried a
    developer attribution it did not deserve.

    **The one real change is (container answer, inflow)**: from an income
    candidate carrying an unresolved reason, to a PURCHASE -- the refund.

    Two cells are worth reading twice even though neither moved, because the
    table is where their reasons now live:

    * **money OUT under ``INCOME_CATEGORY``** enters the purchase pipeline with
      NO suggestion.  Naming a container the owner never gave would be the
      guess ruling **R-HX** refused, so the owner picks by hand.  **A reviewer
      argues this should be the mirror of the refund** -- a withdrawal from an
      income merchant is a clawback or a fee, a contra-INCOME -- and that is an
      open question for the developer rather than a settled cell.
    * **money IN under ``NEVER``** enters the income pipeline with NO
      suggestion, and is not barred HERE.  Whether ruling **R-GJ**'s bar should
      reach an inflow at all is a separate open question, argued at
      :func:`~._bars.reject_barred_line`; this cell only records that routing
      does not decide it.

    **An outflow is always a PURCHASE candidate**, whatever the answer -- the
    rule only decides whether anything is SUGGESTED inside that pipeline, and
    ``NEVER`` is then answered by :class:`~._bars.CreationBars` further down,
    which is where ruling **R-GJ** put it.

    Args:
        amount: The line's own figure, on the bank's convention (positive INTO
            the account).  **The AMOUNT rather than a caller-computed bool**,
            which is this step's own adversarial review's correction: the bool
            made every caller spell ``line.amount > 0`` for itself, so a change
            whose commit title read *the SIGN stops routing* had in fact taken
            the executable sign tests in this package UP rather than down; the
            re-measured counts are in :func:`is_inflow`, which is the one place
            that census is stated.  The
            direction is asked HERE, through :func:`is_inflow`, so the
            convention is written once.  Not the LINE, because the two callers
            hold different types -- the screen a :class:`~._offers.BankLine`
            and the write doors a ``BankStatementLine`` -- and neither should

    **One derivation at one instant**, which is the same argument
    :class:`~._scope.ReviewScope` makes one tier down and is not a parameter
    list dressed up: a rule names a template and a category, and whether
    either is still reachable is read from the same moment the rule is.
    Read separately, a category archived between two of those reads would be
    resolvable by one caller and refused by the next inside one render.

    Attributes:
        rules: What the owner has answered, by merchant id
            (:func:`rules_for`).
        template_names: What to call each recurring definition a rule on this
            account may name (:func:`offerable_templates`) -- the option list,
            and the sentence an unresolvable placement explains itself with.
        active_categories: The categories a new envelope may still be created
            under, and the ones an income answer may still file a deposit into
            (:func:`active_category_names`).  **One mapping for both**,
            because it is one question -- has the owner retired this category
            -- and an answer naming a retired one is reported rather than acted
            on, in either direction.  It carries the NAMES too, so the card
            that states an income answer prints the label from the same read
            that resolved the answer.
        stale_templates: What to call a template a stored rule NAMES that is
            no longer offerable, by id.  **A rendered control must be able to
            show the answer it holds, even a stale one**: without this the
            select had no option carrying the stored value, so it displayed --
            and submitted -- its first, which is *I have not said*, and the
            next Save silently WITHDREW a rule the owner never touched.  A
            template is deactivated or un-enveloped through
            ``routes/templates/crud.py``, so this is live user state rather
            than a hypothetical.  Found by adversarial financial review
            2026-08-19.  Usually empty, and then it costs no query at all.
        stale_categories: The same, for a CATEGORY a stored answer names that
            is no longer active, by id (plan step ``bank_import:X-gd-2``).
            **BOTH answer columns feed it since plan step
            ``bank_import:X-gj-2a``** -- the category a *new envelope* answer
            creates under, and the income category a deposit answer files under
            -- because what this dict answers is *what is this archived
            category called*, which is one question and has no direction.  One
            id can arrive from both answers on two different merchants, and a
            set is what makes that cost one lookup.  **The template arm had this and the
            category arm did not**, and the category arm's failure was worse:
            with no option carrying the stored value the select submitted
            ``""``, which reaches the door as a NEW ENVELOPE answer missing its
            category and is REFUSED -- so pressing Save to answer about one
            merchant printed "a new envelope needs both a name and a category"
            for another the owner never touched, on every pass, naming the
            wrong half.  Found by two adversarial reviews 2026-08-26, which
            also measured what made it reachable: teaching
            ``archive_helpers.category_has_usage`` about this table turned a
            permanent delete (which cascaded the rule away, leaving nothing to
            mis-render) into an ARCHIVE, which is exactly this state.

"""What a still-planned transfer LEG is WORTH on the screen of the account it is on.

The fourth subject of :class:`~._subjects.RowKind` (leaf
``balance:X-bi-6-4c-1``, rulings **R-BAL87**, **R-BAL106**, **R-BAL158**,
**R-BAL159**): one side of a TRANSFER whose money has not moved, offered as
the transfer itself -- keyed by the transfer's id on the screen's account --
where the matcher offered the transfer's SHADOW row until this leaf.  Its own
module because :mod:`._valuation` crossed the 1,000-line bound when this
subject joined it (ruling **balance:R-IR**: the session that breaks a module
splits it, by SUBJECT); the seam is the KIND.  What a leg is worth
(:func:`leg_price`), what it is called (:func:`leg_candidate_label`), the one
construction the offer set and the re-price share (:func:`leg_candidate`) and
the re-price's LEG arm (:func:`repriced_leg`) live here; which of a side's two
subjects is offered is ``transfer_legs.leg_is_planned``'s (ruling **R-BAL79**
per side), never spelled here.  A PAID leg is a
SETTLEMENT -- a payment, whose parent is a leg rather than a row -- so its
constructor stays with the other SETTLEMENT's in :mod:`._valuation`, and that
module imports this one, never the reverse.

**No function here reaches a transfer through its shadow row**: a leg arrives
as a ``transfer_legs.TransferLeg`` from ``transfer_legs``' loaders, and its
figure is asked of the leg (``transfer_service.leg_settle_amount``, whose
interval body is the one shadow reach).  ``X-bi-6-4d`` moves that body and
nothing here changes.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): reads only, plain
data in, frozen dataclasses out, no Flask import, no clock read.

    signed by :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.cash_leg_of`, which asks the
    leg its direction and contributing gate off its transfer and side.

    **Two refusals leave the candidate set, and neither is swallowed**:
    ``AmountUnresolvable`` is :func:`~._valuation.transaction_price`'s case, and a
    ``ValidationError`` is a DAMAGED transfer -- a shadow pair that is not
    one live expense and one live income shadow, which the leg price
    refuses because the settle would (``_validation._get_shadow_transactions``;
    no door writes the state: 0 of 128 live transfers on the 2026-09-30 00:11
    production dump).
    Ruling **R-BAL158** (developer 2026-09-30, "Skip it and say so"): such a
    leg is not offered and is counted in the screen's "could not be
    priced" note, the reconcile panel's answer (**R-BAL148**) on this
    screen's own surface.  **The catch is by TYPE**: every
    ``ValidationError`` the leg price can raise today is the broken pair's
    (``settle_amount``'s own refusals cannot fire on a pair the loader
    verified live), so one added to that chain later reads as unpriceable
    too -- counted, never a silent drop and never a page that will not
    render.  ``X-bi-6-4d`` re-bodies the price off the parent and the
    refusal goes with the pair.

        leg: The still-planned leg, its transfer loaded with

"""One CARD per bank line, and the sections the inbox groups them into.

Plan steps ``bank_import:X-gj-1a`` and ``X-gj-1b``; rulings
**bank_import:R-HP**, **R-HQ**, **R-HR**, **R-HS**, **R-HW** and **R-HX**.
:mod:`._reconcile` assembles the PAGE; this is the card it is made of, and the
two are separate modules because they are separate subjects -- and because one
file holding both passed the 1,000-line ceiling that already split
:mod:`._accepted_view` out of :mod:`._reads`.

**The same card renders on all five tabs**, which is the whole design: the
inbox, the holding tab, the skipped tab and the two settled tabs are one list
seen five ways, not five screens.  THREE kinds exist because the three
subjects carry disjoint facts -- a :class:`LineCard` has a bank line and a
:class:`~._panel.VerbPanel`, an :class:`ActCard` has an Undo and what it would
destroy, a :class:`SkipCard` has a bank line and an Undo that destroys nothing
-- and one value holding empty versions of another's fields is a control one
Jinja condition away from rendering, which is what
:class:`~._bars.BarredLine` exists to refuse.

*It said TWO until plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c-2``*, which built the
Skipped tab: a recorded skip is neither a bank line the books have not settled
nor a :class:`~app.models.statement_match.StatementMatch`, so it is neither of
the first two kinds and could be made to look like one only by leaving fields
empty.  Which kind a tab holds is the TAB's own fact (:class:`CardKind`), and
that value replaced a BOOLEAN for exactly this reason -- a two-valued answer
has no third arm to give.

**What the card SHOWS and what the panel DISCLOSES are two values** (ruling
**R-HR**, plan step ``X-gj-1b``).  :class:`LineCard` carried twelve attributes
under a ``too-many-instance-attributes`` disable while it held both, and the
page needed two more -- which act ADD would perform, and the rows MATCH
offers.  :mod:`._panel` holds the disclosure now, so the disable is DELETED
rather than raised: the boundary ruling R-HR draws is stated in the type
system, and a template cannot print a panel fact beside the sentence because
it is not there to print.

    condition over a tab's name: the three kinds carry disjoint fields and
    disjoint controls, so a template that guessed would print a field that is
    not there.

    **It replaced a BOOLEAN**, ``Tab.holds_settled_acts``, and the
    replacement is what the Skipped tab forced rather than a tidy-up.  That
    predicate partitioned five tabs into *acts* and *bank lines*; a recorded
    skip is an ACT with no :class:`~app.models.statement_match.StatementMatch`
    behind it and a bank line the reader can print, so it answers the
    boolean's question with neither value.  A third arm cannot be added to a
    two-valued answer, and widening the boolean's meaning is how a tab comes
    to render the wrong partial with nothing raising.

    **It is carried on the PAGE and not on the TAB** (**R-JX**), and that
    placement is the whole of what makes it one fact.
    A ``Tab.holds`` property read from a table beside a dispatch that
    independently built the cards was ONE fact with TWO homes: set the table
    to :attr:`ACT` for the Skipped tab and the page still built
    :class:`SkipCard` values, the template still picked the act partial, and
    the page 500'd on a field that is not there -- with nothing but a test
    holding the two in step.  :attr:`~._reconcile.ReconcilePage.kind` is set
    BY the dispatch that builds the sections, so the two-home disagreement is
    gone and its reconciling test with it -- LOCAL rather than impossible,
    which the paragraph below states exactly and **R-JX** insists on.
    ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14: where a rule says two places must always agree,
    they are one value with two homes, and the remedy is to delete a home.

    **What that buys is LOCALITY, not impossibility, and the difference is
    worth stating exactly.**  Each arm of :func:`~._reconcile._tab_sections`
    still writes a :class:`CardKind` literal beside the builder it calls, so
    ``CardKind.ACT, skip_sections(...)`` still compiles.  What changed is that
    the two halves are now one line apart in one function instead of a table
    in one module and a dispatch in another -- a mistake a reader SEES rather
    than one only a test can find.  *An earlier draft of this paragraph said
    the disagreement was "unrepresentable", which is the word the design
    doctrine reserves for a defect that cannot be written; adversarial review
    named the overclaim, and the test below this module's own change says the
    opposite four lines from where the docstring said it.*

    * ``LINE`` -- :class:`LineCard`: a bank line the books have not settled.
      It renders INSIDE the Apply form, because its OK is what that form
      submits.
    * ``ACT`` -- :class:`ActCard`: an accepted match, with the Undo that
      destroys what it created.
    * ``SKIP`` -- :class:`SkipCard`: a recorded skip, with the Undo that
      destroys the decision and nothing else.

    The last two render OUTSIDE the Apply form: an Undo is a ``form``, a form
    cannot nest in a form, and neither tab has anything to Apply.

"""What an unexplained bank line may BECOME, and where it would land.

Ruling **bank_import:R-GW**, plan step ``bank_import:X-gf-1`` split this out of
:mod:`._reads`.  **The seam is the SUBJECT**, which is the argument
:mod:`._section` already makes one module over: that one answers *what does the
review screen SHOW about this pass*, and this answers *what may one line the
matcher could not explain be turned into*, which is a different question with a
different grain -- one answer per line, and every one of them a door.

**Three answers, and a FOURTH class that has none** -- which is what this
module being one module makes visible, and a first draft of this header claimed
the three were total and was measured FALSE by this step's own adversarial
review:

* a line becomes a PURCHASE against a budget line the owner picks
  (:class:`CreatableLine`, ruling **R-FX**).  **Every outflow, and the INFLOWS
  whose merchant carries a spending answer** -- such a credit is a REFUND, a
  negative purchase back into that container (ruling **R-HT(a)**, plan step
  ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-2``);
* a line whose merchant is barred becomes nothing here, and carries the reason
  (:class:`~._bars.BarredLine`, ruling **R-GJ**).  **In BOTH directions**, and
  this paragraph said *an inflow is never barred: both arms of the bar are
  claims about money leaving* until plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2b-3``.  That
  is true of *never a purchase* and FALSE of *your bank files this merchant as
  a payment to an account you hold*, which is a claim about the MERCHANT -- so
  a credit from a card-payment merchant is barred exactly as its debits are.
  The retraction was written into :func:`_creatable_lines` one commit later and
  this paragraph, which a reader reaches FIRST, was left asserting the argument
  that had just been measured false.  **A barred line goes to ONE OF TWO
  lists** since plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c`` (ruling
  **bank_import:R-JH**): :attr:`Leftovers.parked` where a source files the
  merchant as paying an account the owner holds, and
  :attr:`Leftovers.answered_never` where the only bar is the owner's own
  answer -- because that answer shuts the ADD door and says nothing about what
  the line IS, so the line is still unexplained work;
* every OTHER inflow becomes an uncategorized INCOME row
  (:class:`RecordableInflow`, ruling **bank_import:R-GW**).

**THERE IS NO FOURTH CLASS SINCE PLAN STEP ``bank_import:X-gm``, and deleting
it is that step's own root cause.**  A line the bank dates MADE after it POSTED
used to reach none of the three: :func:`_creatable_lines` dropped it before the
split into ``ReviewBounds.impossible_day_count``, a number naming no line.  What
that cost was not a count -- it was the line.  :func:`~._card_sections
.to_explain_sections` builds the inbox from four lists and this was in none of
them, so such a line reached NO CARD on the Reconcile page at all, on no tab,
and survived only in :attr:`~._reads.ReviewSet.unmatched` for the workbench
plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-2`` deletes.  It is a :class:`CreatableLine`
carrying :attr:`CreatableLine.withheld` now -- the identical remedy an
adversarial review applied on 2026-08-29 to a line no saved pay period covers,
one refusal over (see :func:`_one_creatable`).  Finding **N-325**'s ruling is
untouched: the app still does not choose between the bank's two days, and
:func:`~._scope.impossible_days_refusal` is the one sentence saying so.  0 of
the developer's 378 recorded lines are this shape; the OFX adapter's own
measurement found 2 of 361, so a second source makes it live.

**The third was missing until 2026-08-27 and the gap was invisible because the
three lived apart.**  ``_creatable_lines`` took ``amount < 0`` and nothing took
the other side, so eight of the developer's own deposits -- `$58.87`, five
dividends and three card refunds -- had no act on the review screen at all,
while the two refusals that should have caught it pointed at each other.

**AND THE SIGN WAS THE WRONG DISCRIMINANT ALL ALONG**, which plan step
``bank_import:X-gj-2b-2`` corrects.  Those two sign tests decided what a line
BECAME before the owner's rule was consulted -- exact only while a purchase had
to be positive.  A merchant credit is money arriving that must become a
purchase, so :func:`~._rules.pipeline_for` is the partition now and the sign is
one of its inputs.  The three card refunds in the paragraph above are the
lines that were on the wrong side of it.  A
module whose whole subject is *what may this line become* is where a missing
direction is one function short rather than nowhere -- and the fourth class
above is the proof that it works: it was invisible while these lived apart and
is a bullet here.

**The split is a line cap made useful rather than worked around**, exactly as
:mod:`._creations` and :mod:`._section` record: adding the inflow arm took
:mod:`._reads` past this project's 1,000-line module bound, and the two honest
answers are to cut the record or to cut the module.

    period's groceries as one envelope and the bank records every swipe:
    measured on the developer's own statement **91** unmatched outflows survive
    every proposal, of which 74 are card swipes worth `$3,383.49` -- the case
    R-FS names -- and 17 are ACH debits the app may already hold in another
    shape, which the screen SAYS rather than filtering on the bank's prose.

            older than the owner's first payday looks like.  The MADE day and

            ``purchased_on`` and a swipe made on a period's last day and posted
            on the next period's first belongs to the budget it was made under.
        destinations: The budget lines it could become a purchase against, in
            that period.  EMPTY is a real answer and the screen must say so
            rather than rendering a chooser with nothing in it: on the
            developer's own data the 2026-03-26 period holds three envelopes and
            all three closed at a fixed figure, so 8 lines worth `$662.13` have

            destination that arrived already selected would be a default
            pointing at money, which is what ruling **R-FZ** removed.

            and are not known when this value is built.
        withheld: Why the create door would REFUSE this line, or ``None``
            when it would not.  **Symmetric with**
            :attr:`RecordableInflow.withheld` **and asked of the same

    was SPENT somewhere the budget already holds, which is a claim about an

    that could be true of one.

    **A RULE is asked, since plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-2a``** (ruling
    **R-HT(a)**), and the two are not in tension: a bar refuses an act, and
    this suggests one.  A merchant answered *never a purchase* still reaches
    :func:`~._placement.inflow_placement_for` and still resolves to nothing
    there, so the bar's silence about deposits costs no safety -- the answer
    simply names no income category, which is the same as having said nothing.

        # **``answered_never`` is NOT a third term, and it is not needed as
        # one.**  A first draft of plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c`` added it
        # on the reasoning that those lines had been inside ``parked`` and so
        # were already counted -- which adversarial review measured FALSE: they
        # were passed in before and produced no row THEN either.  Membership of
        # that list requires :attr:`~._bars.CreationBar.NEVER_A_PURCHASE`,
        # which :meth:`~._bars.CreationBars.build` reads out of ``view.rules``,
        # and :func:`~._section.merchant_section` emits only merchants
        # ``not in view.rules`` -- so the term could not have produced a row on
        # any input a database can hold.  That is ruling **R-GX** holding
        # structurally: an ANSWERED merchant is on the register, and *never a
        # purchase* is an answer.  Stated rather than kept, because a term no
        # input can reach is a fence, and one nothing grades is a fence that
        # reads as coverage.

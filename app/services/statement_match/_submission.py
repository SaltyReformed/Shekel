"""What the owner sends BACK, and the state they sent it back against.

:mod:`._offers` is what the app OFFERS; this is the other direction.  That
module's own docstring has always drawn the line -- *a* :class:`MatchProposal`
*is a candidate the app OFFERS; a* :class:`MatchSubmission` *is what the owner
sent back* -- and plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-3`` is where the two stopped
fitting in one file.  The seam is the DIRECTION, not the line count: everything
here is read off a request body and must survive a hostile one, and nothing
there is.

**Why a submission carries a figure at all, when it deliberately never did.**
Finding **N-336**: the review screen states the correction accepting would
write -- *from ``-178.32`` to ``-178.29``* -- and until this step nothing
compared that with what the door was about to write.  ``resolve_rows``
re-derives each named row's price per act (finding **N-309**'s remedy, correct
in itself) and :func:`~._variance.corrected_figure` then wrote the bank's figure
whatever the re-derived price was.  **Reproduced**: the row was edited to
``500.00`` in another tab between render and Apply, and the door wrote a
**``$321.71``** correction under a ``$0.03`` caption.

**The exact tier never had this, and that is the shape of the regression
rather than an oversight.**  An equal match whose price moved became UNEQUAL
and was refused outright (**R-FV**), so staleness failed CLOSED by accident.
``X-f6d-2`` made an unequal one-to-one RECORDABLE (**R-GD(a)**) and
``X-f6d-1`` made it reachable from a tick, and the accident stopped protecting
anything.  :class:`ReviewedRow` restores that closure deliberately, for every
tier, and states WHY it refused.

**A precondition is not a payload.**  Nothing here is written.  Every figure
and every day the door commits it still re-derives from the rows the ids name,
inside the same transaction; what arrives on the wire is only *what the owner
was looking at*, which is the one question ruling **R-FP** asks -- *what
commits is what was reviewed* -- and the one thing no id can answer.

    function's own reason.**  The same figure is submitted in two shapes --
    inside a row's reviewed token, and as the difference a match states it was
    reviewed against -- and reading them through two READERS was measured on
    2026-08-23 to have let three spellings past one gate that the other
    refused.  Writing them through two WRITERS is the same defect with the
    sides swapped, and a codec whose halves sit in two modules is the drift
    this package names as its own root cause; a first version of plan step
    ``bank_import:X-gj-1b`` put this in :mod:`._sides` and made
    :mod:`._submission` import it back.

    Three callers spell a figure FOR THE WIRE and all three come through here:
    this module's own reviewed row token, :attr:`~._preview.HandTotals
    .consent`, and -- new at ``bank_import:X-gj-1b`` --
    :func:`app.jinja_filters.stated_difference`, the difference a tier's
    proposal states on the card that offers it.

    **One other site spells a figure with ``:f`` and is deliberately NOT
    here**: :meth:`~._panel.MatchCandidates.matching` builds the text an
    owner's typed search is compared against.  That is a SEARCH predicate and
    not a submitted value -- nothing reads it back -- so routing it through
    this function would couple a display decision to a wire format and make a
    change to either answerable only by reading both.  The census is
    ``grep -rn ':f}"' app/``, which returns exactly those two lines.

    **``:f`` and never ``str()``.**  ``Decimal.__str__`` emits scientific
    notation for a small enough exponent (``Decimal("1E-7")`` is ``"1E-7"``)
    and :data:`_FIGURE` admits no ``E``, so the door would refuse a body this
    app had emitted.

    **Its precondition is TWO decimal places, and it is the caller's.**  ``:f``
    fixes the notation and not the precision: :data:`_FIGURE` admits one to six
    places, so a figure carrying seven would be spelled faithfully and then
    refused by :func:`parse_figure` -- measured 2026-08-30, where
    ``Decimal("1E-7")`` and ``Decimal("0E-8")`` are the only two of fifteen
    probe values that do not round-trip.  Every figure that reaches here is
    quantized to cents by :meth:`~._sides.MatchSides.of`'s ``round_money`` and
    descends from ``Numeric(12, 2)``, so the state is unreachable and carries
    no guard -- an arm for it would be error handling for an impossible
    scenario.  It is written down because "the notation is safe" and "the
    round trip is total" are different claims and this docstring used to imply
    the second.

      moves ``-178.32`` to ``-153.32``.  Only the FIGURE sees it -- a
      transaction's cash is ``gross - off_statement_sum(entries)``
      (:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.cash_leg_of`) and a CHILD insert emits
      no UPDATE against the parent, so no counter on the parent can move;

    :func:`~app.services.reconcile_service._rows.record_settled` re-derives its

    :class:`ReviewedRow` adds is a PRECONDITION rather than a payload.

    **The rows are ONE collection rather than two id lists** (plan step
    ``bank_import:X-f6d-3``).  ``transaction_ids`` and ``entry_ids`` were the
    same fact discriminated by table, and a row and the state it was reviewed

    **The real alternative was NOT "two parallel lists", and an adversarial
    review was right that arguing against that one is arguing against a straw**
    (2026-08-23).  This POST already carries per-row attributes another way:
    :func:`~app.schemas.validation.statements._creation_items` keys them by row
    id IN THE FIELD NAME (``destination-<line_id>``,
    ``envelope_name-<line_id>``), assembled by scanning prefixed keys -- so
    ``match-<i>-row-<kind>-<id>-figure`` and ``-version`` was available, needs
    no format of its own, and cannot desynchronise because the key IS the
    identity.  **What decided it is that a match names N rows where a creation
    names one line.**  Under the keyed shape the row SET is implied by which
    keys happen to be present, so a body carrying a figure with no version, or
    a version with no figure, is expressible and has to be refused by a rule
    reconciling two prefixes; here one field per row is atomic and its absence
    is simply a row not named.  The cost is this module's own format, its
    parser and their controls, which is a real cost honestly paid rather than
    an obvious win.

    **It names no OWNER and no ACCOUNT**, for the reason
    :class:`~._creations.PurchaseCreation` states: whose account this is, is
    the :class:`~._scope.ReviewScope`'s, and a second statement of it could
    disagree with the scope the rows were priced from.

    Attributes:
        line_ids: The bank lines to explain.  They carry no reviewed state,
            and the reason is narrower than it looks: ``posted_on`` and
            ``amount`` are a line's IDENTITY in
            ``statement_import._record._fresh_lines``, which pairs an incoming
            line against a recorded one by exactly those, so neither can move
            under an open review.  What a re-import DOES write is the NULL
            provenance columns it can fill.

            **One of those feeds a write, and finding N-338 owns it.**
            ``transaction_on`` filled from ``NULL`` moves
            :attr:`~._offers.MatchDays.happened_on`, which
            :func:`~._offers.corrected_purchase_day` writes onto a matched
            purchase's ``purchased_on`` -- the one write releasing a match
            cannot undo.  It is the LINE-side twin of **N-336** and is
            deliberately NOT fixed here: whether a re-import should invalidate
            an open review is a ruling, not an omission, and the row's own
            remedy column carries the options.  What is bounded is the blast
            radius -- ``posted_first`` cannot move, so WHETHER a purchase is
            re-dated is stable and only the day it moves TO can shift.
        rows: The app rows that explain them, each as the screen showed it.
        accepted_difference: The DIFFERENCE the screen showed and the owner
            agreed to, or ``None`` where they agreed to none -- which is every
            proposal the app itself offers (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6d-4``,
            ruling **R-FN**).

            **Named for the CONSENT rather than for the row**, because it
            gates both of the two things a difference can become: the bank's
            figure written to the one row a match names, and
            :class:`~._accept.AcceptedMatch`'s ``residual`` -- the
            uncategorized row a GROUP's leftover becomes.  Calling it
            ``residual`` here made one word mean two things in one call
            chain, on the two sides of a money gate.

            **It is the one thing on this class that is not per-row, and that
            is exactly why it has to travel.**  Every other precondition here
            is reconciled by
            :func:`~._resolve._reject_moved_since_review`, which compares each
            ROW against the state the screen described -- so no per-row figure
            can drift between render and Apply.  The difference is arithmetic
            the BROWSER performed over those rows, and no per-row guard can see
            that arithmetic being wrong: a page that says ``-0.06`` over a door
            that writes ``-1,006.00`` is finding **N-336** one tier up.
            :func:`~._variance.reject_unrecordable` is what reconciles it.

            Like everything else here it is a PRECONDITION and never a payload:
            the figure the door writes is its own
            (:attr:`~._variance.MatchSides.difference`), derived inside the
            same transaction from the rows the ids name.
        attributed_to: The member the owner said the difference BELONGS to, as
            the screen showed that row, or ``None`` where they named none
            (plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-3a``).

            **It is a POINTER into** :attr:`rows` **rather than a second copy
            of a row**, and that is why it carries the whole reviewed value
            instead of a bare ``(kind, row_id)``: a subject key would state
            half of a row this submission already states whole, and the two
            halves could then disagree about the figure the attribution was
            chosen against.  Held to be one of :attr:`rows` by
            :func:`~._resolve.resolve_rows`, so the pointer is exact --
            equality over a frozen value, which compares the figure and the
            revision too, so an option rendered against a stale row is refused
            by the same guard that refuses the row.

            **``None`` is what every surface but the Reconcile card's MATCH
            pane sends, and it means what it always meant**: a match naming
            several rows and no member has nothing to say which one the
            difference belongs to, so it becomes **R-FN**'s ordinary accepted
            row.  A match naming ONE row does not need it -- ruling
            **R-GD(a)**'s determinacy answers it -- which is why the pane
            renders the control only where there are several
            (:class:`~._variance.DifferenceLanding`).

"""The MATCH pane of ONE card: the rows it offers, and what the ticked ones come to.

Plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-1``, ruling **bank_import:R-KA**.  **One producer
for a pane two surfaces render**: the live fragment
(``accounts.statement_reconcile_match``) re-derives it on every tick and every
keystroke of the search, and the Reconcile PAGE derives it for the one card a
scriptless request named with ``?open=<line_id>``.  A second assembly would be
two places for a ticked row to be dropped on the way to a door that MOVES
MONEY.

**HOW FAR IT REACHES IS THE CALLER'S FACT** (:class:`MatchReach`), and ruling
**R-BI1** is what decides it (developer, 2026-09-05).  It SUPERSEDES **R-KA**'s
row-set half rather than filling a gap R-KA left: that ruling DID settle the
reach, at the line's own pay period -- *one card is at most 15 rows* -- and
this is the override rather than an answer to an open question.

The scripted pane opens on the line's own pay period and the
SEARCH reaches the rest, which is what keeps a 27-card page off finding
**N-374**; the scriptless render has no search at all, so a period-bounded list
is a bound the owner cannot widen -- which is the cap **N-374** refused.  The
measurement that decides it is :mod:`._panel`'s own (2026-08-30): all 9 of the
9 card payments on the developer's Checking have payback rows their own period
does NOT hold, so the class **R-KA** exists to give an act back is exactly the
class a period-bounded list cannot serve.  The cost is bounded, and it is a
RANGE rather than a figure: rendering this pane's own candidate-row loop body
2026-09-05 gives **570 bytes** for a row with a 30-character label and no
``not_shown_alone`` badge, and about **760** for one carrying that badge, whose
sentence varies.  So 67 unexplained rows on ONE card is roughly **40 KB**,
against the 143,298 bytes **R-KA** rejected for every card's period rows -- and
paid only on a request that exists because the owner asked for that card.

*A first draft of this paragraph quoted one figure and then "reconciled" it
against R-KA's by dividing 143,298 by that render's 311 row renders.  That
arithmetic is wrong and the agreement it manufactured was worth nothing: the
143,298 is the byte total of the PANES, each of which also carries a trigger
wrapper, a search box, a sums block and a consent block, so the quotient is not
a per-row rate at all.  Adversarial review 2026-09-05.*

**EVERY TICKED ROW THE PASS STILL OFFERS IS RENDERED, whatever list this
render is otherwise showing**, and that is not a courtesy: a checkbox that is
not in the document is not submitted.  Without it, ticking a search result and
then searching again takes the first pick silently out of the act -- so a card
payment could not be grouped against two paybacks found by two searches, which
is the very act this module exists to make reachable.  The same hole is what
would make :attr:`MatchReach.EVERY_ROW` unsafe on a browser that DOES have
scripting: it would render all 67, and the first re-price would swap in the
period's 15 and drop whatever the owner had ticked outside them.

**The qualifier is exact and the residue is answered rather than hidden.**  A
submitted row the pass no longer offers -- one another act claimed between two
renders, or a crafted id -- is in no list this walks, so it renders nowhere;
:func:`~._resolve.resolve_rows` refuses that body by name and
:attr:`OpenedMatch.totals` carries the sentence, which is the door's own answer
rather than a silent drop.

**A CLAIM ELSEWHERE USED TO REST ON A MECHANISM THIS MODULE REMOVES, and plan
step ``bank_import:X-gp`` made it structural instead** (ruling **R-BI2**,
superseding **R-IV**).  Until then
:func:`~._variance._reject_unaccepted_difference` argued that a consent ticked
against one remedy and submitted under another was unconstructible BECAUSE the
attribution select's change re-rendered the box unticked -- and nothing swaps
anything on the ``?open=`` render, so this pane held it only on the narrower
ground that no proposal a tier offers is a group with a difference, which
``bank_import:X-gn`` would have re-armed.  The consent is ONE value now, the
figure and the member together (:class:`~._submission.ReviewedDifference`), so
there is no second field for any render to pair differently and X-gn owes the
guard nothing.  **What scripting off cannot do is consent to a set the render
never priced, and the PRESS is what prices it** (plan step
``bank_import:X-gi-2a``, finding **BI-478**).  The ``?open=`` render prices
the proposal's rows and draws the one act for them, so a tier's near miss IS
corrected from this page; a group the owner builds by hand here is priced only
when Apply is pressed, and the door refuses a difference nothing has consented
to.  Until X-gi-2a that refusal re-drew the pane from the PROPOSAL -- the
page's builder handed it the line id and nothing else -- so every tick the
owner had made was gone and, on a card no tier proposed, the pane came back at
`$0.00`.  It is drawn from the SUBMITTED form now (:class:`OpenedAsk`), so the
refusal comes back with the rows ticked, both totals, and the acts the
difference can become; the second press carries the consent.  That is what
this pane's copy says.

**THE RE-DRAWN FORM ECHOES WHAT WAS SUBMITTED, FOR EVERY CONTROL WHOSE VALUE
IS STILL ON OFFER** (ruling **bank_import:R-BI3**, developer 2026-09-11).  A
submitted row renders ticked where the pass still offers it, and a submitted
consent renders picked where an option's WHOLE value -- the figure and the
member's reviewed row token -- equals it (:attr:`OpenedMatch.consent`).  That
is not the pre-selection ruling **R-IU** forbids: the app picks nothing, it
echoes the owner's own tick, and the value it echoes is one the server
spelled.  A row tick that moves the difference leaves no option carrying the
old value, so the pick clears exactly when the act it consented to is no
longer the act on offer -- and survives a search keystroke, which changes no
act at all.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in, a
frozen dataclass out, no Flask import.  It READS and never writes --
:func:`~._preview.preview_hand_build` is the accept door's own reads and
refusals without the writes.

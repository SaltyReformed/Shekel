"""What a SUBMISSION names, resolved under the pass's own scope.

:mod:`._accept` writes a match; this decides what a match may be written
ABOUT.  The seam is that module's own, stated there in prose since plan step
``bank_import:X-f6a-3c-2`` -- *resolving and recording are two acts* -- and
made structural here at ``bank_import:X-f6d-3``, when the reconciliation
finding **N-336** asks for took the file past its line cap.  Nothing moved
across it: :func:`resolve_rows` called nothing in the write half and the write
half calls nothing here, so the split is the call graph's own shape.

**SEVEN refusals live here and they share one subject**: whether what a body
sent is what this pass could have offered.  Three are about the LINES -- a
line this account does not hold, one another match has claimed, and one the
owner has already SKIPPED (plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4a``) -- and four
about the ROWS: a row this pass could not offer or can no longer price, one
subject named twice, a row that has MOVED since the screen described it, and
an ATTRIBUTION naming a row the submission does not carry (plan step
``bank_import:X-gj-3a``).
The refusals in :mod:`._accept` are about the submission's SHAPE instead -- an
empty side, a parent matched beside its own child -- and the ones in
:mod:`._variance` are about the two sides DISAGREEING, which since plan step
``bank_import:X-f6d-4`` includes the figure that is not the row's to state.

*(This module's count is stated because this arc has shipped a taxonomy that
did not add up before; if an eighth refusal is added here, this sentence is
what has to change with it.  It read SIX until plan step
``bank_import:X-gj-4a`` added the skip, which is the count moving with the
predicate rather than a reader being left to re-count.  No count is claimed
for the other module, which owns its own.)*

**The security property is the SCOPE** and it did not change: an id is looked
up in the pass's own offer set (:class:`~._scope.ReviewScope`), never queried
directly, so a row belonging to another user, another account, a
non-contributing row, a card purchase or a row another match has claimed is
not a candidate and cannot be reached by crafting a request.

**The row lock every DOOR of this package takes on a bank line lives here
too**, since plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-5``: its MODE is stated once in
:func:`locked_for_write` (ruling **bank_import:R-BI5**), its ORDER once in
the query :func:`load_lines` and :func:`lock_lines` share, so a door's own
locked read and the pass's up-front one cannot come to take the same rows in
two orders (finding **N-471**), and since plan step ``bank_import:X-gv`` its
REFRESH beside the mode, so a row a door reads under the lock is the row the
lock holds rather than the one the pass hydrated before it (finding
**BI-493**).  The writers OUTSIDE the package -- a re-import's UPDATE of a
recorded line, an import delete's cascade -- are named on :func:`_lines_on`
and :func:`lock_lines`, one composed with and one not.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in,
frozen dataclasses out, no Flask import.  It READS and never writes; a lock is
a read's claim on the row, not a write.

    **``FOR NO KEY UPDATE``, and the mode is stated here ONCE** (ruling
    **bank_import:R-BI5**, plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-5``).  Both halves of
    ruling **R-HP**'s *exactly one verb* are app-tier reads across two tables
    -- :func:`load_lines` asks whether a SKIP answers the line, and
    :func:`~._skipping.skip_line` asks whether a MATCH does -- and write
    transactions run at ``READ COMMITTED`` (:mod:`app.db_transaction`), so
    two tabs otherwise interleave into a line carrying BOTH answers with
    nothing raising.  No key can catch it, because the pair spans two tables.
    What both writers share is the bank line row itself, which both of their
    foreign keys reference, so each locks it BEFORE reading the other table
    and the two serialise on the one row they have in common.

    **Why this mode and not its neighbours.**  Not ``FOR KEY SHARE``: that is
    what an ordinary foreign-key insert already takes implicitly, and two of
    those are compatible with each other, so it would serialise nothing.  Not
    ``FOR UPDATE``: it also blocks the ``FOR KEY SHARE`` a foreign-key check
    takes, so it would hold up an unrelated writer referencing the same line
    for no benefit, and it is the strength
    :mod:`app.services.credit_workflow` argues would deadlock against exactly
    those checks.  ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` conflicts with itself, which is the
    whole of what the exclusivity needs.  Named by adversarial security
    review 2026-09-02.

    **The flag is ``key_share=True``, and stating it is the point of this
    function.**  SQLAlchemy renders ``with_for_update(key_share=True)`` as
    ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` and ``key_share=False`` -- the default, and what
    BOTH sites passed from plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4a`` until this one --
    as the stronger ``FOR UPDATE``, so the two docstrings that argued the
    paragraph above each sat over a statement doing the other thing, and no
    test read the emitted text.  The compiled statement is what
    ``tests/test_services/test_statement_match/test_lock_order.py`` grades.
    One helper rather than a flag at each site is what stops the inversion
    coming back at the next site: :func:`load_lines`, :func:`lock_lines` and
    :func:`~._skipping._line_on` all take the lock through here, and nothing
    in this package spells ``with_for_update`` on a bank line itself.

    **It REFRESHES the instance it hands back, and that is the other half of
    what the lock is for** (finding **BI-493**, plan step ``bank_import:X-gv``).
    A press carrying creations runs :func:`~._reads.review_set` before
    :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed`, in the one ``READ COMMITTED``
    transaction the request is, and that derivation reads every undisposed
    line into the session's identity map, unlocked.  The locked ``SELECT`` a
    door then runs fetches the row the lock holds -- and without
    ``populate_existing()`` the ORM handed back the instance it already held,
    unrefreshed, because it populates only the attributes an existing
    instance has NOT loaded.  The one concurrent writer of a recorded line
    is a re-import's NULL-fill
    (``statement_import._record._absorb_gained_facts``: running balance,
    source category, external id, transaction day, merchant), and two of
    those columns reach every door's decision: ``merchant_id`` is the rule
    lookup at the create and income doors, the deposit's category placement
    at the income door and the skip door's account-payment refusal (ruling
    **R-JI**); ``transaction_on`` is the day the create door files the
    purchase on and, through :meth:`~._offers.MatchDays.of`, the day the
    match door re-dates a purchase to (ruling **R-FW**).  *A first draft of
    this sentence named two doors; the neutral review counted four, and an
    enumeration a reader takes as complete has to be.*
    ``populate_existing()`` overwrites every column from the
    locked row and re-runs the joined ``merchant`` load, so ``merchant_name``
    is the row's too; a change pending on the instance is flushed before the
    statement runs (the session autoflushes), so the row read back holds it.
    It composes HERE rather than at each site for the reason the mode does:
    a locked read written next year inherits it by calling this.  On
    :func:`lock_lines` it is vacuous by construction -- that read selects
    the id column alone and hydrates no instance, so there is nothing for it
    to hand back stale -- and the doors' own reads, which are what hand a
    row to a door, are where it acts.  The precedent one table over is
    :func:`app.services.credit_workflow.lock_source_transaction_for_payback`,
    for the same trap on ``status_id``.  Graded by
    ``tests/test_services/test_statement_match/test_locked_read_refresh.py``,
    which reproduced the stale read on the tree before this step: the skip
    landed on a line whose merchant now paid an account the owner holds, and
    a purchase was filed on its posting day over a stated transaction day.

    (plan step ``bank_import:X-gi-5``): ascending by ``id``.
    :func:`load_lines` reads through it per act and :func:`lock_lines` reads
    through it once per PASS, and sharing the query rather than the sentence
    is what makes the two orders one.  Two spellings that agree today are
    still two spellings (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).

    **``id`` and not ``(posted_on, id)``, which this read ordered by until
    that step, because the order has to compose with the other ORDERED
    writer of these rows and only ``id`` does.**  A re-import fills what a later export
    states and the recorded line does not
    (``statement_import._record._absorb_gained_facts``, the five columns
    :func:`locked_for_write` names), and the ORM flushes a mapper's UPDATEs sorted
    by PRIMARY KEY (``sqlalchemy.orm.persistence._sort_states``), so that
    transaction takes its row locks in id order.  Ids are not monotone in
    posted day across imports -- a fresher export inserts a finalized swipe
    into an earlier day's block -- so a pass ordered by day held a later-id
    line while wanting an earlier one that the re-import held: the cycle one
    order over.  Named by adversarial design review 2026-09-12.  ``id`` also
    rests on nothing that can move; a day order held only while no writer
    ever changed ``posted_on``.  Nothing reads the returned list's order:
    every consumer sums it, takes its ``max`` or ``min``, or iterates to
    insert.

    **The ORDER BY is what orders the LOCKS, and that is PostgreSQL's
    documented behaviour rather than an assumption**: a locking ``SELECT``
    applies ``ORDER BY`` first and then takes each row's lock as the ordered
    rows are returned -- the plan is ``LockRows`` above the ordering node,

    :func:`~._skipping._line_on`, and each of those reads is ordered -- but
    :func:`~._batch.apply_reviewed` runs a door per ITEM across four arms, so
    a pass took its locks in the order the SUBMISSION listed them, one
    ordered read at a time.  Two concurrent presses naming the same lines in
    different arms took them in opposite orders, PostgreSQL detected the
    cycle and aborted one mid-batch: the loser's whole press rolled back and
    was answered with the generic *Something went wrong* sentence
    (:func:`~app.routes.accounts._statement_doors.run_statement_fragment_door`
    catches the database error) over an ERROR-level traceback.
    **Reproduced 2026-09-12** with a forced interleave: press A recording a
    LATE line then skipping an EARLY one, press B the reverse, each paused
    after its first lock -- A died ``DeadlockDetected`` and B landed both.

    **This reads every line the batch names ONCE, in :func:`_lines_on`'s
    order, before any arm runs.**  A row lock is held by the TRANSACTION --
    outside every item's savepoint, so a refused item's rollback releases
    the door's re-take and not this -- and a door's own locked read a moment
    later re-takes a lock it already holds and blocks on nothing; the order
    two presses take their line locks in is therefore this read's, which is
    the same for both, and they queue on the first line they share instead
    of crossing.  The doors keep their own locks: each is still safe called
    on its own, and a pass carrying a line this read could not lock -- one
    another account holds -- reaches the door's own refusal for it, one
    item, with the rest still landing.

    **It changes no item's order and no savepoint's** -- a solo press's
    receipt is byte-identical, which the ledger row's remedy sentence had
    wrong (*it changes which savepoint runs first*): that would be true of
    SORTING the items, which is not the remedy.  What moves is WHEN a press
    that must wait does so: before its first item rather than part-way
    through, so every line the batch names is held for the whole pass, and a
    pair that would have deadlocked on a SHARED LINE now ends as one press
    landing and the other's items on that line landing as repeats or
    refusing as already answered.

    **What it does not remove is every other lock a pass takes**, and the
    claim above is scoped to the lines on purpose.  An item that settles a
    row locks ``budget.transactions`` and, through the posting sync, takes
    the per-user advisory lock, which is then held to commit -- so two presses
    of one owner sharing NO line, or a press against a concurrent settle,
    can still cross on those (finding **N-193**'s class, owner
    ``balance:X-bn``), and an import DELETE cascades through these rows in
    the referential trigger's own scan order, which no ``ORDER BY`` of ours
    composes with.  This read closes the cycle on the BANK LINES, which is
    the one this door created by locking per item.

    **It takes the lock under the account FILTER**, so ids the pass has no
    business with lock nothing, and it returns nothing: what a door needs to
    know about a line it reads for itself under the same lock -- and that
    read is the one :func:`locked_for_write` refreshes, since this one
    selects the id column alone and hydrates no instance it could hand back
    stale (plan step ``bank_import:X-gv``).  An empty set emits no statement
    at all, which is the ordinary untouched-form press.

    **The per-user advisory lock is not taken here, and when
    ``balance:X-bn`` brings it to this door it goes ABOVE this read**: that
    step's invariant is that the advisory lock is a transaction's FIRST lock,
    and this is the pass's first ROW lock.  Taking the advisory lock at one
    door ahead of that step would put this door's order against every door
    it has not reached yet, which is the cycle finding **N-193** records.

    had grown its own copy of it.  Two implementations of "is this line on this
    account, and has something already claimed it" is two places for the
    refusal to stop firing.

    **A line the owner has SKIPPED is refused for the same reason one match
    holds** (plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4a``, ruling **bank_import:R-HP**):
    a bank line ends on exactly ONE of the four verbs, and
    :func:`~._skipping.skip_line` refuses the mirror -- a line a live match
    answers may not also be skipped.  **Without this half the exclusivity is
    one-directional**, and the state it admits is silent: the line carries a
    match AND a skip, so it renders a card on the Explained tab and another on
    the Skipped tab, is absent from the inbox for two independent reasons, and
    nothing raises.  No key can hold it -- the rule spans two tables -- which
    is the position ``accept_match``'s balance refusal is already in.

    *The two-cards half of that sentence was written at ``X-gj-4a`` and was
    FALSE until plan step ``bank_import:X-gj-4c-2``*: the Skipped tab then held
    the lines a standing *never a purchase* answer barred rather than recorded
    skips, so such a line rendered on Explained and nowhere else.  It is true
    now, and it is MEASURED rather than asserted --
    ``test_reconcile.TestADoublyAnsweredLineIsTHECOSTTwoRefusalsBUY`` builds
    the match through the real door at a moment when no skip exists, then
    inserts the SKIP row at the ORM tier -- so only the second answer is
    planted, which is the half this refusal owns.  *An earlier draft said
    "past both doors"; only one is bypassed, and the resulting STATE is the
    thing neither door would allow.*  Recorded
    because a justification written ahead of the surface it describes reads,
    to the next reader, exactly like one that was checked.

    **Asked HERE and not in the three doors**, because this function is
    already the one statement of *is this line on this account, and has
    anything claimed it*: the paragraph above says two implementations of that
    question is two places for it to stop firing, and a third door written next
    year inherits this one by calling it.

    Args:
        account_id: The account the match is for.
        line_ids: The submitted ids.
        matched: What this account's matches have already claimed, read by the
            ACT rather than queried here -- so a batch's fourth item sees the
            lines its third item claimed.
        for_write: Whether the caller is about to WRITE a match, which decides
            whether the lines are read under a row lock.  **Keyword-only and
            with NO DEFAULT**, because the value that reads as safe is the
            wrong one in both directions: defaulting to ``True`` makes a
            PREVIEW fail, and defaulting to ``False`` makes a DOOR race.  The
            three write doors pass ``True``;
            :func:`~._preview.preview_hand_build` passes ``False``, and it is
            the only caller that may -- it exists to run this door's reads and
            refusals WITHOUT its writes.
            **A preview must not lock, and that is measured rather than
            stylistic**: a query request runs inside a
            ``REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY`` transaction

    **The scope is a PARAMETER, the claims are re-read per act, and the FIGURE
    is re-derived per act** (plan step X-f6a-3c-2).  This function derived the
    whole account itself until that step, at 3.593 s a call on the developer's
    own data, which is 12.88 minutes to work one statement's 215 acts.  What
    made the derivation shareable is that its parts move at different rates:

    * WHICH rows exist and may be offered cannot change while a pass runs, so
      that is derived once and arrives on *scope*.  It is also the expensive
      half -- an 827-row scan -- and the security-bearing one;
    * WHICH of them are already spoken for changes with every item, so that is
      the *matched* argument, re-read by every act;
    * WHAT one is WORTH can be moved by a SIBLING act, so it is re-derived here
      through :func:`~._candidates.repriced`.

    **That third bullet replaces an argument adversarial financial review
    measured FALSE on 2026-08-19.**  The claim was that only a parent/child
    pairing can move a figure another item names, and that
    :func:`_reject_parent_and_its_own_purchase` refuses it.  But settling a
    matched purchase runs ``entry_service.update_entry``, which re-derives the
    envelope's CC Payback through ``sync_entry_payback`` and WRITES its
    ``estimated_amount`` -- and that payback is a candidate on the same
    account, a SIBLING of the purchase rather than its parent, invisible to
    that guard.  Measured: a `$60.00` payback dropping to `$50.00` mid-pass,
    with the second match accepted against the stale `$60.00` and the ledger
    booking `$50.00` for a `-$60.00` bank line.  Re-pricing is total where an
    enumeration of sibling writers is one writer from being wrong again.

        submission: What the owner accepted.
        scope: The pass's derived offer set.

            act.

    Returns:
        The candidates the submission names, transactions first, priced as they
        stand NOW.

    Raises:
        ValidationError: When an id names nothing the screen could have
            offered, names a row another match has since claimed, or names one
            that can no longer be priced at all.

    **Finding N-336, and it is the one refusal here that is about the SCREEN
    rather than about the row.**  Every guard beside it asks whether an act is
    legal; this asks whether it is the act the owner reviewed.  Ruling
    **R-FP** -- *a match is a PROPOSAL, never a silent apply* -- is only true
    of the shipped app if something compares the two moments, and until this
    step nothing did: the screen offered *from ``-178.32`` to ``-178.29``*, the
    row was edited to ``500.00`` in another tab, and this door wrote a
    **``$321.71``** correction under that caption.

    **It runs AFTER the re-pricing rather than instead of it.**  The two answer
    different questions and both are needed: :func:`~._candidates.repriced`
    makes the write correct against the database as it stands NOW (finding
    **N-309**), and this makes the write one the owner agreed to.  A door with
    only the first writes a correct number nobody saw; a door with only the
    second writes a reviewed number that is stale.

    **It fails CLOSED, which is what the exact tier used to do by accident.**
    An equal match whose price moved became UNEQUAL and was refused by
    :func:`~._variance.reject_unrecordable`'s predecessor (**R-FV**);
    ``X-f6d-2`` made
    an unequal one-to-one recordable and that accident stopped protecting
    anything.  So this refuses on ANY movement, in either direction, on either
    coordinate -- not only where a correction would be written.  A match whose

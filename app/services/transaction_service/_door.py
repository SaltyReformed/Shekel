"""
Shekel Budget App -- Transaction Service: what a DOOR's requested status means

The route layer's ONE status entry point.  A door states the status the USER
asked for; :func:`apply_requested_status` decides what applying it means --
dispatching a settle to the verb, and reconciling the posted ledger either way.
What a REVERT undoes is the status seam's, in one statement with the status
itself (plan step X-au-c3): leaving the settled band releases the whole
settlement record.

**It exists because a ROUTE was making that decision, and making it wrong**
(finding **N-219**, plan step X-ap): the transaction PATCH handler called the
status seam directly, so marking a row Paid from the full-edit popover flipped
the status without asking what the row was WORTH.

Flask-isolated: plain data and ORM rows in, mutations applied in place, no
``request`` / ``session`` imports, no commit.

    """Apply the status a DOOR requested, and reconcile the ledger to it.

    **The route layer's ONE status entry point, and the reason it exists is
    that a route was deciding what a status change MEANS.**  The transaction
    PATCH handler and the cancel handler each called
    ``status_seam.apply_status_change`` directly -- the MECHANICS primitive,
    which verifies the transition, assigns the column and maintains the settle
    day, and deliberately does nothing else.  For "the user cancelled this row"
    the mechanics ARE the whole act.  For "the user marked this row Paid" they
    are not: settling also decides what the row is WORTH
    (:func:`._settle.settle_transaction`), and a door that flips the status without
    asking books whatever figure the row happened to be carrying.  That is
    finding **N-219** on the transaction PATCH door, and the shape of it is a
    ROUTE holding a money rule -- this arc's own root cause 1.

    So the routes stop choosing.  A door states the status the USER asked for
    and this decides what applying it means.  After plan step X-ap the only
    ``app/`` callers of the seam are this function, :func:`._settle.settle_transaction`,
    :func:`._settle.settle_from_entries`, ``credit_workflow`` (Credit and its revert,
    neither of them settled statuses) and ``transfer_service._status`` (a transfer and
    its two shadows, which settle through ``transfer_service`` by transfer
    invariants 3 and 4) -- so a FOURTH transaction settle door cannot be opened
    by reaching for the obvious primitive, which is how the third one was.

    **The ledger reconcile is here rather than at each door** for the reason
    :func:`._settle.settle_transaction` states for its own: every status change moves
    the row's posted effect (a settle posts it, a cancel reverses it), and a
    door that forgets posts nothing while reporting success.  It is reconciled
    LAST, after the caller's own field writes, so it reads the final amount and
    category rather than the pre-edit ones -- the discipline
    ``transfer_service.update_transfer`` documents.  A caller that edits
    posting-relevant fields WITHOUT changing the status still owes its own
    reconcile; there is no status change for this function to hang one on.

    Does NOT flush or commit -- the caller owns the session boundary.

    Args:
        txn: The transaction whose status the door is changing.  Must be a
            REGULAR row: a transfer shadow's status is its parent's
            (``transfer_service.update_transfer``), and the PATCH route branches
            a shadow away before it reaches here.
        new_status_id: The ``ref.statuses.id`` the door asked for -- the
            SUBMITTED status when the form carried one, else the row's own (an
            edit that changes only the settle day is an identity transition).
        settle_day: The civil day the money moved and HOW that day is known
            (:class:`app.services.settle_day.SettleDay`), when the door knows
            it, after the door's own
            :func:`app.services.status_seam.settle_day_for_status` reading of
            the submission -- which is what stamps the ``entered`` basis on a
            day that came out of a date box.  ``None`` leaves the seam's rule in
            force.
        submitted: The figure a HUMAN supplied, when the door collected one.
            Read only by the SETTLE arm, which decides whether it is a
            correction to record; ``None`` means nobody typed one, and the
            settle records what it resolved instead.  Every other status change
            ignores it, because a figure records what MOVED and nothing else
            here moves money.

    Raises:
        ValidationError: From an illegal transition or the seam's settle-day
            refusals.  A 400 at the route.
        PostingError: From the reconcile, on a broken ledger invariant.
            Deliberately NOT a sibling of ``ValidationError`` -- it must fail
            loud rather than render as a designed refusal.

    # Paid -> Settled (the archive) while carrying a corrected figure recorded
    # the figure, returned, and left the row Paid, answering 200.  The archive
    # is offered by the popover's own Status dropdown beside the Actual box, so
    # a user correcting a figure on the way to filing the row away silently got
    # only half of what they asked for.  The revert direction failed the same
    # way one step further out: a service caller reverting a settled row while
    # naming a figure recorded it, posted the ledger difference, and never
    # reverted -- booking money for a row it had just been told had not moved.
    #
    # The cause was treating a CORRECTION and a STATUS CHANGE as alternatives.
    # They are independent facts, and the seam already takes both in one call
    # -- which is what makes "a settled row states what moved" its property
    # rather than a convention each door keeps.  Composing them also collapses
    # what used to be two ledger reconciles into the one this function always
    # promised.
    #
    # **A figure on a row STAYING in the settled band is a CORRECTION to what
    # it recorded**, and it is applied rather than refused (developer ruling,
    # 2026-08-17).  The estimate and the actual are two different facts about a
    # row and get two different boxes: editing the estimate is a budget
    # decision and touches nothing that moved, and editing the actual states
    # what the bank really took.  Correcting a figure therefore does not
    # require reverting the row -- which matters beyond convenience, because
    # revert-then-re-settle was the ONLY path and it silently re-booked a
    # retained correction over a re-planned amount.
    #
    # This function used to own the other half of the revert too, clearing an
    # envelope's derived ``actual_amount`` through ``_release_derived_actual``
    # while deliberately sparing a bill's correction, because the two shared a
    # column and only a predicate could tell them apart.  They no longer share
    # one, and the predicate went with the sharing: nothing here is released BY
    # KIND, because nothing here is released at all.

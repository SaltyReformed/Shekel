"""The MOVEMENT posting sources: a row's purchases and covering movements as cash.

Ruling **R-FM** (plan step X-f3b), whose whole content is one sentence: *a
purchase that has cleared the bank is a cash posting, and its envelope's close
books only what its purchases did not*.  This module is that source's write
half -- what makes a movement postable, what its two legs are, and the
reconcile-to-target emission for one of them.  Since plan step
``balance:X-bi-3b`` a bill's or a paycheck's covering movement posts through
it too (a movement's legs are its parent's, ruling **R-BAL35**), and since
``balance:X-bi-6-3`` so does a transfer's (ruling **R-BAL101**): ONE
movement writer, the COUNTER LEG dispatched by the parent's shape.  A row's
movement books against the row's category under the ``purchase`` source; a
transfer LEG's books against the owner's Transfers-in-transit account under
the ``transfer_movement`` source with the ``transfer`` leg kind (ruling
**R-BAL45**'s shape C: two entries per settled transfer, each side on its own
bank day, the transit account netting to zero once both have cleared).  The
parent is what :func:`app.services.transfer_legs.movement_parent` resolves
(leaf ``X-bi-6-4a``): a plan row, or a transfer's leg, never the shadow row
a transfer movement still hangs off.

**Why a module of its own rather than more of :mod:`app.services.posting_service`.**
The purchase was a THIRD posting source beside the transfer and the transaction,
with its own concrete linkage (``journal_entries.transaction_entry_id``), its
own source kind (``ref.posting_sources`` ``purchase``), its own target rule and
its own day; the transfer movement shares the linkage, the rule and the day and
differs in the counter leg, the source kind and the leg kind alone.  Adding
the purchase inline took the writer module 319 lines past pylint's 1,000-line
ceiling; growing past a gate is a signal, and the seam the ceiling was
measuring is exactly this one.  The split follows the sibling-split
convention ``posting_reads`` was created by.

**It holds no public door, deliberately.**  The two doors a caller reaches --
``posting_service.sync_transaction_postings`` (the family reconcile, and since
plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a`` the whole of what an ordinary transaction posts)
and ``posting_service.reverse_purchase_postings_before_delete`` -- stay in the
writer module, because both must run the account anchor self-heal that module
owns, and because ``posting_service`` remains the ledger's ONE public surface.
What lives here is what those doors are made of.  (A per-purchase door,
``sync_purchase_postings``, stood beside them with zero callers until that
step deleted it -- ledger row **BAL-507**.)

**The dependency runs one way**: this module imports the balanced-write leaf
(:mod:`app.services._posting_write`) and the chart resolvers, and never
``posting_service`` itself -- the same direction, and for the same cycle
reason, that :mod:`app.services._posting_reconcile` keeps.

Flask-isolated and commit-free like its consumers: flushes so the caller sees
assigned ids; the caller owns the transaction boundary.

    The ONE statement of "is this purchase in the ledger" on the write side,
    and the twin of the read side's own three narrowings
    (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger._events.settled_cash_facts`).  All
    three are load-bearing and each is stated there in full:

    * the PARENT contributes to a balance at all (not soft-deleted, not Credit
      or Cancelled) -- :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg`'s
      totality rule, the family's since ruling **R-FM**;
    * the purchase is a DEBIT -- a card purchase leaves through its own CC
      Payback sibling and never touches this account;
    * its bank posting day is RECORDED -- the trigger itself.

    It reads no status of the parent beyond the contributing gate, deliberately:
    a purchase against a still-PROJECTED envelope has left the bank exactly as
    one against a closed envelope has.  The same three narrowings decide a
    transfer's covering movement (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``, ruling
    **R-BAL101**), which is what let ``sync_transfer_postings`` drop the
    ``settled`` flag it used to be told: a settle dates the movement and a
    revert un-dates it (ruling **R-BAL61**), so the movement's own state says
    whether its leg is in the ledger.

    **A transfer LEG posts its RECORD alone** (leaf ``X-bi-6-4a``): its gate
    is the TRANSFER's, read through the leg, so the fold's leg arm
    (``settled_cash_facts``) and this answer from one parent.  Through the
    interval a movement under a DEAD shadow of its transfer is no leg's
    record (:func:`app.services.transfer_legs.movement_parent` gives its leg
    none), so it posts nothing and any leg it holds reverses: the answer the
    dead shadow's own gate gave while the writer read the shadow, and the
    fold's.  No door writes that state (0 on the 2026-09-22 17:06 dump); the
    term answers ``True`` for every movement from ``X-bi-6-4d``, where each
    movement a side links is that side's record, and goes then.

    Args:
        parent: The movement's parent, as
            :func:`~app.services.transfer_legs.movement_parent` resolves it

            record when it is one.  A leg built without the movement
            (``transfer_legs.leg_of``, ``planned_transfer_legs``) carries no
            record, and this answers ``False`` for it -- a dated leg would
            silently reverse -- so every door resolves the parent through
            ``movement_parent`` and none hands the writer a leg of its own.

    """Return the debit-positive ledger target for a POSTED movement.

    The ONE ledger target a row's family has (plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-4a``, ruling **R-BAL80**: a plan row books nothing of its
    own, so the row-level ``_settled_target`` this was the analog of is
    gone): ``{cash_ledger_id: leg, counter_ledger_id: -leg}``, summing to
    zero by construction, where
    ``leg`` is :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg` -- the
    movement's whole figure in its PARENT's direction (ruling **R-BAL35**).
    A purchase against an envelope books ``{cash: -amount, category:
    +amount}`` exactly as it did; a paycheck's covering movement books
    ``{cash: +amount, category: -amount}`` into an INCOME-class counter
    account.  The direction was spelled here as ``-amount`` until that step,
    so an income parent could not be covered before it.

    **The counter leg is dispatched by the PARENT's shape, and that is the
    whole of what a transfer adds** (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``, rulings
    **R-BAL45** and **R-BAL101**).  A transfer LEG's covering movement
    books its cash leg on the movement's account -- ``-figure`` on the
    from-side, ``+figure`` on the to-side, the side the leg's (leaf
    ``X-bi-6-4a``; the shadow's type through ``X-bi-6-3``), through the same
    producer -- against the owner's Transfers-in-transit
    account rather than a category: a transfer between two of the owner's
    accounts is neither income nor expense, which is why the purchase source
    with its category counter was REJECTED for it at R-BAL45.  Worked on the
    production restore's transfer 53 (``$1,910.95`` Checking -> Mortgage,
    both movements 2026-04-01): ``{Checking -1,910.95, Transit +1,910.95}``
    and ``{Mortgage +1,910.95, Transit -1,910.95}``, the transit account
    netting to zero once both sides have cleared and each side free to post
    on its own bank day when the days part (the mirror ``X-bi-6-4`` deletes).

    **There is no sign branch HERE, and that is what makes a REFUND work**
    (ruling **bank_import:R-II**).  The rule is arithmetic rather than a case
    analysis over the figure, so a NEGATIVE purchase passes through it
    correctly: at ``-28.29`` under an expense it emits ``{cash: +28.29,
    category: -28.29}``, money coming back and a contra-expense, which is
    exactly what a merchant credit is.  Measured end-to-end on a production
    clone before the constraint moved, against a ``+28.29`` control that
    produced the mirror image.

    **The counter leg is the PARENT's own category, in the parent's class**
    (ruling **R-FM**, developer 2026-08-15; the class since X-bi-3b by
    :func:`~app.services._posting_write.ledger_class_of`).  A movement carries
    no category of its own, and the money it records is its parent's: booking
    it there recognises the expense or income in the right category on the
    day it happens.  Through ``X-bi-3e`` the parent's close then booked the
    remainder to the SAME account, so the two summed to the row's whole
    figure; since plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a`` the close books nothing, and
    a purchase not yet dated is in flight until it is (ruling **R-BAL77**).
    Rejected: booking it to Uncategorized until the close, which shows an
    open envelope's real spend as uncategorised on the income statement and
    makes every close write a reclassification pair.

    A re-category of the parent is therefore a re-category of its purchases, and
    it reconciles by the same mechanism the parent's own leg uses: the sync
    reads the OLD legs back from the ledger and reverses them
    (``routes/transactions/mutations`` lists ``category_id`` among the fields
    that raise a reconcile, on a Projected row as well as a settled one).

    Args:
        entry: The purchase.  Its ``account_id`` is the account its money
            moved THROUGH -- its own, and free to differ from its parent's
            since plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-1`` (ruling **R-BAL75**: the
            ledger, the fold and the self-heal all read the movement's) --
            so the cash account is read straight off it.
        parent: Its parent -- a plan row, or a transfer leg -- taken as an

            :func:`app.services.transfer_legs.movement_parent` -- pays no lazy
            load, and so every movement of one family is provably booked to
            one category.  Its ``user_id`` is the counter account's owner,
            the ONE home ``pay_calendar:C13-b`` gave a row's owner (a leg's is
            its transfer's): a parameter every caller binds from that home
            would be a second home one hop away.

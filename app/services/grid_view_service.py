"""
Shekel Budget App -- Grid View Service

Pure template-data producer for the budget grid.  Builds the sorted
row-key sequence (one entry per logical line item: a template-linked
group or a standalone name) and the
``(category_id, template_id, txn_name, period_id) -> [item]``
matching dict that drives every cell render, where an item is a
:class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` row or, since leaf
``X-bi-6-1`` (ruling **R-BAL87**), a :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs
.TransferLeg` -- one side of a transfer, drawn from the parent rather than
from a shadow row.  Every predicate here asks an item the questions both
shapes answer (``category_id``, ``status_id``, ``is_income``, ``recurs``,
``name``, ``pay_period_id``, ``due_date``); :func:`cell_key` is the one
place the two identities are told apart.

Single source of truth shared by:

  * the owner-facing grid (``app/routes/grid/page.py::index``), which
    consumes the dict from the desktop ``render_row_cells`` and the
    mobile ``render_row_card`` macros in
    ``app/templates/grid/_grid_row_macros.html``;
  * the companion view (``app/routes/companion.py::index``), which
    renders the shared ``grid/_mobile_this_period.html`` partial via
    the same macros (mobile-first v3 plan Commit 13 / D-B).

Architecture (per CLAUDE.md "Architecture" and
``docs/coding-standards.md``):

  * No Flask imports.  Takes plain SQLAlchemy collections and the
    ``RowKey`` shape; returns plain ``list[RowKey]`` and ``dict``.
  * No monetary arithmetic.  Status / category / income-vs-expense
    filtering only; every displayed dollar amount still flows through
    ``balance_resolver`` per mobile-first v3 plan Section 1 rule 2.
  * Cancelled-status filtering is routed through
    :func:`app.utils.balance_predicates.is_cancelled` so the Python
    producer and the Jinja templates' Cancelled-status guards share
    one cached-ID definition (E-15 / MED-02).

    Scans the supplied transactions and collects one row per logical

    template name -- this keeps historic instances whose stored ``name``
    predates a template rename from splitting into a second row.
    Every other row dedupes by (category_id, name) and labels itself with
    the instance name.  **The fork is ``recurs``, not the link** (ruling

    one-off renamed at the popover moves to a new row as a link-less
    rename did.  Results are sorted by (group_name, item_name, txn_name)
    for stable alphabetical ordering within each category group.

    The caller controls scope: passing only visible-window transactions
    produces the default compact view (rows only for items active in

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Shared Recurrence-Engine Helpers

Centralises the logic the transaction recurrence engine
(``app/services/recurrence_engine.py``) and the transfer recurrence
engine (``app/services/transfer_recurrence.py``) ran in byte-identical
form before each generated its own model-specific rows.  The two
engines are deliberate parallels (Transaction vs Transfer), so every
block that does not actually touch the model belongs here, in one
place, where the two cannot drift:

  - the cross-user ownership defense (:func:`check_scenario_ownership`),
  - what a template's rows already CLAIM (:class:`OccurrenceClaims`), the one
    query that reads it (:func:`rows_claiming`) and the generate decision
    both engines and the read-only predictor share
    (:func:`occurrences_to_write`),
  - the regenerate pass's whole DECISION -- which rows are the rule's to
    rewrite (:func:`owner_hold_on` / :func:`is_maintainable`), what one pass
    must do to each (:func:`classify_maintain_work` into
    :class:`MaintainWork`) and what it then did (:class:`MaintainOutcome`),
  - the regenerate row fetch (:func:`rows_this_pass_may_maintain`),
  - the regenerate pass's period-set query (:func:`_rows_in_periods`),
  - the cross-user audit ``log_event(...)`` blocks (the ``log_*`` helpers
    below).

**``partition_regeneration_rows`` is gone** (plan step R10-b).  It classified a
row for the DELETE-and-recreate regenerate machine -- conflict, immutable, or
"safe to delete and regenerate" -- and that third class was a premise both
engines have now dropped.  Plan step R10-a replaced it on the transaction side
(``transaction_entries`` CASCADE, so deleting a projected envelope destroyed the
owner's purchases); R10-b replaces it on the transfer side, where a delete took
the row's ``notes``, its id and any settlement record it had retained through a
revert.  What stands in its place is :func:`classify_maintain_work`, which both
engines share -- so the shared helper is the decision that MAINTAINS rather than
the one that partitioned them for destruction.

**``regeneration_bound`` is gone** (pay-calendar plan step C2-f3c).  It existed
because the regenerate sweep was an SQL bound on ``pay_periods.end_date``, so
"no lower bound" had to be turned into a concrete date before it could be
compared against a column -- and the date it had to become was the WRITE
WINDOW's opening, or the sweep reached rows the pass would not rewrite.  The
sweep now selects on a period-ID SET taken from the pass's own window, so
``None`` needs no translation and the domain cannot exceed the window in the
first place.  The asymmetry that helper closed by arithmetic is closed by the
shape.

What both engines TAKE rather than share -- the owner's pay calendar
and the window one pass writes into -- is
:class:`~app.services.generation_schedule.GenerationSchedule`, and it lives in
its own public module because the route layer constructs it too.  This module
is package-private (``shekel-private-module-import``), so a type a route must
name cannot live here.

The model-specific halves -- constructing a ``Transaction`` vs routing
a ``Transfer`` through ``transfer_service`` for shadow atomicity -- stay
in their respective engines.  The occurrence-matching preamble
(``resolve_generation_plan``) lives in ``recurrence_engine`` too, since
hoisting it here would create an import cycle -- the transfer engine imports
that module for it.

Keeping the audit-trail event names, message strings, and keyword
fields in one place is load-bearing for two reasons:

  1. **Forensic coherence.**  The Phase-6 audit's cross-user defense
     evidence trail depends on both engines emitting structurally
     identical events when an IDOR probe is blocked.  Drift between the
     two engines would show up as a missing or differently-shaped
     event in the SOC's alerting pipeline, which is exactly the
     regression class the testing-standards "Zero Tolerance" rule is
     designed to prevent.
  2. **DRY.**  Pylint R0801 flagged the duplicate blocks (one VERBATIM,
     one near-verbatim with only the literal message differing); a
     fix in one copy that forgets the other is the bug class the
     ``c-38-followups`` document calls out under Issue 1.

These helpers are deliberately thin wrappers around
``app.utils.log_events.log_event`` -- they exist to lock in the
event constant, category, and keyword shape, not to add behaviour.

    occurrence already answered?" -- and until this type they each asked a
    DIFFERENT one, about the pay PERIOD.  That is ledger row **D57**: a

    **A row is retained rather than changed in exactly two shapes**, and both
    are finding **N-292**: the rule no longer fires for this row's occurrence,
    or the definition has moved the ACCOUNTS the row's records are attributed
    to.  Neither is safe to apply silently, so the pass leaves the row exactly
    as it found it and asks.

    **"Still names it" is asked of the row's OCCURRENCE since plan step R17**,
    where it was asked of the row's pay PERIOD.  That is the same re-keying
    ledger row **D57** forced on the generate path, made here for the same
    reason: the period a row sits in is where its money lands, not what the row
    answers, and the owner can move it.  The developer ruled the consequence on
    2026-08-28 -- a row whose occurrence the rule has dropped is NOT named, so
    it retires when it carries nothing and is held back as a conflict when it
    carries the owner's records.  It is never silently re-pointed at whatever
    occurrence is left over in its paycheck: that is a deduction only if every
    row answers some occurrence, and a NULL ``occurs_on`` denies it -- the same
    invalid inference an adversarial review cut from ``stamp_occurrences.py``,
    where it paired a ``$12.34`` envelope roll-forward with a car payment nine
    paychecks away.

    **A NULL ``occurs_on`` row answers no occurrence, so it is never named.**
    Every such row on the developer's data is immutable (four ``Paid``, one
    ``Credit``; ``Projected`` is the only mutable status in ``ref.statuses``),
    so none reaches this branch today -- but a mutable one would retire, and
    that is the correct answer for a row no rule claims.

    **The claims that decide CREATE come from *claimants*, NOT from *existing*,
    and that distinction is ledger row D57 on this path.**  *existing* is a
    PERIOD set -- the pass's write window, bounded by its ``effective_from`` --
    and the row that answers an occurrence need not be in it: the owner may
    have moved that row to a paycheck the window does not reach.  An
    adversarial review of this leaf measured the consequence at the service
    seam, through the salary door (``routes/salary/_helpers`` regenerates with
    ``effective_from=date.today()``): a row moved back one paycheck left
    ``existing`` while its occurrence stayed named, and the create arm answered
    that occurrence a SECOND time -- silently where the moved row is still an
    override, and as an unhandled ``IntegrityError`` once the conflict chooser
    has cleared that flag.  :func:`rows_claiming` is period-unscoped for
    exactly this reason, and the generate path has consumed it from the start.

    **The retired rows are removed from the claimants first.**  A retired row
    stops holding anything, and a NULL-occurrence row holds its whole paycheck
    (:class:`OccurrenceClaims`) -- so reading the claims before the
    classification would let one row both block a write and be deleted in the
    same pass, leaving a period the rule names with no row at all.  Dated rows
    cannot produce that pairing (a retired row is one the rule stopped naming,
    so it never blocked a named occurrence), which is why the ordering only
    started mattering when NULL rows gained a claim.

    **Shared by both engines since plan step R10-b, over two ID SETS rather
    than a model.**  Every question this asks about a row is one both a
    Transaction and a Transfer answer identically, and the two that are NOT
    (what "records" means, and what "the definition moved the accounts" means,
    since a transfer has two of them) arrive already resolved as sets of ids.

    Args:
        selector: This pass's :class:`TemplateRowSelector` -- what
            :func:`rows_claiming` is asked about.  Taken rather than handed the
            claimants themselves, because "the rows that already answer these
            occurrences" and "the rows this pass may maintain" are two
            DIFFERENT reads that a caller could pair wrongly, and two values
            that have to agree is the shape this module exists to remove.
        existing: Every row of this template in the pass's WRITE WINDOW at
            or after its bound.  The window half is the load-bearing one:
            it is what keeps this domain a superset of the plan's, and so
            what makes the RETIRE branch reachable.  It decides CLASSIFICATION
            -- update, retire, retain -- and deliberately not creation.
        placements: The occurrences the rule names now -- this pass's
            ``recurrence_engine.PlannedOccurrence`` values, duck-typed on
            ``.occurrence`` and ``.period.period_id`` as everything else in
            this module is.  Empty for a template whose recurrence was
            CLEARED, which correctly makes every row an orphan.  It was a
            ``{period_id: occurs_on}`` map for one step, between plan step R17's
            two leaves; a map keyed by period cannot state two occurrences in
            one paycheck, which is exactly what the re-keyed index now stores.
        with_records: Ids of rows carrying the owner's own records, resolved by
            the engine from its own table -- purchases, a note, a settlement
            record or a statement link.
        reattributed: Ids of rows whose ACCOUNTS the definition has moved.

    Shared by both recurrence engines' ``regenerate_for_template`` to collect
    the rows eligible for the maintain / retire decision.  The only per-engine
    differences are the model class and the template foreign-key column, so
    both are parameters.

    **It selects on a period-ID SET, and the set is the pass's own write

    pay_periods.end_date >= :effective_from``.

    **This is a CUTOVER, not the repair of a divergence, and an adversarial
    review of C2-f3c is why that is said plainly.**  A first draft of this
    paragraph claimed the old select read the STORED end while
    ``resolve_generation_plan`` filtered the DERIVED one, and it was false:
    that function resolved the ORM row out of the write window BEFORE applying
    the bound, deliberately and with a comment saying so, precisely so both
    halves read the same stored column.  They agreed.  What C2-f3c does is move
    them BOTH onto the derived end, ahead of plan step **C4-c** dropping the
    column they agreed on -- and the reason that was safe is a separate
    invariant, not a bug being fixed: ``pay_period_write`` was the only writer
    of ``end_date`` in ``app/`` and rewrote every stored end from the derivation
    on every pass.  Measured 2026-08-19 on production: 62 periods, zero rows
    where the two differ.  C4-c then removed the column, so there is one end
    and this paragraph records why the swap moved no figure rather than a
    choice anything still has.

    **The domain is the WINDOW, and it must be a SUPERSET of the plan's named
    set** or ``_maintain``'s RETIRE branch could never fire: a row is retired
    precisely because the rule NO LONGER names its period, so the rows offered
    here have to include the periods the plan does not.  They do, by
    construction -- the plan is this same window intersected with the periods
    the rule names, under the same bound.  A superset rather than a strict one:
    where the rule names every period of the window the two sets are EQUAL,
    which is the ordinary case for an every-paycheck template and the case in
    which nothing is retired.  Both live callers pass a whole-schedule window,
    so the set is every one of the owner's periods.

    **Bounding by the window is also what let ``regeneration_bound`` go.** That
    helper turned "no lower bound" into the window's opening date, because a
    sweep bounded only by the SCHEDULE's opening would retire rows from the
    owner's first payday forward while regenerating inside the window alone.

"""The ONE rule for WHICH statement cleared a line -- ruling R-FL.

*Is this movement already reflected in the balance the user declared?* is the
question the whole balance arc turns on, and until plan step X-f3a it was
answered by comparing two of the app's own dates:
``settled_on <= the latest assertion's observed_on``
(:meth:`~._amounts.ReconciledThrough.covers`).  The developer's own bank exports
measured that guess -- of 55 Checking assertions only 17 equal the bank's
closing balance for their day, and of 110 movements matched to bank lines on
exact amount only 33 carry the day the bank posted them -- and
``ReconciledThrough``'s own docstring had already named the remedy: *"what
removes it is an OBSERVATION, not a second derived date"*.

**The observation is a LINK.**  ``transactions.reconciled_by_id`` and
``transaction_entries.reconciled_by_id`` name the ``account_anchor_history`` row
whose statement showed the line, under a composite foreign key that makes a link
to another account's statement unrepresentable (migration ``d5b8e2c74a19``).

**Three states, not two** (developer ruling, 2026-08-14).  A line is

* **CLEARED** -- it names a statement;
* **UNKNOWN** -- it names none, and no statement has been recorded as walked
  line by line over its date, so the app does not know.  The date rule answers
  here, exactly as it always has;
* **NOT CLEARED** -- a statement covering its date WAS walked line by line and
  did not show it, so it is genuinely outstanding.

**The third state does not exist yet, and its absence is what makes plan step
X-f3a-1 balance-neutral.**  Recording that a statement was walked is X-f3a-2's
fact.  Until it exists every unlinked line is UNKNOWN, the date rule answers it,
and this module reproduces ``covers``' answer for every row in the database --
which is why nothing was backfilled: writing the guess into the link column
would launder it into an observation nobody made.

**What a CLEARED line's record may DECIDE is bounded, and the bound is a
theorem** (:meth:`StatementCoverage._recorded_anchor_id`).  While an assertion
RESETS the ledger, the fold can only render a line under a statement closing on
the day the date rule picks -- so the record decides between statements SHARING
a day, which is exactly what the reconcile panel writes, and elsewhere it is
kept on the row while the date rule answers.  Measured: honouring one
disagreeing link made a production clone render ``$2,246.58`` on a day its owner
had asserted ``$2,746.58``.  **Plan step X-f3c is what frees it**, because an
assertion stops resetting anything there.

**The date rule is therefore not a fallback bolted on** -- it is the answer for
UNKNOWN and the answer wherever the reset denies the record its say, and it
lives HERE rather than at any call site.  Ruling R-FL's own amendment required
that much: a link cannot simply REPLACE it, because
:func:`~._walk.dated_deltas` emits every source at its own day and only the
assertion's correction cancels the ones it absorbed.  Plan step X-f4 deletes it
when the cutover makes ``balance(T)`` a sum of postings.

**Assignment, not a prefix scan.**  Both balance walks advanced a monotonic
pointer through day-sorted sources, which is correct only while "cleared by this
assertion" is monotone in the day.  It is today -- the bound above is what makes
it so -- and it stopped being something the money may REST on: the walks now ask
per LINE and GROUP by the answer, so the loaders' ordering is a reproducibility
contract rather than a precondition of the balance, and X-f3c frees the record
without touching either walk again.

**This module imports NOTHING from its own package**, and that is deliberate
rather than incidental: the rule is what every other module in the cash ledger
asks, so a dependency in this direction would make the import graph a cycle the
moment the reservation (:mod:`._amounts`) needed it -- which it does.  What the
rule needs from a statement and from a line is stated as the two protocols
below, so the contract is readable without opening ``_events``.

Services-boundary discipline: plain data in, plain data out; no Flask import, no
query, no write.  :func:`~._events.coverage_for` is the one convenience that
READS, and it lives beside the loader it wraps.

        **While an assertion is a RESET, the fold cannot render a link that

        than a policy.  A balance at date D is the prefix sum of
        :func:`~._walk.dated_deltas`, which emits each source at its OWN
        ``settled_on`` and each correction at its assertion's day.  Writing
        ``P(d)`` for that prefix and ``A_j`` for the assertions in day order,
        the corrections telescope, so

            ``P(A_j.day) = A_j.asserted``

        and the reset's whole promise -- ruling **R-S**, "an assertion always
        wins" -- is that those two sets are equal for EVERY j.  Under the date
        rule they are, by construction.  A link that moved a source across an
        assertion boundary would break the equality at every j between the two
        days, by the source's whole delta.

        **Measured on a production clone rather than argued**: honouring one
        such link made the fold render ``$2,246.58`` on 2026-03-27 for an
        account whose owner had asserted ``$2,746.58`` that day.  The mirror
        direction reads ``anchor + X``, which is the ``$4,001.42`` class the day
        partition exists to make unspellable.

        So the record is honoured where it only chooses between assertions
        SHARING a day -- which is what the reconcile panel writes, because it
        names the GOVERNING assertion while the date rule takes the first of
        that day, and production carries three such days on Checking.  That
        choice is real: it decides which correction the posted ledger books the
        line under.  It is invisible to every BALANCE, because the fold reads a
        day's boundary after every step on it.

        **Anywhere else the DATE rule answers, and it does not raise.**  A
        refusal was written first and an adversarial review's own question
        killed it: assertions are not immutable in effect, because a user may
        record a BACK-DATED one (``anchor_service.resolve_observation_day``
        bounds it only at ``earliest_recordable_day``).  Inserting one between a
        line's settle day and its statement's re-points the date rule and
        strands a link that was consistent when written -- so a raise here would
        be a 500 on every screen showing that account, reached by an ordinary
        act, with no in-app repair.  Falling back is not silence about a wrong
        answer: BOTH branches render the balance the user asserted, the record
        stays on the row for the reader that wants it, and what the reset denies
        it is only the power to move money.

        **The CUTOVER is what lifts the restriction**, not a wider rule here.
        Plan step X-f3c makes ``balance(T)`` opening equity plus the sum of
        postings; an assertion stops resetting anything, and a line may then
        clear on whatever day the bank says.

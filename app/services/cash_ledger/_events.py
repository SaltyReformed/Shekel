"""The cash fold's EVENT STREAM: what happened to an account, when it happened.

A cash account's balance is a fold over its event stream, and this module builds
that stream.  Two kinds of fact enter it, and nothing else:

* an **ASSERTION** -- the user declaring "my real balance is now $X", one
  :class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory` row, RESETTING the running
  balance at its assertion instant.  The first row is the account's OPENING (the
  origination row ``account_service.create_account`` appends); every later row is
  a TRUE-UP.
* an **ACTUAL** -- a DATED MOVEMENT of a balance-contributing plan row: the
  record that cash really moved, one ``budget.transaction_entries`` row on
  the account its money moved through (ruling **R-BAL75**).  A purchase the
  bank has been seen to take, the covering movement the status seam writes
  when a bill, a paycheck or a transfer leg settles -- each is one fact, and
  a plan row is never one (plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a``, ruling
  **R-BAL80**).  Through ``X-bi-3e`` the settled ROW was a fact too, worth
  its record less its own dated movements, and the two homes agreed by
  ruling R-FM's identity because the seam mirrored one record into both;
  the row's record is the stale cache ``X-bi-4b`` deletes.  A SETTLED
  transfer's effect arrives as each LEG's covering movement -- the RECORD
  half of Transfer Invariant 5 as restated at plan step X-bi-6a (ruling
  R-BAL13) -- read with its transfer and side
  (:func:`app.services.transfer_legs.recorded_transfer_legs`, leaf
  ``X-bi-6-4a``), so its budget column, direction and contributing gate are
  the TRANSFER's and nothing here reads the shadow row the movement still
  hangs off until ``X-bi-6-4d`` re-parents it onto ``budget.transfers``.
  A still-PROJECTED transfer's legs are derived from the parent
  (:mod:`app.services.transfer_legs`) by the plan half below.

**PLANNED (still-Projected) rows are deliberately NOT here** (ruling R-G).  A
plan cannot have already happened, so a projected row's effective date is
``max(its attribution date, as_of + 1 day)`` -- it depends on the READER's
as-of, and this leaf reads no clock.  The projected tier therefore lives in the
seam's fold, exactly as the loan plan's PLANNED tier lives in ``balance_at._plan``
rather than in ``loan_ledger`` (plan step C6a's ruling, restated for cash).
**Neither is a movement IN FLIGHT** -- a purchase recorded and not yet seen
to leave (ruling **R-BAL77**): this module LOADS it (:func:`in_flight_movements`,
the un-dated half of the one movement stream) and the plan half places it,
because where it lands is ``max(the day it happened, as_of + 1)``, a
function of the reader's as-of like every other plan item's.

**Every fact enters the stream, whatever its date, and nothing here reads the
clock.**  Deciding which facts have HAPPENED as of a date is a READER's job.  The
loan half learned this the expensive way: a walk that took an ``as_of`` made the
persisted ledger a function of the wall clock at the moment the sync happened to
run, which is a corruption generator rather than a cache (plan step A3,
``4e46a0a8``).

**ONE CIVIL DAY per fact, and it is the USER'S day** (ruling R-DH,
``docs/audits/balance_architecture/archive/anchor_settle_partition.md``).  A movement
carries :attr:`CashSourceFact.settled_on` and an assertion carries
:attr:`CashAnchorFact.observed_on`; both are resolved ONCE at construction, and
every consumer -- the partition, the fold's sampling, the period bucketing, the
posting writer's entry dating -- reads that one field.  Two independently-derived
keys for one question is finding N-34's shape (the loan split keyed its rate on
the pay period while its ordering keyed on the due date, and the two disagreed by
$500.00 on a single payment).  Here they cannot: there is one key.

**This module carried INSTANTS until 2026-07-31, and the change is ruling R-DH.**
An assertion is the CLOSING BALANCE for its civil day, so it absorbs every
movement dated that day whatever order the two were recorded in -- EVERY
assertion, with no exception for the opening (finding N-133 / F1, whose
one-day-old exception is recorded in ``anchor_settle_partition.md`` at R-DH (a)
along with the ``$2,057.42`` it cost).  The instant partition it
replaces decided that question by CLICK ORDER -- neither
``Transaction.paid_at`` (``db.func.now()`` at the click, deleted at plan step
X-f1) nor ``AccountAnchorHistory.created_at`` measures when
money moved -- and on production 2026-07-31 an ordinary bookkeeping session
(read the bank, enter the anchor, tick off what cleared) subtracted ``$4,001.42``
of already-cleared payments a second time, rendering the grid's projected end
balance at ``-$4,021.37`` against a true ``-$19.95``.  Measured over four months
of real data, the day partition cuts the correction the model must plug at its
53 true-ups from ``$40,554.34`` gross / ``-$6,998.90`` net to ``$15,367.94`` /
``-$940.06``, and it is the only rule under which the walk lands on the balance
the bank shows.

**The day is ``America/New_York``, not UTC, and that is ruling R-DH (b).**
``pay_periods.start_date`` / ``end_date`` and ``transactions.due_date`` are plain
``DATE`` columns meaning the USER's civil days, so deriving an event's day in UTC
and comparing it against them compares two different calendars.  Measured: 22 of
139 real settled rows land on a different day under UTC, 5 of them in a different
pay period (a ``$1,910.95`` mortgage payment twice), and two Eastern evenings had
ONE bookkeeping session split across two UTC days -- the shape that would defeat
the partition above.  Storage is unchanged; every instant is still stored UTC.

**Nothing here DERIVES a day any more, and that is plan step X-f1** (ruling
R-EC).  A movement stores the civil day its money moved in
``transaction_entries.settled_on``, so this module reads a fact where it used
to convert ``paid_at``'s instant into the display timezone and fall back to the
pay period's ``start_date`` when the instant was NULL.  That fallback was a
guess -- 8 live settled rows relied on it -- and it is gone with the
derivation: the settled stream's query admits no NULL day, and an un-dated
movement is a fact of a different kind (in flight) rather than one dated by
this module's opinion.

    and carried on :class:`~._walk.CashLedgerWalk` beside the assertions and the
    movements.  It is the LEVEL the fold's running total starts from: every
    balance the app renders is this figure plus what the records say happened
    since.

    **It replaces a derivation, and the model docstring lists the four defects
    that derivation caused.**  Until this step the same quantity was recomputed
    on every read as "the earliest assertion minus the movements dated at or
    before it" (ruling **R-I**), which made it move when an assertion was
    back-dated, differ between scenarios, impossible to correct, and derived a
    second time by the posted ledger.

    Attributes:
        opening_id: The ``budget.account_openings`` row's own id -- the
            restatement this fact is, so a reader can tell two apart.
        account_id: The account whose books these are.
        opened_on: The civil day the books opened.  The ``account_opening``
            journal entry is dated on it, which is what stops a back-dated
            assertion re-dating that entry.
        opening_equity: The capital the books opened with, LEDGER-NATIVE and
            in the same sign convention as
            :attr:`CashAnchorFact.anchor_balance`.
        source_id: ``ref.account_opening_sources.id`` -- whether a human stated
            this figure or the X-f3c-2a migration derived it.  Carried because
            a derived figure is the old inference frozen and may be WRONG
            (finding **N-275** measures one wrong by ``$436.05``), so a surface

            never branches on it: an opening is an opening whatever wrote it.
        recorded_at: The RECORDING instant, aware-UTC.  It is what ORDERS the

            nothing -- :attr:`opened_on` is the business date, the same

    """One assertion of an account's real balance, as a plain fact.

    Wraps one :class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory` row for the walk
    to replay.  Rows are ordered by ``(observed_on, created_at, id)`` --
    BUSINESS date first, with the recording instant and then ``id`` breaking a
    same-day tie -- the same key :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_anchor`
    takes descending, and the FIRST is the account's OPENING.

    **That order is a CONTRACT two walks depend on, not a convenience.**  Both
    replays advance a monotonic pointer through day-sorted sources
    (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.walk_cash_ledger` and
    :func:`app.services.account_posting_service.walk_account_ledger`), so a
    fact list not non-decreasing in :attr:`observed_on` makes the pointer skip
    sources it should absorb and mis-state a ``ledger_before`` the posting
    walk WRITES to the general ledger.  The read side used to re-sort and so
    self-healed it; since the one-partition step neither side does, because one
    ordering stated where the rows are read is what finding N-133 / R1 ruled.
    The key was ``(created_at, id)`` until plan step 2 made ``observed_on``
    user-supplied and the two orders could differ -- which is how a
    ``$1,307.66`` true-up once posted to the ledger tagged as the OPENING.

    **It carried the row's stored ``pay_period_id`` until plan step X-f1c3b**
    (ruling R-EO), which deleted the COLUMN.  Finding N-169 had already
    measured the field to have ZERO consumers in ``app/``; what the ruling
    added is that the column behind it was a cache of a derivation both
    posting reconciles make from ``observed_on``, was wrong on 2 of 78
    production rows, and carried an ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` that let a
    pay-period reset destroy the user's balance record.  A reader wanting
    "which period does this assertion book in" derives it from the day
    (:meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period`).

    Attributes:
        anchor_id: The ``budget.account_anchor_history`` row's own id -- the
            value a cleared line NAMES (``reconciled_by_id``, ruling **R-FL**),
            so :class:`~._clearing.StatementCoverage` can say WHICH assertion
            cleared a movement rather than only that one did.  It is the row's
            identity and nothing more: no rule reads it as an ordering, which is
            :attr:`observed_on`'s job with :attr:`asserted_at` breaking a tie.
        account_id: The ``budget.accounts`` id the assertion belongs to.
        anchor_balance: The asserted balance, LEDGER-NATIVE sign: an
            owed-as-negative liability anchor stays negative.  The walk never
            branches on account class (ruling R-J), and neither does the fold
            above it; classifying asset vs liability belongs to the net-worth
            consumers.
        observed_on: The civil day this balance was TRUE (ruling R-DH) -- the
            business date the whole partition turns on.  A source whose
            :attr:`CashSourceFact.settled_on` is at or before it is already
            INSIDE the asserted balance, because an assertion is the CLOSING
            balance for its day.  **Read from the stored
            ``account_anchor_history.observed_on``, not derived** (plan step 2,
            the opening half): the user supplies it when creating an account,
            and a true-up defaults it to today in the display timezone.  It was
            ``created_at``'s display-timezone day until the column shipped, and
            the column was backfilled from exactly that derivation, so nothing
            moved.  ``LoanAnchorEvent.anchor_date`` has been the loan side's
            version since Commit 16; this is the cash half that never had one
            (finding X5), and its absence is why the partition compared two
            data-entry timestamps and cost production ``$4,001.42``.
        asserted_at: The RECORDING instant, aware-UTC.  It dates nothing and
            partitions nothing; its one job is to order two assertions that
            share an :attr:`observed_on`, so the LAST one recorded is the day's
            closing balance.  Keeping it is not a second clock: one is a
            business date and one is a tie-break over assertions about the same
            business date.  It was the partition key until ruling R-DH, which is
            what cost production ``$4,001.42`` (see the module docstring).
        recorded_on: The civil day the assertion was ENTERED, in the user's
            timezone.  **Read from the stored
            ``account_anchor_history.recorded_on``, not derived from
            :attr:`asserted_at`** (finding **N-299**, developer ruling
            2026-08-25).  It partitions nothing and orders nothing; its one
            reader is the balance-history card, which captions a row as
            back-dated when it differs from :attr:`observed_on`.  Deriving it
            put that comparison across two clocks -- this column is the
            APPLICATION's ``display_today()`` and :attr:`asserted_at` is
            PostgreSQL's ``now()`` -- so an ordinary same-day true-up read as
            back-dated wherever the two could disagree.  Nothing else in the
            walk may read it: an assertion's effect on a balance is a function
            of :attr:`observed_on` alone.
        is_opening: True for the account's first history row; False for a
            true-up.  **A LABEL, not a partition input** (finding N-133 / F1):
            the walk treats both kinds identically -- an assertion closes its
            civil day, whichever kind it is.  It was a partition input for one
            day and cost ``$2,057.42`` of period 0's remainder while it was.

            **NOTHING reads it any more, and plan step X-f3c-2a is why.**  Its
            two consumers were the posting source kind an assertion books under
            and ruling R-I's back-projection; the first reads
            ``AccountAnchorCorrection.opens_the_books`` now (a stored fact) and
            the second is deleted.  The balance-history card's "Opening" badge
            asks ``budget.account_openings`` which day the books opened rather
            than which assertion sorts first.  The field is kept because the
            walk's ORDERING contract is still load-bearing and this is the
            cheapest statement of it; it decides no figure.

    """One dated movement's signed effect on the account, when, and whose column.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (8/7) -- one movement, its two
    parent links (a plan row's, a transfer's) and what the fold reads of it.
    A leg's fact carries both until ``X-bi-6-4d`` (its shadow's id and its
    transfer's); from then the table takes an exactly-one-parent shape
    (ruling **R-BAL88**), and one tagged field would hide it.

    The ACTUAL half of the event stream: cash that really moved.  ONE kind of
    row produces one (plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a``, ruling **R-BAL80**): a
    ``budget.transaction_entries`` row carrying a ``settled_on`` -- a purchase
    the bank was seen to take (ruling **R-FM**, plan step X-f3b), or the
    covering movement the status seam writes when a bill, a paycheck or a
    transfer leg settles (rulings **R-BAL39**, **R-BAL41**).  Its delta is the
    SHARED :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg` -- its whole
    figure in its PARENT's direction (plan step X-bi-3b, ruling **R-BAL35**),
    the same figure the posting writer books for it
    (``_posting_purchases._purchase_target``) -- so the walk and the posted
    ledger value one movement identically by construction, not by two rules
    that happen to agree.

    **The settled ROW produced one of these through ``X-bi-3e``, and its
    absence is the ruling.**  That fact was worth ``settled_cash_leg`` -- the
    row's recorded figure less its own dated movements -- and it was ZERO for
    every covered bill and paycheck by R-FM's identity, and for a
    ``purchases``-basis envelope it was the envelope's un-dated purchases
    booked on the close day.  Ruling **R-BAL77** reads those as movements in
    flight (:class:`InFlightMovement`), so no row has a leg of its own and
    the stream is movements alone.  A transfer's two legs are its two
    covering movements, each on its own account and in its own direction,
    and since leaf ``X-bi-6-4a`` (ruling **R-BAL106**) each is read as a LEG
    of its transfer -- budget column, type and contributing gate the
    TRANSFER's and its side's, never the shadow row's -- through
    :func:`app.services.transfer_legs.recorded_transfer_legs`; the posted
    ledger books each of them as its own entry against the owner's transit
    account since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``
    (``posting_service.sync_transfer_postings``, ruling **R-BAL45**), so the
    fold and the ledger read one movement each.

    **It carries TWO clocks, and the second one is not decoration** (plan step
    X-c1).  :attr:`settled_on` is the CASH clock -- the day the money moved,
    which is what a balance is folded on -- while :attr:`pay_period_id` is the
    BUDGET clock, the column the parent row was budgeted in.  They are the same
    period for most movements and different for the rest, and that difference
    IS the grid's Reconciliation row: a movement dated outside its parent's pay
    period moves the balance in one column while its income / expense subtotal
    sits in another.  Carrying both here is what lets ONE valued set be grouped
    on either clock, rather than a second load answering the second question
    (ruling R-K).  :attr:`is_income` is the leg the budget clock sorts the
    movement into, and it is the parent's TYPE rather than the sign of
    :attr:`delta` because the two can disagree: a REFUND (a negative purchase,
    ruling **bank_import:R-II**) under an expense row has a POSITIVE delta and
    is still an expense that came back, while
    :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg` derives the sign FROM
    the type in the first place -- reading it back off the sign is inverting a
    lossy function.

    Attributes:
        transaction_id: The movement's own ``transaction_id`` column: the
            plan row it records money for (ruling **R-BAL35**; never a fact
            of its own).  For a transfer leg it is the shadow the movement
            still hangs off, NULL from ``X-bi-6-4d``; the fold reads no
            parent through it.  Its readers: the sort's tie-break (6-4d must
            re-key it, a ``None`` beside an ``int`` does not sort) and the
            bank-agreement screen's names and match state
            (``bank_agreement._rows_on`` / ``_row_names``).
        transfer_id: The transfer the movement is a LEG of, ``None`` for a
            plan row's (leaf ``X-bi-6-4a``): what the far-leg exclusion
            (``balance_at._cash_periods._budget_legs``) asks.
        entry_id: The ``budget.transaction_entries`` row.  ``(transaction_id,
            entry_id)`` is the fact's identity: an envelope's posted purchases
            are distinct movements sharing one parent, and the sort breaks
            their same-day tie with it.
        pay_period_id: The BUDGET clock -- the ``budget.pay_periods`` row the
            PARENT is attributed to (NOT NULL on its column).  A movement
            takes its parent's because it spends or receives in the parent's
            column and has none of its own; that is what keeps the budget-clock
            regrouping (``balance_at._cash_periods._budget_legs``) reading a
            partially-spent envelope at its whole cost -- the dated part as
            these facts, the un-dated part as movements in flight, the rest as
            the envelope's unspent budget.  Never used to date the event; the
            cash clock is :attr:`settled_on` alone.
        is_income: Whether the PARENT is an INCOME transaction (its
            ``transaction_type_id``), so a budget-clock reduction can split the
            income and expense legs by type rather than by the sign of
            :attr:`delta`.
        settled_on: The civil day this movement's cash MOVED -- the one date
            the assertion partition compares against, the fold samples on, and
            the period index buckets by.  Read from the stored
            ``transaction_entries.settled_on``, never derived (plan step X-f1,
            ruling R-EC); the query admits no NULL, so no fact is dated by a
            fallback.
        reconciled_by_id: WHICH statement was recorded as showing this
            movement -- the ``account_anchor_history`` id its
            ``reconciled_by_id`` names, or ``None`` when none has been (ruling
            **R-FL**).  It sits beside :attr:`settled_on` rather than replacing
            it because the two are different facts: one is when the money
            moved, the other is which statement was seen to show it, and a
            statement legitimately shows a line that moved days earlier.  What
            the walk does with the pair is
            :class:`~._clearing.StatementCoverage`'s rule and not this record's.
        delta: The signed cash effect
            (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg`): ``-amount``
            for a purchase against an envelope or a bill's covering movement,
            ``+amount`` for a paycheck's or a transfer's incoming leg, and
            ``0.00`` for a card purchase (which leaves through its CC Payback
            sibling) or a movement under a non-contributing parent -- the two
            the producer is total over, stated there.

    **There is no instant on this record, and its absence is the ruling** (R-DH).
    It carried ``occurred_at`` -- ``paid_at`` normalized to UTC -- until
    2026-07-31, and every consumer that wanted a DAY re-derived one from it.  The
    instant was never a fact about the money: ``paid_at`` was stamped
    ``db.func.now()`` when the user clicked and the API refused any other
    value (it was ``dump_only``), so its sub-day precision described
    bookkeeping keystrokes and
    the partition that consumed it decided ``$4,001.42`` of real money by click
    order.  Storing only what is known keeps a consumer from reaching for
    precision the datum does not have.

    honest answer to a writer where it is a broken invariant to a reader, which
    is why the two policies are two functions over ONE query rather than one
    function with a flag.

    **The order is ``id`` DESC alone, and the term it LOST is the interesting
    half.**  The positional read plan step X-f3c-2a deleted
    (``is_opening = index == 0``) ordered by ``observed_on``, a business date
    any owner may back-date, so an ordinary act silently re-elected the
    opening.  Its replacement led on ``created_at``, justified as "set by the
    database on INSERT and therefore monotone in recording order" -- **which is
    false, and plan step X-f3c-2b-2a's review measured what it cost.**
    :class:`app.models.mixins.CreatedAtMixin` defaults the column to
    ``db.func.now()``, and PostgreSQL's ``now()`` is ``transaction_timestamp()``
    -- the instant the transaction BEGAN.  Two restatements from two tabs can
    therefore commit in the opposite order to their instants, and the second
    one's row sorts BELOW the row it was meant to supersede: the owner is told

    :func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service._governing_loan_anchor` already stated

      Whether a STATEMENT was recorded as showing it is
      :class:`~._clearing.StatementCoverage`'s separate question.
    * ``is_credit IS FALSE`` -- a card purchase never touches this account;
      it leaves later through its own CC Payback sibling (the card arc
      retires the flag at CC-7, when a card purchase is a movement on the
      card).
    * the parent is BALANCE-CONTRIBUTING -- a soft-deleted or Credit /
      Cancelled parent's movements are worth nothing, as they post nothing.

    **It loads its own rows and takes no period window, deliberately.**  An
    argument a caller can get wrong is a defect, not a contract (plan Section

"""The cash walk: ONE ordered traversal of an account's cash FACTS.

The single chronological event stream a cash account's balance derives from, and
the exact counterpart of :mod:`app.services.loan_ledger._walk`.  It yields two
lists -- one :class:`~._events.CashSourceFact` per settled row and one
:class:`~._events.CashAnchorFact` per balance assertion, each in its own walk
order -- and NOTHING else.

**The walk yields FACTS, and since plan step X-f3c-1 that is literally rather
than nearly true.**  Its output is a :class:`CashLedgerWalk`: the account's
data, re-keyed onto the civil day each event counts from and valued in
ledger-native sign.  Turning those facts into "what is the balance on date D" is
the FOLD -- collect each event's dated delta (:func:`dated_deltas`), prefix-sum,
sample -- and the prefix-sum lives in the balance seam, not here.  A consumer
holding a walk therefore cannot reach a balance from a public leaf name, which
is why the walk needs no call fence (plan step D-fold's ruling, restated for
cash).

**What an ASSERTION does to a running balance is not stated here, and that is
the step's point.**  This module replayed the assertions itself until plan step
X-f3c-1: it seeded at zero and, per assertion in business-date order, advanced
by everything that assertion cleared, recorded the correction, then RESET the
running balance to the asserted value.  That reset is a POLICY, and the policy
is not the same for every account -- ruling **R-FO** keeps it for the modelled
kinds (an IRA has no record of a price movement to discard, so the assertion is
the only fact and the reset IS mark-to-market) and plan step X-f3c deletes it
for the PLAIN ones (where the records are the fact and an assertion is a CHECK).
A walk that consulted the account's kind would break ruling **R-J**, and a walk
that hardcoded one kind's answer -- which is what it did -- silently imposed it
on the other.  So the replay moved to
:mod:`app.services.balance_at._assertions`, beside the running total it is a
policy ABOUT, and each fold applies the policy its own kind needs.

**Takes no as-of, and reads no clock.**  Its output is a function of the
account's data ALONE, which is what makes it re-derivable; deciding which facts
have HAPPENED as of a date belongs to a reader.  PLANNED (still-Projected) rows
are not in it at all: their effective date depends on the reader's as-of (ruling
R-G), so they are the seam fold's tier, exactly as the loan plan's PLANNED tier
lives in ``balance_at._plan`` and not in ``loan_ledger``.

**Two consumers, one walk** (ruling R-H).  The seam's read pass folds it into a
balance at a date; at plan step X-d the posting writer projects the same facts
into the balanced corrections it reconciles onto the general ledger, replacing
the postings-sourced
:func:`app.services.account_posting_service.walk_account_ledger`.
Today those are two independent statements of what happened to an account -- one
period-granular over transaction rows, one instant-granular over the postings it
is correcting -- and their disagreement IS the defect Phase X exists to close
(findings cash D1-D4).  One walk closes it by construction rather than by a test
holding two implementations in step.

**How that writer reaches the CORRECTIONS is a decision plan step X-f3c-1 left
it**, and it is named in :mod:`app.services.balance_at._assertions` rather than
left to be discovered: W9910 forbids ``account_posting_service`` importing that
private module in every spelling.  It is the same treatment the RESIDUE
question two paragraphs down gets, for the same reason.

**Three differences from the account POSTING walk, all deliberate, all settled at
X-d.**  (1) This walk reads SOURCE rows where that one reads back the postings;
that is the direction the whole arc turns on -- the posted ledger is a projection
of the facts, not a second opinion about them (plan Section 1, root cause 2).
(2) It does not refuse an amortizing account.  That refusal is a WRITE concern
(which correction family a loan's anchors book into), not a property of a fact
stream, and the cash-flow seam view deliberately consults no kind -- its balance
must reconcile with the transaction rows rendered beside it, whatever the
account.  What keeps a LOAN out of that view is a gate at the SOURCE, on every
resolver that feeds it: ``resolve_grid_account`` since ruling D4 / plan step A1,
and ``resolve_analytics_account`` since plan step X-a1, which closed the calendar
door finding N-38 measured open (the Van Loan rendered at ``$531.94`` against
``$15,663.59`` owed).  So this walk stays total and kind-blind, the writer keeps
the guard it needs, and no screen reaches a cash-basis loan balance through
either.  (3) It sees no RESIDUE.  The posting walk reads a third source bucket --
entries whose ``transaction_id`` / ``transfer_id`` were SET-NULLed by a hard
delete -- precisely so its running total "stays equal to the live linked total
even if the reverse-before-delete discipline is ever violated".  A source-row
walk cannot see a posting whose source row is gone, by construction, so X-d must
decide whether that defence moves to the checked-projection assert (where a
residue row becomes a LOUD mismatch instead of a silently absorbed one) or is
ceded; it is named here so that decision is made rather than discovered.

Reads the account's rows; no writes, no commit.

    read off the record rather than a second statement of either.

    **It carries the SOURCE facts alone since plan step X-f3c-1.**  It also
    emitted one step per assertion -- the jump that assertion's RESET booked
    over the records -- which made every caller's step list depend on a policy
    this package no longer states (see :func:`walk_cash_ledger`).  A fold whose
    account kind treats an assertion as a reset asks
    :func:`app.services.balance_at._assertions.assertion_corrections` for those
    steps and merges them onto these; a fold whose kind treats an assertion as a
    CHECK (plan step X-f3c) merges nothing, and this list is the whole recorded
    tier.

    **These are the amounts the posting writer books onto the account's LINKED
    ledger, in the same sign -- NOT their negatives.**  The loan twin says
    "negated" and is right to, because a loan walk tracks OWED against a
    credit-normal liability ledger; cash does not.
    :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.settled_cash_leg` is debit-positive, so
    these steps ARE the linked ledger's movements in one convention, for assets
    and liabilities alike.  Verified against the writer:
    ``posting_service._settled_target`` books ``settled_cash_leg(txn)`` -- this
    module's :attr:`~._events.CashSourceFact.delta` -- onto the linked ledger.
    The NEGATIVES are the counter legs (the category ledger, the anchor-equity
    account).  Getting this backwards is not a cosmetic error: plan step X-d
    wires the writer onto this walk, and a sign flip there still balances every
    entry -- so the trial balance closes and only the balance sheet is upside
    down.

    That equality is why the re-key lives on the LEAF: two consumers, one
    derivation.  A third statement of "which day does this event count from, and
    for how much" is precisely how the fold and the posted ledger drift apart
    (plan step E1a's finding, on the loan side).

    **Sources attributed BEFORE the account's opening assertion are emitted at
    their OWN dates, and that is deliberate but not yet ruled.**  The opening's
    correction absorbs them (they are inside the asserted balance), so the
    running total lands exactly on the assertion at its date and every date
    after -- but the prefix at a date BEFORE the opening is those sources summed
    from a zero seed, which is not a balance the account ever had.  It is
    faithful to the POSTED ledger, which holds the same partial sum there, so
    keying them onto the opening instead would break the equality above.  On
    production data 2026-07-25 two accounts carry the shape (Fidelity Savings 1
    row, the Money Market 4), and the prefix reads ``$500.00`` on both.  What a
    READER should answer before an account's first assertion is the fold's
    ruling, recorded as finding **N-37** for plan step X-b; this leaf states the
    facts and does not decide it.

    **The clearing question and this re-key are on ONE granularity, and that is
    ruling R-DH.**  They were not: the replay partitioned on the INSTANT while
    this list keyed the resulting deltas by civil DAY, so a day's total depended
    on sub-day click ordering even though the fold above reads only day
    boundaries.  This function's own prior text stated the split as a design --
    "which settles an assertion already covers turns on order within a day" --
    and that sentence is what cost production ``$4,001.42`` on 2026-07-31 (see
    :class:`app.services.cash_ledger.ReconciledThrough`).  Both halves key on
    the day now, so the collapse below is not merely safe, it is the same rule
    the clearing question applies.

    **Dated FACTS, not a balance-at-T** (the W9909 ruling): each pair says what
    ONE event contributed and when it counts, both readable off the public source
    facts.  Turning them into a balance is the prefix-sum, which is seam-private.

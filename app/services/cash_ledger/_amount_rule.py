"""
Shekel Budget App -- Cash ledger: WHICH RULE prices one row.

**The DECLARATION, and the refinement that picks between the rules it admits**
-- the half of ruling **R-FI**'s dispatch that classifies, split from the half
that answers (:mod:`._amount_source`) at plan step **X-au-f-2**, which took
that module past ``max-module-lines``.  The cut is by tier and it is the seam
the sibling's docstring already draws: *ownership is DECLARED and the
refinement is READ, and the split between the two is the design*.  Nothing here
resolves a figure, reads a price series or touches a live producer; it answers
which of the five rules owns a row's amount and nothing else.

**The alternative was shaving prose, and this project has already ruled against
it**: *"three lines of headroom is not a design, and the structural answer is a
package with one private leaf per verb"* (``transaction_service`` package
docstring), restated by :mod:`._amount_basis` when the same ceiling forced the
same choice at plan step X-au-j.

**TWO ROW TABLES, two classifiers, and neither takes all five rules.**
:func:`amount_rule` classifies a ``budget.transactions`` row and can answer
rules 1, 2, 3 and 5; :func:`transfer_amount_rule` classifies a
``budget.transfers`` row and can answer rules 1, 3 and 4.  Rule 2 needs a
salary profile, which names a TRANSACTION template; rule 5 is *= my parent*,
and a transfer has no parent transfer.  Rule 4 belongs to the TRANSFER
classifier since ruling **R-BAL10** -- it was a shadow rule until plan step
X-au-f-2 -- which is what makes rule 5 exceptionless.

Nothing here imports from :mod:`._amount_source`, so the split introduces no
cycle: this module is strictly below it.  Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``
Architecture / B6-01): ORM rows in, an :class:`AmountRule` out; no Flask
import, no writes, no query of its own.

    The dispatch key.  An explicit enum rather than a pair of link tests, because
    the rules are not a partition over the links -- see this module's docstring
    for the two subset relations that make the refinement order load-bearing.

    **It is NOT what the ``amount_source_id`` column stores, and a first draft of
    this docstring said it was.**  That column names the RELATION that prices a
    row -- its definition, or its parent transfer
    (:class:`app.enums.AmountSourceEnum`) -- and the refinement between SALARY
    and TEMPLATE, or between LOAN_PAYMENT and TRANSFER, is a property of the
    DEFINITION rather than of the row, resolved live here.  Storing the rule
    would put a definition-level fact on every generated row, where two live
    routes falsify it (ruling **R-FK**, plan step X-au-c1).

    **The OWN member is the one that IS the column** (finding **N-262**, closed
    at plan step X-au-c2): a row owns its amount exactly when it carries no
    source, which is the same NULL-ness ``ck_transactions_amount_ownership``
    pairs with carrying a figure.  Before that leaf this member was inferred from
    ``is_override`` and from having left Projected -- states the CHECK cannot see
    -- so the schema and this dispatch could disagree about the same row.  The
    status gate now sits ABOVE the resolver rather than inside it: an excluded row
    is worth ``$0.00`` whatever prices it, and asking a Projected-only producer
    about a Cancelled row is how that used to become a refusal

def amount_rule(txn) -> AmountRule:

    **One question to the COLUMN, then one to the DEFINITION.**  A row that
    carries no ``amount_source_id`` owns its figure and is priced by rule 1; a
    row that carries one names the RELATION that prices it, and the refinement
    inside that relation -- SALARY within a definition, LOAN_PAYMENT within a
    parent transfer -- is read live off the definition itself.  The refinement
    order is the rule: SALARY is tested before TEMPLATE because a salary profile
    names an ordinary transaction template, and LOAN_PAYMENT before TRANSFER
    because a loan payment is a transfer.  Testing them the other way round would
    place every paycheck as a template row and every loan payment as a plain
    shadow.

    **Nothing here reads ``is_override``, ``is_projected`` or ``is_deleted``, and
    that is finding N-262's fix** (plan step X-au-c2).  Those three are facts
    about whether a row COUNTS and about who last touched it, not about who owns
    its figure, and inferring ownership from them let four live doors write a row
    ``ck_transactions_amount_ownership`` admits and this dispatch refused -- the
    module docstring names all four.  What replaced them is the one statement of
    ownership the model has.  Two consequences worth stating because they used to
    be arms:

    * a row a human RE-PRICED owns its figure because the write door CLEARS its
      source and stores the typed amount, not because ``is_override`` is set --
      so the flag can go on carrying its other three facts (finding **N-238**,
      plan step X-au-h) without touching pricing;
    * a SETTLED row is priced by this dispatch like any other, because plan step
      X-au-c3 writes NO plan column at a settle -- what moved is recorded beside
      the plan, not into it.  No money reader asks this about a settled row:
      ``row_valuation.fixed_contribution`` answers from the record first, and the
      dispatch is reached only for a row whose money has not moved.

    **Soft deletion does not change the answer, deliberately.**  Being deleted is
    a statement about whether the row counts, and making it flip the rule would
    force ``amount_source_id`` to be REWRITTEN on every delete and restore -- a
    derived column beside a second writer, the shape this arc exists to remove.
    A deleted derived row resolves like any other and contributes nothing either
    way; the backfill's refusal to MINE a deleted row (migration
    ``a9d3c15e7f42``) is a question about evidence, not about ownership.

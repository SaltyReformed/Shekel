"""What one row MOVES through its cash account, as against what it is worth.

The confirmed-cash-effect family, extracted from :mod:`._amounts` at plan step
``bank_import:X-f6a-2`` when a second consumer arrived and pushed that module
past its 1,000-line ceiling.  **The cut is a subject rather than a size**: its
neighbour answers *what is this row worth* -- a valuation composing an amount
with an entered actual, an excluded status, a soft delete and an envelope's
purchases -- and these answer the narrower question *how much of it actually
crosses this bank account*.

**A MOVEMENT's leg is the one the balance and the ledger read, and since plan
step ``balance:X-bi-3b`` it is stated here ONCE** (:func:`movement_cash_leg`).
A purchase recorded against an envelope, and the covering movement a settle
writes for a bill, a paycheck or a transfer leg, moves its whole figure
through its account in the parent's direction -- ruling **R-BAL35**: a
movement's category, type and scenario are its plan row's, read through
``transaction_id`` and never copied, so its direction is read the same way.
Six readers spelled *a purchase is money leaving* for themselves before that
step (the walk's fact producer, the ledger writer's target, the seam's family
valuation, the statement matcher's offer, its accepted register and its undo
dialog), every one of them correct for a purchase and every one of them
``-figure`` for a covered paycheck, which is wrong by twice the figure.  The
sign follows the transaction TYPE, never the account class, so the leg is
correct whether the cash account is an asset (Checking) or a liability (a
direct charge on a Credit Card account).

**A SETTLED ROW's own leg has NO reader since plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a``**
(rulings **R-BAL77**, **R-BAL80**, **R-BAL81**).  The cash walk and the
posting writer read a settled row's money as its MOVEMENTS and nothing else,
and the statement matcher prices a settled row at what its covering movement
moves (``status_seam.covered_cash_leg``, ruling **R-BAL81**).  Through
``X-bi-3e`` all of them read the row's leg, one rule in one expression --
``gross - Sigma(card entries) - Sigma(already-dated purchases)``, signed by
type -- which was zero for every covered bill and paycheck by ruling
**R-FM**'s identity and, for a ``purchases``-basis envelope, its un-dated
purchases booked on the close day; the matcher kept that spelling
(``settled_cash_leg``) for one step longer, offering an envelope ROW priced
at its un-dated purchases beside the purchases themselves, and accepting the
row dated a day the fold no longer read.  Those purchases are movements in
flight now, the row books nothing, and the function is deleted.  What
remains of the row-leg family here is :func:`cash_leg_of` -- the matcher's
pricing of a PROJECTED row that holds no purchases, what the bank would see
if the row it names settled -- and :func:`off_statement_sum` with its three
terms, the reconcile panel's cash figure beside the booked one and the
matcher's corrected figure for a line, all ``bank_import``'s questions.

**The subtracted terms are why the row-leg family existed at all.**  A
card purchase leaves later through its own CC Payback sibling, and a purchase
carrying a recorded bank posting day is already a cash movement of its own on
its own day (ruling **R-FM**, plan step ``balance:X-f3b``) -- so an
envelope's close booked only the remainder, or the same dollars left the
account twice.  That was measured: entry 89 (`$12.79`, taken by the bank on
2026-08-12) was being taken a second time by its envelope's 08-13 close,
reading the whole of that day `$12.79` low (finding **N-274**).  The third
term arrived with the first door that files a purchase on another account
than its row's (plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-2``): a card swipe in a
checking envelope is a movement on the CARD, and checking's statement never
shows it, flag or no flag.

**Where ``gross`` comes from is the CALLER'S, and it must be.**  A projected
row is worth what settling it would book, which is
``transaction_service.settle_amount`` for an ordinary row and
``transfer_service.settle_amount`` for a shadow leg.  Asking this module to
choose between them would put the settle verbs' own partition in a third place,
and it cannot import either without a cycle.

Services-boundary discipline: pure per-row reads.  No query, no clock, no Flask
import, no write.

    The ``Sigma(credit entry amounts)`` term of the confirmed-cash-effect
    formula: an envelope's credit purchases are excluded from the checking
    outflow because each posts its own CC Payback when that payback settles
    (``credit_workflow``), so counting them here would double-count against the
    payback.  A plain transaction has no entries, so this is ``Decimal("0")``
    and the effect collapses to ``effective_amount``.

    **PUBLIC since plan step X-f2-c3, for the reconcile panel** (finding

    cash figure beside the booked one, and it takes this term rather than
    writing ``entry.is_credit`` a second time: the two would then be one rule

    The ``Sigma(posted debit purchases)`` term ruling **R-FM** adds to the
    confirmed cash effect (plan step X-f3b).  A purchase carrying a recorded
    bank posting day books its OWN cash leg on its OWN day
    (``_posting_purchases.emit_purchase_deltas``), so a row's leg priced
    beside it must leave it out or the same dollars are counted twice.

    A DEBIT purchase only: a card purchase never touches checking at all, and
    :func:`credit_entry_sum` is the term that removes it.  The two are disjoint
    by construction (``is_credit`` partitions the entries), so subtracting both
    subtracts nothing twice.  A plain transaction has no entries, so this is
    ``Decimal("0")`` and the effect collapses to ``effective_amount``.

    **PUBLIC for the same reason** :func:`credit_entry_sum` **is**: the reconcile
    panel prints what the STATEMENT will show for a tick beside what the tick
    BOOKS, and those differ by exactly these two terms.  It takes this one rather
    than writing ``entry.settled_on is not None`` a second time, so a change to
    what "already posted" means cannot leave the panel saying the old thing.

    **It reads the row's PURCHASES, not its family, and through plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-4a``'s first cut it did not** (ruling **R-BAL68**: a
    reader that means the purchases asks for them; the seam's covering
    movement is not one).  Over ``entries`` this summed a settled bill's own
    covering movement -- dated, debit, and exactly the row's figure -- as a
    purchase that had posted.  Through ``X-bi-3e`` that was load-bearing:
    ``settled_cash_leg`` subtracted it from the recorded figure, which is how
    a covered bill's own leg read zero (ruling **R-FM**'s identity) and the
    reason R-BAL68's re-point passed this module by.  With that leg deleted
    (ruling **R-BAL81**) the term had one reader left that could meet a
    settled row -- the matcher's corrected figure for a near-miss line,
    ``_landing.corrected_figure`` = ``|bank| + off_statement_sum`` -- and
    there it doubled: a `$178.32` bill covered on 01-09, matched to the
    bank's `-178.29`, booked `356.61` onto its own movement and the accept
    door's post-apply check refused the act as one that moved its own row
    (finding **BAL-523**; measured 2026-09-18 on production's own release
    through the settle door, and confirmed by the developer on the reconcile
    screen the same evening).  That reader's term is deleted with the fix;
    this sum reads the purchases for the one reader it has left.

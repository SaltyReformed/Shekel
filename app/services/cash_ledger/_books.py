"""The boundary between an account's OPENING and its RECORDS, both directions.

**An account's opening equity is the balance at the CLOSE of its ``opened_on``**
(ruling **balance:R-HG**), exactly the rule
:attr:`~._events.CashAnchorFact.observed_on` states for a balance assertion
(ruling R-DH (a)).  One boundary follows from that, and it can be crossed from
either side:

* a MOVEMENT may not be dated on or before the day its account's books open --
  :func:`reject_movement_before_books_open`, the sentence a settle-day box gets;
* a BANK LINE the books cannot hold may not be turned into one, or be named by
  a match that settles one -- :func:`reject_line_before_books_open`, the
  sentence the three import doors get (plan step **X-f3c-2b-2b**, finding
  **N-383**).  It is the movement rule reached from the EVIDENCE rather than
  from the row, and it is not implied by the movement rule: a match settles
  every member on the LATEST of its bank days, so a group holding one
  pre-opening line and one later line clears the movement check entirely.
  Measured on a production clone 2026-08-31 -- lines of 2026-03-26 and
  2026-08-17 matched to one `$80.00` envelope, accepted, and the `$15.96`
  already inside Checking's `$689.16` opening booked a second time;
* an OPENING may not be restated onto or past a day the account already records
  money moving -- :func:`reject_books_open_on_or_after_movements`, the sentence
  the restatement door gets (plan step **X-f3c-2b-2a**);
* an OPENING may not be restated onto or past a day the account has MATCHED a
  bank line on -- :func:`reject_books_open_on_or_after_matched_lines`, the
  same defect one door over.  A matched line can post well before the row
  explaining it settles, so the movement bound above calls the whole window
  between them legal;
* an OPENING may not be restated past a day the owner has ASSERTED a balance
  for -- :func:`reject_books_open_after_an_assertion`.  The one none of the
  others saw: an account with no settled movement is
  unbounded by the rule above, which is every investment, retirement and
  property account in production.  Reproduced on the developer's own Roth IRA,
  it fabricated ``$22,809.02`` of investment return and discarded the opening
  the owner had just stated.

**They are five questions about one COMPARISON, and the comparison is stated
once** -- :func:`books_hold`, which every refusal here asks and nothing here
re-spells.  Each reads a different table to answer it, so the QUERIES cannot be
collapsed; the test that decides them can, and leaving it open-coded five times
is how the ``<`` / ``<=`` distinction ruling **R-HG** turns on comes to differ
between two of them.  That is why they are read together: "two statements of
one rule that differ silently is the failure this arc names as its own root
cause" (:mod:`app.opening_infrastructure`).  The movement half lived in
:mod:`._events` beside the opening RECORD it reads while it was the only half;
with a second half it belongs beside its twin instead, and :mod:`._events` goes
back to being what its own docstring says it is -- the loaders that build the
event stream.

**The DATABASE is the structural half, and none of these is.**
:mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` installs deferrable constraint triggers over
``budget.transactions``, ``budget.transaction_entries``,
``budget.statement_match_members``, ``budget.bank_statement_lines`` AND
``budget.account_openings``, so the state is unstorable by any single
transaction from any client -- a bulk ``UPDATE``, a raw statement, a psql
session, a writer nobody enumerated.  These functions exist so an ordinary
date box gets a sentence instead of a ``psycopg2`` exception at COMMIT: the
same pairing ``ck_transactions_settle_day_needs_a_record`` has with
:func:`app.services.status_seam.reject_settle_day_without_a_record`.

**Which is why the two ROW SETS below are imported rather than re-spelled.**
Each opening-side predicate has to refuse exactly what its trigger refuses, or a
submission passes here and aborts at COMMIT with a message no surface can
render -- and the trigger's row set is deliberately WIDER than the balance
fold's: it counts SOFT-DELETED rows and the Credit / Cancelled statuses, so a
row the owner cannot see still bounds how far back their books may be restated
(see :data:`app.opening_infrastructure.SETTLED_MOVEMENTS_SQL` for why narrowing
it opens a hole on RESTORE).  Interpolating that one SQL statement is what
makes "the service refuses what the database refuses" true by construction
rather than by two authors agreeing.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in, plain
values out; no Flask symbol, no writes, no clock read.  The five REFUSALS
raise :class:`~app.exceptions.ValidationError` and do nothing else; the three
day readers and the one predicate beside them return a value and raise nothing.

    **THE comparison this module is about, stated once** (ruling **R-HG**).
    An account's opening equity is the balance at the CLOSE of ``opened_on``,
    so a day on or before it is ALREADY INSIDE the figure and recording money
    there counts it twice.  Every refusal in this module asks this and none
    re-spells it.

    **It is ``>`` and not ``>=``, and that is the whole of R-HG's ruled
    half.**  The ruling weighed the start-of-day reading -- refuse only a
    STRICTLY earlier movement -- and rejected it, because
    ``account_service.create_account`` stores the balance a human typed *as
    of* a day, which is that day's close, and admitting a same-day movement
    leaves the harm alive for exactly the rows finding **N-378** measured: on
    a MODELLED account the correction that heals the double count books to
    ``unrealized_change``, so a transfer becomes market performance that never
    unwinds.  Stating it in one function is what stops the two readings
    drifting apart across its five call sites in this package, ONE in
    ``statement_match`` (``_gaps._split_at_books_open``), and one SQL tier --
    and the SQL tier states it once too, as
    ``budget.books_hold``, which every predicate there asks rather
    than re-spelling.  *It said TWO in ``statement_match``, the second being
    ``_undisposed.awaiting_review_count`` open-coding the same ``>`` as a
    COLUMN EXPRESSION because a SQL filter cannot call a Python predicate.*
    Plan step ``bank_import:X-gm`` deleted that count in favour of a walk over
    the rows ``_split_at_books_open`` already bounds, so the exception it
    stated no longer exists and this census is re-read rather than
    decremented.  It was open-coded in five PL/pgSQL predicates
    until plan step X-f3c-2b-2b's adversarial design review counted
    them, three of which that step had just added under a docstring
    claiming the comparison was stated once.

    An account's opening equity is what it held at the CLOSE of
    :attr:`~._events.CashOpeningFact.opened_on`, so a movement dated on or
    before that day is ALREADY INSIDE the figure, and recording it counts the
    money twice.

    **What the double count costs, and why the balance healing is not a
    defence.**  The fold seeds at the opening equity and
    :func:`~._walk.dated_deltas` emits every source at its own day, so between
    the movement's day and the next assertion the running total carries it a
    second time.  The next assertion RESETS to what the owner declared, so the
    rendered balance heals -- but the correction that heals it is booked to the
    general ledger, and on a MODELLED account (ruling **R-FO**) its counter leg
    is ``unrealized_change``, not ``anchor_equity``.  A transfer therefore
    becomes market performance that never unwinds.  Measured on a fixture: a
    Roth declared ``$1,000.00`` with a ``$1,000.00`` pre-opening transfer
    reports ``$850.00`` of unrealized change against a real ``$150.00``.

    ``query.update()`` with no ORM instance to hand that function).  Two
    callers, one predicate.

    **The CALLER owns the ownership scoping, and the message is why that
    matters.**  The refusal names the account's opening equity so a date box
    can render it verbatim, and this function applies no ``user_id`` filter of
    its own.  Every caller today reaches it behind an ownership check -- the
    routes resolve the row by owner before any settle door is entered -- so
    the figure only ever reaches the owner.  A future caller that took an
    account id straight from a request would turn this message into a balance
    oracle.

    **The THIRD bound, and it closes a money defect the first two did not
    see** (code review, 2026-08-31).  The movement rule bounds an opening
    against recorded CASH; nothing bounded it against what the owner has
    SAID the account held.  An account with no settled movement -- which is
    every investment, retirement and property account in production -- could
    therefore have its books restated to any day up to today, past every
    assertion it carries.

    **What that costs, reproduced on the developer's own Roth IRA.**  Restating
    it to 2026-08-01 at ``$100.00``, over six assertions running from
    2026-03-31 to 2026-07-16, was ACCEPTED: ``unrealized_change`` moved from
    ``-$4,523.33`` to ``-$27,332.35``, so the app reported ``$22,809.02`` of
    investment return that never happened.  The stated opening was discarded in
    the same act -- the earliest assertion RESETS the fold, so the balance went
    on reading ``$27,432.35`` and the ``$100.00`` the owner typed was never
    read by anything.  Both halves are finding **N-378**'s shape, reached from
    the opening side rather than the movement side.

    **The comparison is ``>``, not ``>=``, and equality is the ORDINARY case.**
    ``account_service.create_account`` writes the origination opening and the
    origination assertion for the same day, so an opening EQUAL to the earliest
    assertion is what every account starts life with -- FOUR of the
    developer's nine sit exactly there (accounts 4, 5, 6 and 11), the other
    five having been moved below their first assertion by ``d3b6f1c8a274``'s
    legalising restatement.  Refusing equality would make the factory's own
    output unrestatable.

    **That figure said THREE until 2026-09-01, and the correction is not the
    point -- how it was wrong is** (finding **N-431**).  Three was never true
    of an unmutated database.  It counted a state THIS DOCSTRING'S OWN
    EXPERIMENT had created: "What that costs, reproduced on the developer's own
    Roth IRA" above restates account 4 to 2026-08-01 at ``$100.00``, and that
    restatement is exactly what took account 4 out of the count.  The mutating
    row was written at 10:27:58Z and this docstring committed at 10:42:53Z,
    fifteen minutes later, on the same clone.  **Dating it would not have
    caught it**, which is why the remedy is to state the BASIS: measured
    2026-09-01 on a clone of production restored fresh from a dump, at alembic
    head ``e2d7a94f61c3``, reading each account's GOVERNING opening
    (``_events.py``'s ``ORDER BY id DESC``) against ``MIN(observed_on)``.
    Re-derive it that way or not at all; a figure measured on a clone this
    module has been experimented against is measuring the experiment.

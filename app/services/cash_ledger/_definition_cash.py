"""
Shekel Budget App -- Cash ledger: what a DEFINITION's row is worth, written or not.

The tier below :mod:`._amount_source`, split out at plan step **R16-b-2**
(ruling **R-R67**, developer 2026-09-11) when that module passed
``max-module-lines`` -- and the split is by QUESTION, not by size.
``_amount_source`` answers *what is this ROW's amount* and dispatches on the
row's declaration; this module answers *what does this DEFINITION say a row
is worth on a date*, over the four VALUES such a row carries or would carry
(:class:`DefinitionRow`).  The row arms up there delegate down here, and the
balance seam's ESTIMATED loan tier (``balance_at._plan``) prices every
occurrence no row answers yet through :func:`definition_cash` -- so a row and
its estimate are ONE function, and a loan's payoff cannot move the moment
generation writes the row.

**Why one function, stated once.**  ``recurring_transfer_query
.standing_installment_cash`` was a copy of these arms, kept in step by intent
("the arms are deliberately the same cases so the two cannot come to
disagree"), and measured a cent apart on a loan's last contractual
installment: the copy read the contract's residual last row where the row
reads the rate period's level payment, so a `$3,000` loan at 5% over three
months read its payoff `2026-04-15` before the rows existed and `2026-05-15`
after (finding **REC-517**).  Two spellings that agree today are still two
spellings (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).  The copy is deleted; the cent that
remains is the amount model's own question, re-owned to ``recurrence:R16-f``.

Two arms, decided the way :func:`._amount_rule.transfer_amount_rule` decides
them for a written row:

* **rule 4** (:func:`_loan_payment_cash_from`) -- a loan payment, one arm per
  MODE: derive from the loan (:class:`._loan_pricing.LoanPricing`), or the
  definition's stated series plus the standing extra;
* **rule 3** (:func:`_stated_amount`) -- any other definition's stated
  series as of the row's own due date.

Rule 1 -- a figure the owner typed onto the row -- has no analogue for a row
that does not exist, which is exactly why a written row's own figure always
wins over the estimate once it is there.

Boundary discipline: no Flask, no session of its own, no clock; every money
value is :class:`~decimal.Decimal`.

    row answers yet are priced through one signature: the written transfer
    builds this from its own columns, the balance seam's estimate from the
    occurrence it is pricing and the paycheck the row would live in.  A value

            date, so the state this was ``date | None`` for -- an owner
            clearing it -- cannot be stored.
        period_start: The payday of the paycheck funding it
            (``pay_period.start_date``).  Rule 4's derive arm still takes it
            beside the date because :func:`app.services.loan_loaders.installment_for`
            serves an AD-HOC loan payment too, which names no definition and
            may carry no date; on this row the date is always present and

    The series arm shared by rule 3 and by :func:`resolve_transfer_amount`, so
    the two cannot come to disagree about what "the definition's price" means.
    Resolution itself is ``template_amount_service.amount_as_of``: the newest
    version at or before the date, holding FLAT before the earliest one, which
    is what makes it total for a row generated into a historical period.

    Two refusals, and both are states the app can reach:

    * **the definition does not own its amount**
      (``template_amount_service.owns_its_amount`` is False -- a salary-linked
      template, a derive-mode loan payment).  Its price is COMPUTED by something
      else, so any versions it holds are dormant rather than authoritative.
      **The test for this is not "is the series empty", and a control found the
      difference**: a template switched from manual to derive-mode KEEPS the
      versions stated while it was manual (X-au-a's stated behaviour -- they are
      the record of what was stated then), so an emptiness test would answer a
      derive-mode payment from a price nobody is stating any more.
    * **an empty series** on a definition that DOES own its amount: its creator
      wrote the scalar without going through
      ``template_amount_service.set_amount``, the one write door.  Nobody ever
      stated a price, and X-au-a's own docstring names this refusal as the
      reason it answers ``None`` instead of guessing.

    **A third refusal -- no due date -- was DELETED at plan step X-bv-2**
    (ruling **R-BAL17**), not re-targeted.  It refused a linked row carrying
    no date, because a pay period's bounds are not a substitute for one (a
    period begins up to two weeks before the installment it funds, ruling
    D5's contract time, so a price change inside that window would answer
    one figure here and another everywhere else).  That argument is now the
    schema's: ``ck_transactions_template_row_needs_due_date`` and
    ``ck_transfers_template_row_needs_due_date`` refuse the row at flush,
    every writer of a linked row dates it (``compute_due_date``'s answer,
    which always exists, or the chosen paycheck's start where the definition
    names no cadence -- the one-time transfer, the cleared-rule carry-forward
    arm -- which is that function's own answer for a rule naming no day),
    and an occurrence no row answers yet is dated by the same function -- so
    ``on_date`` is a ``date`` here by construction, and a refusal over a
    state that cannot be stored is a fence.

    **It names its SUBJECT rather than a row, since plan step R16-b-2.**  A
    row is one subject -- "Transfer 123" -- and an occurrence no row answers
    yet is another -- "template 9's occurrence 2026-04-22" -- and the balance
    seam's ESTIMATED loan tier prices the second through this same arm

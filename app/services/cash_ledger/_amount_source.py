"""
Shekel Budget App -- Cash ledger: WHERE one row's amount comes from.

The TOTAL dispatch behind ruling **R-FI** (plan step **X-au-b**): a row's amount
is either its OWN -- a human authored the figure, or the money already moved --
or it is DERIVED, and a derived amount is not stored at all.  Five rules, one
per source, each delegating to the producer that already answers it.  Given a
row, :func:`resolve_transaction_amount` answers what its amount column holds or
would hold, and REFUSES rather than falling back for a row it cannot place.

**This is the sibling of :mod:`._amounts`, not a second copy of it, and the two
answer different questions.**  This module answers *what is this row's amount* --
the quantity ``budget.transactions.estimated_amount`` and
``budget.transfers.amount`` carry, and the one plan step X-au-c1 made NULLABLE.
:mod:`._amounts` answers *what is this row worth to checking*, which composes
that amount with an entered actual, an excluded status and an envelope's
purchases.  Splitting them by question is what the package already does
(:mod:`app.services.cash_ledger` docstring's table).  **It is a separate module
rather than more of ``_amounts``, and that was a developer decision**
(2026-08-12): the two questions are different tiers, and ``_amounts`` was 690
lines against a live ``too-many-lines`` ceiling of 1000.  *Re-derived at plan
step X-bx, because a figure quoted as a REASON decays invisibly: ``_amounts``
reads 664.  The clause that followed -- "a ceiling nothing in ``app/`` exceeds"
-- is DELETED rather than tensed.  It is still true and it implied room that is
gone: three modules now sit exactly ON 1000 and two more at 999, so the ceiling
binds this tree generally and a module needing space must SPLIT, never shave.*
A module INSIDE this package rather than a new top-level service,
because the W9909 completeness fence is keyed on the package and prefix-matched,
so a sibling module is scoped the day it is written -- where a new top-level
module would escape it, which is finding N-28's shape.

**The five rules, and the DECLARATION that picks between them.**  They are NOT a
partition over ``template_id`` / ``transfer_id`` -- ruling R-FI refuted that
discriminator by tracing -- because two of them are SUBSETS of two others:

  1. **OWN** -- the row states its own figure, and SAYS SO by carrying
     ``amount_source_id IS NULL``.  An ad-hoc row, a CC payback, and a row a
     human re-priced.  **A settled row is NOT automatically one of them**: plan
     step X-au-c3 records what MOVED in its own columns and writes no plan
     column at all, so a settled row's plan keeps whatever ownership it had.
  2. **SALARY** -- a paycheck, priced by the salary profile driving its
     template (``income_service.salary_net_for`` over the pass's
     ``SalaryPricing``).  A SUBSET of rule 3: ``SalaryProfile.template_id``
     names an ordinary transaction template.
  3. **TEMPLATE** -- an ordinary recurring row, priced by its definition's
     effective-dated series as of the row's OWN due date
     (``template_amount_service.amount_as_of``, plan step X-au-a).
  4. **LOAN_PAYMENT** -- a loan payment's parent TRANSFER, priced by the loan
     (:class:`._loan_pricing.LoanPricing`, a module of this package since plan
     step X-au-g-2a).  A SUBSET of rule 3: a loan payment's definition is a
     transfer template.  **It was a rule about the SHADOW until plan step
     X-au-f-2** (ruling **R-BAL10**), where it moved onto the transfer, took
     the standing ``extra_principal`` with it, and made rule 5 exceptionless.
  5. **TRANSFER** -- any transfer shadow, priced by its parent transfer, which
     is itself priced by rule 1, rule 3 or rule 4
     (:func:`resolve_transfer_amount`).

**WHICH rule owns a row is next door** (:mod:`._amount_rule`, split out at plan
step X-au-f-2 when this module passed ``max-module-lines``).  That leaf holds
the :class:`AmountRule` enum, both classifiers and their refinement tables; this
one holds what each rule ANSWERS.  The seam is *ownership is DECLARED and the
refinement is READ* -- plan step X-au-c2's design, finding **N-262** -- and the
argument for it is written once, there.  **FIVE RULES, TWO ROW TABLES, and
neither table takes all five**: a TRANSACTION takes rules 1, 2, 3 and 5
(:func:`resolve_transaction_amount`), a TRANSFER takes rules 1, 3 and 4
(:func:`resolve_transfer_amount`).  Each has its own total dispatch below, and
the suite grades their UNION against the enum.

**What the column read buys is a resolver whose answer cannot contradict the
CHECK.**  Until plan step X-au-c2 the OWN arm was INFERRED from ``is_override``
and from having left Projected, neither of which
``ck_transactions_amount_ownership`` can see -- so four live doors could write a
row the schema admits and this dispatch refuses: a pay-period move alone sets the
flag (``routes/transactions/mutations.py:251``), carry-forward sets it in a bulk
``query.update`` no ORM validator sees (``carry_forward_service/_execute.py:157``),
and Credit and Cancelled leave Projected WITHOUT entering the settled band, so no
freeze ever fires.  Production carries 7 Cancelled and 2 Credit template-linked
rows and ``routes/grid/page.py``'s ``_load_grid_transactions`` loads every one
of them with no status predicate,
so the first bucket to derive would have taken out the whole screen.  Asking the
column instead makes the two agree by construction: the state the CHECK pairs a
figure with is exactly the state this dispatch answers from that figure.

X-au-c1 backfilled no declaration at all, so every row was OWN and this resolver
answered its stored column through ONE arm.  That is what made X-au-c2's
fifteen-module reader refactor byte-identical by construction rather than by
measurement -- before it, a Projected template-linked row priced from the SERIES
and agreed with its column only because X-au-b measured ``$0.00`` drift.  **The
per-kind cutovers are what stamp a relation as each bucket stops being priced,
and TWO have run**: X-au-g-2c-2 declared every transfer SHADOW (350 rows on
production, 2026-09-01) and **X-au-d** declared every non-override SALARY row
(59 rows, 2026-09-02).  *The sentence this replaces still said every production
row was OWN; it went stale at the first of those and is corrected here rather
than at the step that made it false a second time.*  X-au-e and X-au-f are what
remain.  A CC payback is the kind carrying NEITHER link while its
amount is derived (``credit_workflow.create_cc_payback_transaction`` copies the
source row's figure, ``entry_credit_workflow.sync_entry_payback`` re-states it as
the sum of the source's credit entries), so it places as OWN here and needs a
relation of its own to stop -- finding **N-243**, plan step X-au-i.

**A refusal is a refusal, never a fallback.**  Where a derived rule's producer
cannot answer -- no due date to resolve a series on, an EMPTY series, no live
net for the row's period, a loan whose basis will not resolve, a missing parent
-- :class:`~app.exceptions.AmountUnresolvable` is raised naming the row and the
rule.  Falling back to the stored column would publish exactly the stale figure
this arc exists to delete, and once a per-kind cutover (plan steps
X-au-d..X-au-i) declares that row's relation its column is NULL, so the fallback
would be a ``None`` in a money path.  Zero rows on
production take any refusal arm (measured 2026-08-12 over all 997), so each one
carries a seeded control instead.

**The DERIVATION tier is separate, and finding N-228 is why.**  The salary
derivation runs the paycheck engine over the owner's WHOLE pay-period set, so
asking it per row is quadratic work and was already measured as a defect.
:func:`amount_basis` holds each live derivation ONCE and hands the resolver
both; the rules read the derivation their own kind owns, so which rule applies
is never decided by which map a row appears in.  That distinction is the refuted
discriminator one level down.  It is keyed on a ``(user_id, scenario_id)`` pair
rather than on an ``Account`` -- it only ever read ``account.user_id`` -- so a
CROSS-ACCOUNT reader builds one basis for everything it loaded instead of
grouping its rows by account first (plan step X-au-c2).

**A basis is pinned to an OWNER and a SCENARIO, not to a row set** (plan step
X-au-c2b), and that is what makes "one pricing pass per read pass" structural
rather than a convention each surface remembers.  Everything expensive here is
scoped that way already -- the paycheck engine by owner, a loan's P&I and escrow
history by loan -- so storing per-row ANSWERS made a pass row-set-shaped for no
reason and cost a re-derivation every time a request loaded a second row set
(findings **N-268**, **N-269**).  A read pass carries its own through
``balance_at.BalanceContext.amounts``; a write door that prices one row builds
one and pays only for the rules that row reaches.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture / B6-01): plain data and ORM
rows in, ``Decimal`` out; no Flask import, no writes.

    """Return what *txn*'s amount is, by the rule that owns it.

    The resolver plan step X-au-b exists to build.  It is TOTAL over rows -- one
    of five rules applies to every one -- and total in its answer: it returns a
    ``Decimal`` or it raises, never ``None`` and never a plausible substitute.

    Proven equal to the answer the app gives today for **every one of the 997
    rows** on the 2026-08-12 production clone
    (``tests/manual/verify_amount_resolver.py``).  "The answer the app gives
    today" is not single-valued -- ``routes/grid/page.py``'s ``index`` reads the override map
    while ``dashboard_service.py:279`` reads the raw column, which IS finding
    **N-224** -- so the oracle grades the OVERRIDE-MAP answer, the one every
    balance surface folds.

    **It is UNWIRED as of this step.**  Nothing in ``app/`` calls it yet; plan
    step X-au-c2 routes the readers through it, and X-au-c3 makes a settled row
    RECORD what moved so no settled row is priced here at all.

    **A caller resolving many rows should apply
    :func:`~app.utils.amount_relationships.pricing_load_options`**, re-exported
    from this package so a caller asks the amount model for its own load.  It
    was a paragraph naming seven relationships that every routed loader had to
    remember; plan step X-au-g-2c-2 made it a function, because
    that step is what made the ``Transaction.transfer`` chain load-bearing --
    a transfer shadow is DERIVED now, so the grid, the cash fold and the loan
    payment feed each walk to a parent per row without it.  It lives one tier
    DOWN because ``loan_loaders`` needs it and this package imports
    ``loan_loaders``; that module states the argument.

    **It no longer asks whether *txn* was in the basis's row set** (plan step
    X-au-c2b).  A basis holds DERIVATIONS pinned to an owner and a scenario, not
    answers pinned to a row set, so every row of that owner and scenario is
    resolvable against it and the membership refusal this used to raise has no
    state left to describe.

    **What it asks INSTEAD is the pin the caller can still get wrong**, and the
    substitution is the point rather than a smaller guard.  ``priced_ids``
    caught "this row was not in the set I built over"; it could not catch "this
    basis belongs to another scenario", which is the mistake that actually
    changes a figure -- ``LoanPricing`` resolves a loan against ITS scenario's
    payment history, so a foreign basis answers a different ``monthly_payment``
    with no error at all.  A row states its own ``scenario_id`` in a column, so
    the check is free and TOTAL where the membership set was neither.

    An adversarial review of this step's own build is what put it here: the
    control that replaced the deleted membership test proved the SAFE direction
    (a basis answers for a row it was not built over) and left the unsafe one --
    a silently different number -- with nothing asserting it.

    Args:
        txn: The :class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` to price.  It must
            belong to *basis*'s scenario.
        basis: The read pass's :class:`AmountBasis` (:func:`amount_basis`).

    Returns:
        The row's amount as a ``Decimal``.

    Raises:
        AmountUnresolvable: When *txn* belongs to another scenario than *basis*,
            or when the rule that owns this row cannot answer for it.  See the
            module docstring: a refusal is never a fallback.

            **No OTHER exception this arc defines reaches a caller here**
            -- ``amount_rule`` can still raise ``KeyError`` for a ref member
            added without a rule beside it, which is documented at that
            dispatch -- **and a second clause here said otherwise until plan
            step X-au-g-2c-1 re-took it.**  That clause named
            ``UndatedSettleError``, "propagated from the DERIVE-mode loan arm,
            whose producer loads the loan's payment history" -- true when it was
            written and false since plan step **X-au-g-1** deleted that load.
            The derive arm reaches ``_loan_installment._installment_cash``,

            total: a stored ``due_date`` or one computed from the period start)
            and reads a rate period and an escrow

    :func:`~._amounts.contributions_by_id` rather than a second spelling of it.
    The two answer different questions and a reader wants one or the other:

      * a CONTRIBUTION is what the row is worth to a balance -- ``0`` for an
        excluded row, what the row RECORDED as having moved once it has settled
        (``row_valuation.settled_figure``), else the resolved amount;
      * an AMOUNT is what the row's budget IS, unconditionally.

    **Ruling E-21 is why the second exists.**  An entry-tracked bill row's
    budget base is ``estimated_amount`` -- never what the row recorded as
    having moved, never status-dependent -- so the row's three figures (the amount cell, the
    remaining, the over-budget flag) all answer one question.  A contribution
    would break both halves of that: it answers ``$0.00`` for a Cancelled
    envelope, whose budget is still its budget, and it answers the entered
    actual for a settled one, which would silently re-base a variance on the
    number it is being compared against.

    **There is deliberately NO status gate above the resolve**, which is the one
    place this differs in shape from ``contributions_by_id``.  That batch gates
    first because an excluded row is worth ``$0.00`` and has no producer to
    answer it; here the excluded row's budget is exactly what is being asked
    for, so the resolver is asked for every row.  A per-kind cutover
    (X-au-d..X-au-i) that declares a row derived owes that row a producer that
    answers whatever its status -- and rule 2 and rule 4 stopped reading status
    at this same step precisely so they can.

    Every id in *rows* appears in the result, so a caller indexes it with ``[]``

    ``budget.transfers.amount`` is the second column ruling R-FI's CHECK covers,
    so its rules belong here beside the transaction's rather than in a module of
    their own.  Three of the five can apply: a transfer owns its figure, its
    definition's series states it as of the transfer's own due date, or -- since
    plan step X-au-f-2 -- it is a LOAN PAYMENT and the loan says what it costs.
    Which of the three is :func:`transfer_amount_rule`, asking the
    ``amount_source_id`` column and then the definition, never an inference from
    ``is_override``, from having left Projected, or from carrying a template
    (plan step X-au-c2, finding **N-262**).  An AD-HOC transfer is structurally
    in the first state: ``ck_transfers_adhoc_owns_amount`` refuses a declaration
    on one, because nobody generated it and no definition states its price.

    **A LOAN PAYMENT'S CASH IS ANSWERED HERE, AND THAT IS RULING R-BAL10**
    (plan step X-au-f-2, closing finding **N-263**).  This function took no
    basis and had no loan arm: a derive-mode payment's parent reached the series
    arm and was REFUSED by ``template_amount_service.owns_its_amount``, which
    was correct while the parent still stored a figure and unpriceable the
    moment ``X-au-f-3`` empties that column.  The occurrence is ONE economic
    event held as three rows only because Transfer Invariant 5 makes the fold
    read ``budget.transactions``; the two legs are its PROJECTION, so the
    value's home is the parent and each leg reads it (rule 5).

    **The OWN arm is asked FIRST, and on a loan payment that is the whole of
    R-JM.**  A transfer carrying a figure owns it whatever its template says, so
    an owner who typed ``$1,325.00`` on a derive-mode payment gets
    ``$1,325.00`` at the parent and at both legs -- the contract does not
    overrule them and the standing extra is not added on top of what they
    typed, because the figure they typed IS the cash that leaves the bank
    (**R-IO**, **R-IW**).  Before this step the legs answered the CONTRACT
    while the parent answered the owner, which is the ``$174.10`` divergence
    R-JM was ruled to make unrepresentable.

    **It takes the read pass's basis and states NO scenario pin, which is where
    it differs from its transaction twin.**  That twin refuses a foreign basis
    because rule 2 resolves against ``basis.salary``, an owner-and-scenario
    derivation, so a foreign basis answers a different figure with nothing to
    say so.  Nothing on THIS side is scoped that way: the only derivation a
    transfer reaches is ``basis.loans``, and a loan's terms are neither
    owner-scoped nor scenario-scoped -- ``LoanPricing`` lost its scenario
    argument at plan step X-au-g-2c-2 precisely because the parameter only ever
    expressed a mistake.  A pin check here could not change an answer, and a
    guard that cannot fire is a fence rather than a control.  The day a

      the record of what was stated then), so an emptiness test would answer a
      derive-mode payment from a price nobody is stating any more.
    * **no due date.**  ``due_date`` is nullable on both row tables and the
      transfer edit form can clear it, so a row can carry no date to resolve
      on.  A pay period's bounds are NOT a substitute -- a period begins up to
      two weeks before the installment it funds (ruling D5's contract time), so
      a price change inside that window would answer one figure here and
      another everywhere else.
    * **an empty series** on a definition that DOES own its amount: its creator
      wrote the scalar without going through
      ``template_amount_service.set_amount``, the one write door.  Nobody ever
      stated a price, and X-au-a's own docstring names this refusal as the

    plan step **X-au-d** is the only producer of a ROW's amount: generation
    used to write a second copy of this derivation into ``estimated_amount``
    and it now declares the row instead.

    *That is the narrow claim and it is the true one.*  An adversarial review
    of X-au-d refuted the wider one this paragraph used to make -- that it is
    the only producer of the FIGURE -- because ``routes/salary/views`` and
    ``routes/salary/cockpit`` each built the same ``project_salary`` call over
    the same calendar to render their own breakdowns, so the derivation was
    written three times.  **That was finding N-443 and plan step salary:R14-a
    closed it**: all three now call
    :class:`app.services.income_service.ProfilePaychecks`.  The wider claim
    is still NOT true and a second adversarial review caught this sentence
    making it: ``tax_withholding_service`` and ``tax_report_service``
    derive breakdowns of their own over a single tax YEAR.  What R14-a
    made single is the CALENDAR-WIDE projection; what this function owns
    is still only the narrow claim -- what a ROW's amount is.

    **The refusal narrowed at that step and is stated as it now is.**  It
    fired where the app held two answers: the read-time producer scoped its
    profile lookup by SCENARIO while generation's own took the first active
    profile whatever its scenario, so a template driven by profiles in two
    scenarios was priced by one at write time and by another -- or by none --
    at read time.  There is no write-time resolution left to disagree with.
    What still refuses: no ACTIVE profile in the ROW's scenario names its
    template, the profile's projection does not cover the row's pay period, or
    the row is an EXPENSE on a salary-linked template
    (``salary_net_for`` takes income only).  Zero such rows on the 2026-08-12
    production clone and zero on the 2026-09-02 one.

    **It reads no STATUS, and that is plan step X-au-c2b's split.**  The map it
    used to index was built by a read-time repair, which filtered to Projected
    non-overridden rows -- so a Cancelled or hand-priced paycheck was refused
    here for a reason that has nothing to do with what a paycheck is worth.
    Pricing asks the definition; whether a row still counts is finding
    **N-262**'s separate question, answered above this rule by
    ``row_valuation.fixed_contribution``.  *That repair is deleted as of plan
    step X-au-d, so the split it protected is now simply the shape of the
    model: there is one producer and it reads no status.*

    **A HAND-PRICED paycheck never reaches this rule**, and that is what makes
    the status-blindness safe rather than merely tidy.  The edit doors state a
    typed figure through ``amount_ownership.state_own_amount``, which clears
    the declaration -- so such a row is OWN and rule 1 answers it.  ``is_override``
    decides nothing here (finding **N-262**): a row whose PERIOD alone was
    moved carries that flag and stays derived, which is why moving a paycheck
    re-prices it for the paycheck it was moved into.

    settings row (``recurring_transfer_query.loan_payment_config``) rather than
    inferred from which map the row turned up in:

    * **derive mode** -- the cash is P&I plus the escrow in effect on the
      installment's own DUE date plus any standing extra, which
      ``LoanPricing.derive_cash`` computes from the loan's own resolution.  A
      ``None`` there means the loan would not resolve, and that REFUSES;
    * **manual mode** -- the operator owns the base cash, which is a STATED
      amount, so it is the definition's series (rule 3's arm, shared) plus the
      standing extra.

    **The standing extra is part of BOTH arms and lives on neither leg.**  It
    was added at the SHADOW before this step, which after ``X-au-m`` would give
    an owner who typed ``$1,325.00`` legs worth ``$1,425.00`` (manual) or
    ``$1,610.95`` (derive) -- the ``$174.10`` shape ruling **R-JM** makes
    unrepresentable, and the reason R-BAL10 rejected keeping the base at the
    parent and the extra at the leg.  Worked, on P&I ``$1,400.00`` + escrow
    ``$110.95`` + extra ``$100.00``: parent and both legs ``$1,610.95``.

    **ONE ``round_money`` boundary per arm, over the WHOLE sum** (ruling
    **E-26**).  The derive arm sums three terms and rounds once inside
    :func:`._loan_installment._installment_cash`; the manual arm sums two and
    rounds here.  Composing either as a round of a round double-rounds, which
    is how a cutover advertised as byte-identical parts from its predecessor by
    a cent.

    **The derive arm reads no STATUS, and that is plan step X-au-c2b's split.**
    The map it used to index was built by the read-time repair, which filters to
    Projected non-overridden shadows -- so a Cancelled or hand-priced loan
    payment was refused here as though its LOAN would not resolve, which is a
    different and alarming statement.  Whether a row still counts is finding
    **N-262**'s separate question, answered above this rule rather than inside
    it.

    **The mode is read rather than inferred, and an adversarial review is why.**
    The first draft answered "the live map when it has an entry, else the
    parent's series", which made a manual payment resolve TWO different ways:
    ``LoanPricing.live_cash`` priced a manual payment from
    ``shadow.estimated_amount + extra``, so a payment with a standing extra was
    answered from the stored column while the same payment without one was
    answered from its series.  On a shadow whose cache had drifted from its
    definition the two disagreed -- ``$1,400.00`` against ``$1,450.00`` on the
    review's reproduction -- and the arm that won was the one reading the column
    ruling R-FI exists to stop reading.  Neither arm reads a stored figure now.

    **The derive arm reads no wall clock, and plan step X-au-g-2b is what
    closed the last read.**  :class:`._loan_pricing.LoanPricing` pinned
    ``date.today()`` when the basis was built and resolved every payment's P&I
    against it -- finding **N-40** -- while the escrow beside it in the same
    sum already resolved on the payment's own due date.  Ruling **R-IJ** put
    both on the installment (as ruling D5 had put the escrow), so the
    derivation takes no date and the whole package makes no clock call --
    an AST census over all thirteen modules, asserted by
    ``test_amount_source.TestTheAmountModelReadsNoClock``.
    Dormant on production (``budget.loan_payment_settings`` is empty), so this
    rule prices ``$0.00`` there and is graded only on a seeded loan.

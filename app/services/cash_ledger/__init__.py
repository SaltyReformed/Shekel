Shekel Budget App -- The cash LEDGER leaf: the facts a cash balance folds from.

The cash-side counterpart of :mod:`app.services.loan_ledger`, and deliberately
the same SHAPE.  A loan's balance is a fold over its event stream; so is a cash
account's (plan step X-b, "a cash account is an event stream").  Both folds need
the same things underneath them, and this package owns the cash copies:

==============================  ========================  ======================

**The clearing row has no loan analog because a loan has no bank statement to
clear against**: its balance is an amortization the app derives, and its
assertions are the user correcting that derivation.  A cash account's balance is
what a third party says it is, so *which statement showed this line* is a fact
the app must be told (ruling **R-FL**) rather than one it can compute.

**The two AMOUNT rows are two questions, not one split in half** (plan
step X-au-b, ruling **R-FI**).  :mod:`._amount_source` answers *where does this
row's amount come from* -- the figure the amount COLUMN holds or would hold,
by a total dispatch over the five sources a row's amount can have.
:mod:`._amounts` answers *what is this row worth to checking*, which composes
that amount with an entered actual, an excluded status and an envelope's
purchases.  The arrow runs one way: the second consumes the first.  The loan
side has no analog for :mod:`._amount_source` because a loan payment's amount
has exactly one source; a cash row's has five, and four of them are derived.

**The DEFINITION row answers for a row that does not exist yet** (plan step
R16-b-2, ruling **R-R67**).  Rules 3 and 4 are functions of four columns a
generated transfer carries -- its definition, its due date, its paycheck's
payday and its destination -- and :mod:`._definition_cash` states both arms
over those VALUES; :mod:`._amount_source` delegates a written row to them,
and the balance seam's ESTIMATED loan tier prices an occurrence no row answers
yet through the same two, so a row and its estimate cannot part.

**The LOAN PRICING pair is in this package, and plan step X-au-g-2a is what
put it there.**  Amount rule 4 -- a loan payment's shadow is worth what the
loan says that installment costs -- is a rule about a ROW'S AMOUNT, which is
this package's question; its producer lived in ``loan_payment_service`` until
that step, so :mod:`._amount_source` had to reach UP a tier to price a row and
the loan stack could never name this package back.
:mod:`app.services.row_valuation` exists because of that reach.  The cycle it
created was REAL and pylint could not see it -- a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` import
masked the runtime one -- which is measured, with the arms and their dates, in
:mod:`._loan_installment` and stated nowhere else.  The producer moved DOWN
rather than the readers routing around it, so the arrow runs one way again --
this package
names the loan TERM primitives (``loan_loaders``, ``loan_resolver``,
``escrow_calculator``, ``recurring_transfer_query``), none of which names it --
and the loan READING tier may import this package, which plan step X-au-g-2c-1
SPENT: ``loan_payment_service.get_payment_history`` prices its feed through
:func:`contributions_by_id` rather than through
``row_valuation.settled_contribution``.  ``balance_at._plan._planned_from_shadows``
-- the SECOND unrouted reader, which a census at that step found where the
finding had named one -- went through in the same commit, so no reader of an
unsettled loan-payment row is left outside the model.

**IT BROUGHT A ``budget.transfers`` QUERY WITH IT, AND PLAN STEP X-au-g-2c-2
TOOK IT BACK OUT.**  ``_loan_pricing._load_live_payment_configs`` was the ONE
statement against ``budget.transfers`` in these thirteen modules -- the
scenario's transfers INNER-joined through their template to
``loan_payment_settings``, to discover which of them were loan payments.  That
question is asked per ROW off the parent it was handed now (ruling **R-FK**'s
live refinement), because the read-time repair the map fired for is gone.
What would have been wrong is its arriving silently, which is exactly how
``loan_payment_service``'s own "queries ONLY budget.transactions" sentence
came to be false at the top of its file for months.

**THE PLAN HALF READS ``budget.transfers`` BY DESIGN SINCE PLAN STEP X-bi-6a**
(ruling **R-BAL13**, developer ruling **R-BAL38**).  A still-projected
transfer's two legs are not rows in ``budget.transactions``; they are the
parent's projection onto its two accounts, and :func:`planned_cash_rows`
derives them from the parent through
:mod:`app.services.transfer_legs` and prices each by
:func:`resolve_transfer_amount` -- the same figure amount rule 5 answered for
the shadow row a leg replaces, with the shadow taken out of the walk.
Transfer Invariant 5 is restated to say so (``CLAUDE.md``): the PLAN half of a
transfer derives from ``budget.transfers``, the RECORD half reads
``budget.transactions`` until ``X-bi-4`` moves it onto movements, and the fold
still reads no AMOUNT off a transfer for any row that has settled.  **What the
two halves can and cannot double count, measured rather than claimed.**  A
PROJECTED shadow cannot be counted beside its leg: the plan excludes it by the
same ``transfer_id`` test that identifies it.  A SETTLED shadow under a
still-Projected parent -- a STATUS drift, which Transfer Invariants 3 and 4
forbid and no door writes (0 of 350 shadow rows on the 2026-09-15 snapshot) --
IS counted by both halves, because the record half keys settled-ness on the
shadow's status and the plan half on the parent's: ``$250.00`` checking ->
savings with the checking shadow settled around the service folds checking at
``-$500.00``, and the reverse drift (parent settled, shadows Projected) folds
``$0.00`` on both sides.  Before X-bi-6a either drift counted ONCE, because
only the shadow was read.  Pinned in
``tests/test_services/test_transfer_legs.py`` with ``X-bi-4`` named as the
step that moves it; the structural end is ``X-bi-4`` + ``X-bi-6``, after which
a transfer's status lives in ONE row and the drift is not a state at all.

**The books row has no loan analog because a loan has no books to open.**  Its
origination is ``LoanParams.original_principal``, synthesized rather than
recorded (``loan_loaders.synthesize_origination_anchor``), so there is no
stored day for a movement to fall before.

Nothing here answers "what is the balance at T".  That is the
:mod:`app.services.balance_at` seam's question, and the arrow runs ONE way: the
producers import this package, and this package imports none of them.  The WALK
is facts (what happened, in the order it happened); the FOLD that samples those
facts at a date is the seam's, exactly as plan step D-fold split the loan pair.

**The walk (plan step X-a, ruling R-H).**  :mod:`._events` and :mod:`._walk`
build the account's ONE event stream -- every balance ASSERTION, every SETTLED
row, and every PURCHASE whose bank posting day the owner recorded (ruling
**R-FM**, plan step X-f3b) -- and :mod:`._clearing` answers which assertion
CLEARED each source (ruling **R-FL**), falling to the first assertion dated on
or after it where no statement is recorded as having shown it (ruling R-DH).
**What an assertion then DOES to a running total is not here** and has not been
since plan step X-f3c-1: that is a policy an account's KIND decides (ruling
**R-FO**), this package is kind-blind (ruling **R-J**), and the replay lives in
``balance_at._assertions`` beside the total it is a policy about.  The seam's
read fold TAKES these facts, and since plan step X-c2b2 every cash figure on
every screen is that fold sampled at a date.  The second consumer is still to come: at step
X-d the posting WRITER reads this walk too, replacing the postings-sourced
:func:`app.services.account_posting_service.walk_account_ledger`, which is what
makes a stale posting a detectable cache inconsistency rather than a second
opinion.  Still-Projected rows are NOT in the walk: their effective date depends
on the reader's as-of (ruling R-G), so they are the seam fold's tier.

**Why a package (plan step D1c).**  These names were spread across three flat
modules -- ``cash_events``, ``period_flows``, and five functions stranded inside
``balance_calculator``, a PRODUCER module (finding N-30).  The scattering had a
cost beyond tidiness: the fence could only cover them with a hand-written module
list (``_CASH_EVENT_SOURCE_MODULES``), which D1b's review found SELF-ATTESTING
-- deleting the constant and the registry entry together passed green while
re-opening the hole.  A package is scoped by ONE registry key that prefix-
matches, exactly as ``app.services.loan_ledger`` is, so a module created inside
it inherits the scope instead of escaping it.  That is the Section 8 lesson --
"a fail-CLOSED gate is scoped by module identity, so creating a module is how
you escape it" -- closed structurally rather than by a literal-string test.

Fence status (post-D3).  This package calls no balance producer -- since plan
step D3 the producers are private ``balance_at`` submodules, so any attempt to
reach one fails structurally at the import (W9910).  It IS scoped for the
W9909 completeness check, so a new public function in ANY submodule must be
classified as a producer or a non-producer rather than defaulting to
unguarded.  D1a's
adversarial review proved that half load-bearing: a cash balance-at-T folded
from these names touches no fenced NAME, so without the scope it -- and a route
rendering it -- both rated 10.00/10.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture / B6-01).  Plain data
in, frozen dataclasses out; no Flask symbol, no writes.  All money is
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Account Books-Opening Service

**The ONE writer of ``budget.account_openings``** (plan step **X-f3c-2b-2a**),
and the service tier of the rule :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` states at
the database tier.  Two EVENTS reach it: an account's ORIGINATION
(``account_service.create_account``) and an owner RESTATING what their books
opened with.

**Why one writer, and it is ruling R-ES applied one table over.**  The
assertion table used to have two writers -- the account factory constructing
the row itself, and :func:`app.services.anchor_service.stage_anchor_true_up` --
and the two differed in every rule that is not the row's columns: the stager
took the owner's write lock, applied ruling **R-EQ**'s did-this-change compare
and logged the resolved day; the factory did none of it.  Routing both events
through one door is what makes those rules properties of the TABLE rather than
of whichever function happened to do the INSERT.  This module is that door for
the third member of the append-only account family.

**What the owner is stating, in one sentence.**  An account's opening equity is
the capital its books opened with -- the level every balance the app has ever
rendered for it is stacked on top of.  Until this step it was written once, at
creation, and could never be corrected: findings **N-275** and **N-379** each
measure a production figure WRONG against the owner's own bank (``$436.05`` on
Checking; the whole of the Fidelity history), and the X-f3c-2a migration
derived seven of the nine that stand.  A figure a surface flags as a guess
(``migration_derived``) with no way to replace it is a defect, not a caption.

**Every restatement is an APPEND and the latest governs**, so the record of
what the books used to say survives the correction
(:class:`~app.models.account_opening.AccountOpening`).  An UPDATE is refused at
three tiers -- the ORM listener, ``budget.refuse_append_only_change`` and the
``BEFORE TRUNCATE`` arm beside it (rulings **R-HY**, **R-IC**) -- so "restate"
can only ever mean "say a new thing", never "erase the old one".

**Two rules bound the day, and the one that is NOT here is the point.**

* The books may not open on or after a day the account already records money
  moving (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.reject_books_open_on_or_after_movements`,
  ruling **R-HG**).  That is the boundary this arc exists to hold, and the
  database holds it structurally; the service asks it so a date box gets a
  sentence rather than a ``psycopg2`` abort at COMMIT.
* The books may not open on a day that has not happened
  (:func:`_reject_future_opening`).  An opening equity is what the account held
  at the CLOSE of its day, and nobody has seen the close of tomorrow.

``pay_period_service.earliest_recordable_day`` is deliberately **not** asked,
and the plan says so in as many words: that floor is a rule about ASSERTIONS
(ruling **R-ER**) -- it exists because an assertion opens the modelled-return
window and seeds contribution history -- and applying it here would make an
account's books unopenable before the owner's calendar begins.  Which is the
common case for a real account: the bank opened it years before Shekel knew
about it.  The opening's journal entry needs no period of its own either;
:meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period` CLAMPS a
pre-calendar day onto the earliest period rather than refusing it.

This service is Flask-isolated per the project architecture rule: plain data
in, a plain discriminant out, no ``request`` / ``session`` import.
:func:`stage_account_opening` flushes nothing and commits nothing (its caller
owns the transaction); :func:`apply_opening_restatement` owns its own, exactly
as :func:`app.services.anchor_service.apply_anchor_true_up` owns its own beside
:func:`~app.services.anchor_service.stage_anchor_true_up`.

    (:func:`app.services.balance_at.balance_at` dispatches on
    ``_resolution.configured_loan``).  Such an account carries a
    ``budget.account_openings`` row -- every account does, because the fold
    falls through to it for an amortizing account with no
    :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams` -- and **nothing reads it while
    the loan is configured**.  A door that wrote there would report success and
    move no figure, which is the silent no-op this arc exists to delete.

    The twin of :class:`~app.services.anchor_service.AmortizingAccountAnchorError`,
    and refused for the same reason at the same layer: a loan's balance is
    ledger-derived and is corrected on the loan's own page.

    **The limitation this accepts, and its first statement here was WRONG.**
    An amortizing account whose loan params are not filled in yet DOES have its
    opening read by the cash fold -- ``_resolution.configured_loan`` answers
    ``None``, so ``balance_at`` falls through -- and this refuses to restate
    it.  That was justified on the claim that such a figure is
    ``user_declared`` from creation, which an adversarial review measured false
    (2026-08-31): migration ``a7c41f9d2b60`` stamps ``migration_derived`` on
    EVERY account that predated the table, the two production loans included,
    and the Van Loan's derived opening is the ``-$531.94`` this repo quotes in
    three places.  So the honest limitation is larger than the one first
    written: on a params-less amortizing account the opening is read by the
    fold, is rendered nowhere, and cannot be corrected here.  It is accepted
    because the state is a half-built account whose repair is to finish the
    loan-params form -- at which point nothing reads the row at all -- and
    because widening the refusal's predicate from the account KIND to
    ``configured_loan`` would put a private ``balance_at`` submodule's question
    in a service that must not import one.

    **The ONE writer of ``budget.account_openings``.**  Its two callers are the
    ``apply`` wrapper below (an owner restating the books) and
    :func:`app.services.account_service.create_account` (the origination), so
    the owner's write lock, ruling **R-EQ**'s did-this-change compare and the
    audit line are properties of the TABLE rather than of one of the two
    events.  Adds to the current session; the caller commits.

    **It decides whether there is anything to append, and that decision is
    ruling R-EQ** -- the same rule
    :func:`~app.services.anchor_service.stage_anchor_true_up` applies to an
    assertion.  A restatement that names the day and the figure already in
    force is not an error and is not a second fact: it is what already stands.
    Appending it anyway would grow the restatement history by a row saying
    nothing, on a table whose whole purpose is that every row is a statement
    somebody made.

    **The comparison is against the GOVERNING row, and for this table that is
    the LATEST row rather than the latest one on or before some horizon.**  The
    assertion door has to ask its question as of the submitted DAY, because an
    assertion is true of its own day and a back-dated one governs only from
    then (finding: comparing against the account's newest row instead makes
    every back-dated double-click append).  An opening is not like that: an
    account has exactly ONE opening at a time, the newest recording of it, so
    there is one row to compare against whatever day is being proposed.

    **The lock precedes the read**, exactly as it does one table over: a
    compare-then-append is a read-modify-write, and an unserialised one lets
    two concurrent submissions each read the pre-state and both append.  It is
    taken HERE, with the read it protects, rather than at either door.  It is
    re-entrant and transaction-scoped, so the origination path -- which reaches
    :func:`~app.services.anchor_service.stage_anchor_true_up`'s acquisition two
    statements later -- pays for it once.

    **It does NOT bound the day, and the caller must have done so.**  See the
    module docstring: the two events bound it differently, and a second
    application of a CLOCK-dependent rule is the defect ruling **R-ER** deletes
    one door over.  What makes an unbounded day unstorable is the deferrable
    constraint trigger over this table, not this function.

    Args:
        account: An attached :class:`~app.models.account.Account` row, already
            flushed so ``account.id`` is set.  Caller owns the ownership check.

    **The provenance is ``user_declared`` and this door cannot say otherwise.**

    own figure "derived" would erase the distinction the column exists for.

    **The posting re-sync is not optional and it moves more than the amount.**
    ``budget.account_openings`` is read by BOTH the balance fold and the posted
    ledger (ruling **R-GX**): ``account_posting_service.walk_account_ledger``
    books the ``account_opening`` journal entry dated on ``opened_on`` and
    seeds every later correction's ``ledger_before`` from the equity.  Moving
    either therefore re-keys that entry -- ``(source kind, pay period, entry
    date)`` -- and changes the delta of every true-up after it.  The reconcile
    walks the UNION of the target and posted keys
    (:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.emit_correction_deltas`), so the
    old-dated entry is reversed to zero and the new one posted in the same
    transaction; nothing is orphaned and nothing needs a backfill.

    **Restating the opening ALONE does not settle the account's books, and the
    step that ships this door measured why.**  The account's later assertions
    still say what they said, so the gap the restatement opens is booked as a
    correction against them rather than absorbed: on the developer's own
    archived Fidelity account, taking a ``$4,863.56`` opening to ``$0.00``
    leaves the 2026-04-06 assertion booking a ``$5,363.56`` true-up and the

    (:func:`app.services.anchor_service.apply_anchor_true_up`), deliberately:
    an opening and a balance reading are two different facts, and one door
    doing both is how the app came to have two definitions of the opening in
    the first place.

    **It touches no MOVEMENT, by construction rather than by care.**  The
    constraint refuses a restatement onto or past a recorded movement, so a
    legal restatement is one every movement already sits after; there is

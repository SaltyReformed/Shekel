    code that has already rotated past the drift window) from a code
    that matches a previously consumed step (an active replay attack
    or a same-second double-submit).  Audit finding F-142 requires the
    second case to emit a structured ``totp_replay_rejected`` event;
    conflating the two on the wire would either spam the log with
    benign typos or hide the attack signal in the noise of valid-but-
    not-quite-right codes.

    ACCEPTED: The code matches a step strictly greater than
        ``mfa_config.last_totp_timestep``.  ``mfa_config`` has been
        mutated in place to record the new step; the caller MUST
        commit the SQLAlchemy session for replay prevention to
        persist across requests.

    REPLAY: The code matches a valid TOTP step within the drift
        window, but the matched step is less than or equal to the
        already-consumed ``last_totp_timestep``.  Treated as
        unauthorised by the route layer; emits
        ``totp_replay_rejected``.

    INVALID: The code does not match any step within the drift
        window, or the input was malformed (wrong length, non-string,
        non-digits).  Indistinguishable from a typo or a code from

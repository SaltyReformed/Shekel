"""What a bank line's match means once the app row it named has gone.

**A match ASSERTS an identity** -- *these bank lines and these app rows are one
movement* (:mod:`app.models.statement_match`).  Destroying one of those rows
makes the assertion false, so the assertion is withdrawn and the bank lines it
explained become unexplained again.  That is the whole of this module, and the
one act that takes a movement off the books asks it first
(:mod:`app.services.movement_removal`).

**An act is withdrawn only when it would be left naming NO APP ROW AT ALL**,
which is the narrowest condition that reaches the goal, and two adversarial
reviews measured what a wider one costs (2026-08-25).  Withdrawing on the loss
of ANY member destroyed a group act that was still two-thirds true: one line
against three rows, one row deleted, and the other two were silently
un-matched while keeping the settle days the act had given them.  A partial
loss is exactly what
:attr:`~app.services.statement_match.AcceptedGroup.agrees` is for -- it fails
the SUM, tints the act amber and offers the Undo -- so this writer fires on the
one case that flag cannot repair by itself: an act with nothing left to
re-review.  The two mechanisms split on one predicate rather than shadowing
each other -- :func:`_loses_every_row` -- which was also ``_still_holds``' own
first branch until plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4`` made an act naming no
app row unrepresentable and deleted that branch.

**Whether a SOFT delete withdraws is the CALLER's to say, and the two callers
now say different things.**  A TRANSACTION's soft delete -- one occurrence of a
recurring definition, kept as a tombstone -- takes the row's payments and
purchases off through the one act exactly as its hard delete does (ruling
**R-CC75**, developer 2026-09-23: *"Deleting the occurrence takes its payments
and purchases off the books through the one removal act, exactly as deleting
a one-off does"*), so an act the tombstone empties is withdrawn here and its
line is unexplained again (``transaction_service._delete._leaves_the_books``;
the tombstone counts as leaving, ruling **R-CC84**).  Until R-CC75 it withdrew
nothing, on the argument that a shipped button reverses a soft delete; what
that left was a hidden row holding money the balance does not count, under a
match that read explained.  A
TRANSFER's soft delete still withdraws nothing
(``transfer_service.delete_transfer``'s ``if not soft``): its restore paths
(``transfers.templates``' un-archive through ``restore_transfer``, and
``transfer_recurrence``'s maintain pass) put the shadows back, and the kept
payment a reverted leg holds under a soft-deleted shadow is ledger row
**BAL-532**'s, owned by plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4``.

**What it does NOT do is remove rows the withdrawn act CREATED**, and the
asymmetry is deliberate.  ``release_match`` is the owner's UNDO -- *withdraw
this act, and take back what it made* -- and it refuses where the owner has
edited a created row since.  This is a different act: the owner asked to delete
ONE row, not to withdraw a decision.  What survives is COUNTED
(:attr:`MatchWithdrawal.kept_rows`), and counted over the rows the owner still
has: a subject in the going set -- deleted by the same press, or a recurring
occurrence the press empties and hides (ruling **R-CC84**) -- is not one, and
reporting it as kept is the *"Nothing moved."* shape this arc has
shipped once already (finding **N-336**).  A first build counted every creation
of every withdrawn act, and both reviews measured it promising a `-$21.68`
residual would stay while the press destroyed it.

**A MOVEMENT that LEAVES ITS ACCOUNT leaves the acts naming it too** (plan
step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-1``, ruling **R-CC46**, developer 2026-09-21).
Every accepted act names movements since ruling **R-CC43**, and a member is
held to its movement's account by ``fk_statement_match_members_entry_account``
-- a key the database will not let the movement's ``account_id`` walk out
from under (``NO ACTION`` on update).  A match asserts that THIS account's
bank line IS this movement; money that moved on another account was shown by
no such line, so the assertion is false the moment the movement is re-pointed
(a "Paid from" correction, ``status_seam._covering._re_point``), exactly as
it is false the moment the movement is destroyed.  So the member goes as a
DELETE would have taken it, and an act left naming no app row is withdrawn on
the same narrowest condition -- :func:`withdraw_for_moved_movement`, with
:func:`pending_for_movements` for the screen that offers the move.  The
refused alternative kept the owner's correction from happening while a match
stood, naming the register's Undo as the remedy.

**A movement that LEAVES THE BOOKS leaves through ONE act, and this is that
act's match step** (plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-3``, ruling **R-CC54**,
developer 2026-09-22).  :func:`take_out_of_matches` is the match step of
:func:`app.services.movement_removal.remove_movements` -- take the going
movements out of every act naming them, withdraw an act that leaves naming no
app row -- after that act has reversed their ledger and before it deletes
them.
The doors that remove a movement call THAT act rather than this module: the
transaction delete verb, the purchase delete, both CC-payback teardowns, the
transfer delete, and the status seam's ``$0.00`` / ``purchases`` record
(finding **CC-358**: until this step the seam deleted the payment itself and
withdrew nothing, so the act kept its line alone and a re-match raised on
``uq_statement_match_members_line``).  The member of an act that KEEPS
another app row is taken out explicitly, as the move always did: the act is
the one path a movement leaves by, and the member key does not cascade.

**"Every door" is structural since plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``**
(rulings **R-CC54**, **R-CC63**..**R-CC65**, closing finding **CC-363**).
Three BULK doors destroyed movements without the act -- the template and
account permanent deletes and the pay-period retire -- because they judged
what they may destroy by a row's STATUS rather than by what it held
(measured: a permitted template delete erased a `$25.00` purchase recorded
from a bank line, and the act kept its line alone).  Now a row holding a
movement is history those doors keep, and neither the row's key to its
movements nor the member's key to its movement cascades, so no statement can
empty an act behind this module's back.  The read-time predicate that
stopped counting such an act's line as explained
(``statement_match._candidates.act_still_names_a_row``) is DELETED with it:
an act naming no app row is unrepresentable rather than filtered.  What this
module adds is the CLEANUP and the DISCLOSURE: the act the press empties goes,
and a door that discloses names the lines it frees before the press -- the row
delete (ruling **R-CC75**) and the two popovers (**R-CC56**, **R-CC59**).
The grid's one-click Mark Paid withdraws and logs by ruling (**R-CC56**); the
reconcile panel, carry-forward, the purchase delete and the Credit doors
withdraw and log with no caption until plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-5``
(**R-CC76**, **R-CC80**; findings **CC-364**, **CC-367**).

**Why it is a leaf module and not part of** :mod:`app.services.statement_match`.
That package imports ``entry_service``, ``credit_workflow`` and
``transaction_service`` -- three of the doors whose act calls this -- so a rule
living there could not be reached from any of them.  It imports the two match
MODELS and nothing else in ``app.services``, which is what lets the act and the
seam's move above it call one rule instead of a spelling each.

    The MATCH STEP of the one act that takes a movement off the books
    (:func:`app.services.movement_removal.remove_movements`, plan step
    ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-3``, ruling **R-CC54**), and the whole of the
    seam's re-point (:func:`withdraw_for_moved_movement`).  Two things,
    over ONE loaded set (:func:`_acts_naming`):

    * **an act left naming no app row is WITHDRAWN** -- deleted with its
      members and its creation records, its freed lines logged -- on the
      narrowest condition the module docstring states, read by the same
      predicate the dialogs read (:func:`_loses_every_row`);
    * **an act that KEEPS another app row loses this member**, taken out of
      its loaded ``members`` collection so the session and the table agree
      (``delete-orphan`` issues the DELETE).  The re-point spelled this as a
      bulk ``DELETE`` with ``synchronize_session=False`` until this step,
      which left the surviving act's already-loaded collection holding a
      member the table no longer had.

    FLUSHED before returning WHEN IT CHANGED SOMETHING (the withdrawal's own
    flush, or a member taken out), for the re-point's reason (the unit of
    work orders a DELETE after an UPDATE, so a member left to the same flush
    as a movement's account assignment would be checked against it and refuse
    it) and for the act's: the members are gone before the movement is.  An
    unmatched movement -- nearly every one -- flushes nothing here, so the
    status seam run inside a caller's ``no_autoflush`` block (the
    carry-forward batch) writes no earlier than it did before this step.

    Does NOT commit -- the caller owns the session boundary.

    Args:
        entries: The movements leaving their matches -- the whole set one
            press removes, so a group act naming two of them is withdrawn
            once and a creation naming one is not reported as kept.
        owner_id: The owner under whose books the acts are filed.
        because: The event's sentence (:data:`LEFT_THE_BOOKS`,
            :data:`RE_RECORDED`, :data:`MOVED_ACCOUNTS`).
        rows_leaving: The rows going in the same press, soft or hard (a
            recurring occurrence's tombstone goes to the owner, ruling
            **R-CC84**), when the caller is a row delete -- so a creation that
            names one is not reported as kept (:func:`_summarise`).  Empty
            when only movements go.

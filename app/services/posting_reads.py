"""
Shekel Budget App -- Posting Ledger Read-Side Helpers

The read-side companions of :mod:`app.services.posting_service` (the ledger's
sole writer), extracted when the writer crossed the module-size gate -- the
same sibling-split the loan posting package and ``transfer_service._loan_posting``
follow.  Three concerns live here:

* :class:`PostingError` -- the shared invariant-violation error both sides
  raise;
* :func:`_ledger_account_for` -- the chart-of-accounts pairing lookup the
  writer's target builders and the readers share;
* the reconciliation readers (:func:`account_posting_total`,
  :func:`settled_transfer_effect`, :func:`posted_purchase_effect`) -- the
  oracle-facing sums the integration oracles pit against each other.

``posting_service`` re-exports all five names, so every existing consumer
(the oracles, the loan posting package) keeps reading them off the writer
module -- the ledger's one public surface.

**Flask-isolated** and read-only: plain data in, plain values out; never
imports ``request`` / ``session``; performs no writes.

    The query-tier twin of :func:`app.services.row_valuation.settled_figure`, and
    the ONE spelling of it in SQL (plan step **X-au-c3**); two copies of a
    money rule is this arc's own root cause 1.  **It has no reader in
    ``app/`` since leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-4a``**, whose oracle
    (:func:`settled_transfer_effect`) reads a transfer's legs off the
    transfer rather than its shadows' records; only its parity test with
    ``settled_figure`` calls it.  (``settled_transaction_effect`` went at
    plan step ``balance:X-bi-4a`` with the row's own leg;
    ``posting_service._settle_effective`` at ``balance:X-bi-6-3``, when a
    transfer's legs became its movements' own entries and the writer stopped
    reading the pair's figure off the income shadow.)

    **The record is the row's entries, and the figure is their sum** (plan
    step ``balance:X-bi-4b-1``, ruling **R-BAL80**): ``COALESCE(SUM(amount),
    0)`` over ``budget.transaction_entries`` correlated to the row -- a
    transfer leg's one covering movement for the two readers above, an
    envelope's purchases, nothing for a close of nothing (ruling
    **R-BAL82**).  It was a ``CASE`` on ``settled_basis_id`` through
    ``X-bi-4a`` -- the stored ``settled_amount`` for a ``derived`` /
    ``corrected`` record, the entry sum for ``purchases``, ``NULL`` for a row
    recording nothing -- dispatching on the same column the Python twin
    read; both columns are the covering movement's stale cache, written by
    the seam and read by no money reader since this step, and deleted at
    ``X-bi-4b-2``.

    **The ``NULL`` arm is gone with the state it named.**  A settled row
    "recording nothing" -- no basis, no figure, typically no entries -- was
    the one row the Python tier REFUSED and this tier could only drop or
    zero; that history (the ``COALESCE(actual_amount, estimated_amount)``
    fallback to the PLAN, the freeze it forced, the undercount findings
    **N-242** and **N-298** a per-kind cutover would have produced through a
    silent ``SUM``) is the reason the record became mandatory at X-au-c3.
    Under R-BAL82 a settled row with no entries IS the ``$0.00`` record,
    which both tiers answer ``0`` -- an envelope closed empty cost nothing,
    which is what its records say -- and a settled row's figure is never its
    plan on either tier.

    Callers must still filter to settled rows themselves: the expression
    reads no status, so over an unsettled row it sums whatever the row holds
    (a reverted row's kept movement, an open envelope's purchases), which is
    not a figure that moved.

    Returns:
        A SQLAlchemy expression over :class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction`

        entry.

    17:06 production dump are dated and under a settled transfer, none
    un-dated under one) -- and parted from the ledger only in a status
    drift, where it graded the writer against a rule the writer does not
    state.

    **The legs come off their TRANSFER since leaf ``X-bi-6-4a``** (ruling
    **R-BAL106**): the movement, its parent and its side through
    :func:`app.services.transfer_legs.transfer_movement_rows`, so gate,
    scope and direction are the transfer's.  Through ``X-bi-6-3`` this summed
    the settled SHADOW rows' records (``settled_figure_clause``) signed by the
    shadow's type -- the same movements under Transfer Invariant 3, read
    through the row ``X-bi-6-4d`` detaches them from.  The SIGN and the
    narrowings are restated here rather than shared with the writer
    (``cash_ledger.movement_cash_leg``, ``purchase_posts``): an oracle that
    imported the rule it grades could not grade it.  What IS shared is the
    base join and the transfer link: this reads a movement's record-ness
    and side as the join's SQL (``transfer_legs._leg_is_record``,
    ``_leg_is_income``), the writer as their Python twin over one loaded

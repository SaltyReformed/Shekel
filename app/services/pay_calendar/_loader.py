"""The one door that reads an owner's pay calendar out of the database.

Plan step **C2-b1**.  Everything else in this package is pure -- a function of
values a caller supplies -- and that is load-bearing: it lets C1's harness drive
the derivation over production's real 61 paydays and over a generated sweep
without a database, and the two runs exercise the same code.  This module is the
one exception, named and isolated so the boundary is a FILE rather than a
convention, and the package's public surface hides it behind
:func:`calendar_for`.

**Nothing in ``app/`` called this until plan step C2-d**, which is the leaf
boundary C2-b1 shipped it behind -- the same technique C1 and C2-a used, so the
loader was proven on its own against a real schedule rather than inside a
commit that also moved every consumer.  **C2-d was that first consumer**: both
anchor-correction posting writers reach it through
:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.filing_calendar_for`.  **C2-b2 then
brought the recurrence engine** -- its ten ``recurrence.calendar_for`` call
sites now name this function, and the second calendar type and second loader
they used were deleted, so ``calendar_for`` is one name under ``app.services``
again.  **C2-c brought the cash view and C2-e the projection axis**; both have
shipped, and this sentence listed them as "still to come" until plan step
C2-f2a corrected it.  What remains is ``C2-f``'s own leaves --
``pay_period_service``'s three surviving readers at every surface outside the
balance seam, which stopped importing that module at C2-f2a.

**Why it does NOT call ``pay_period_service.get_all_periods``**, which is the
obvious spelling and is the one this must avoid.  Plan step C2-f points that
module's six ``get_*`` readers AT this value; were the loader to read through it,
that step would close an import cycle, and the fix at that point would be to move
this module -- after ten call sites already name it.  Reading the table here
instead makes the dependency run one way for good: ``pay_period_service`` may
depend on the calendar, never the reverse.

**And why it reads only ``start_date``.**  The payday is the sole fact in the
row (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_calendar.md`` section 1); ``end_date``
and ``period_index`` are derived here from it.  So the query is already written
against the schema plan step C4-c left behind: it dropped both columns and this
module needs no edit for it.  *It said C4 "does not touch this module" until
C4's FIRST commit, which ADDED :func:`calendar_at_schedule` here -- not because the
drop reached the query, but because the rolling top-up needed this read without
the cadence read in front of it.  The claim about the COLUMNS still holds; the
claim about the FILE did not.*

The schedule facts come from ``pay_schedule_service.resolve_schedule`` rather
than from a second query of ``budget.pay_schedule``: that function is the one
place "what are this owner's calendar facts" is answered, and a second copy
would be a second thing to keep in step.  *Until plan step C4-b-2 the reason
was stronger and worse -- that function carried an inferring FALLBACK for an
owner with no schedule row, so a copy would have been a second copy of plan
finding P8's circularity.  ``fk_pay_periods_schedule`` made that owner
unstorable and the fallback went with them, so what is left is ordinary
single-source discipline.*  It answers BOTH calendar facts in one read since
plan step **balance:X-bh-2** -- the cadence and ``history_opens_on``, the floor
the backward rhythm stops at -- so a calendar load is still the two queries it
always was rather than three.

def _require_schedule(user_id: int) -> pay_schedule_service.ScheduleFacts:
    """Return *user_id*'s schedule facts, REFUSING an owner who has none.

    Plan step **C4-d**, ruling **R-PC45**.  **The one refusal both public doors
    below make**, written once because it is one state with one consequence:
    the owner holds no ``budget.pay_schedule`` row, so nothing states how often
    they are paid, so every per-paycheck figure in the application is
    unanswerable for them.

    **Before this step the two doors disagreed about that owner**, and the
    disagreement is what the ruling closed.  :func:`cadence_for` refused them,
    as it had since plan step R7a-2a.  :func:`calendar_for` answered an EMPTY
    :class:`~._calendar.PayCalendar` whose ``cadence_days`` was ``None`` -- so
    the refusal did not vanish, it was DEFERRED to whichever method first read
    the cadence, which is why ``/savings`` showed a repair page for this owner
    while ``/grid`` and the account detail page each showed a blank render of
    their own.  Three answers to one state.  Refusing here makes it one, and
    the answer is the page ``app/error_handlers.py`` already renders for
    ``PayCalendarError``: "Pay Calendar Unavailable", carrying the repair.

    **The absent value it deleted is the subject of the whole step.**  That
    empty-with-no-cadence calendar was the only thing constructing
    ``cadence_days = None``, and that ``None`` travelled into
    :class:`~._calendar.PayCalendar`, :func:`~._derive.derive_periods` and
    three producers in :mod:`._views`, each of which had to say in prose that
    the state was legal only beside an empty payday set.  With this refusal in
    front of them, none of them can be handed it.

    **Not reachable by any live page, and that is measured rather than
    assumed** (2026-09-02).  Two places in ``app/`` construct a ``User``:
    ``auth_service.register_user``, which writes the schedule row AND real
    paydays since plan step balance:X-ad-a, and
    ``routes/settings.companion_create``, which writes neither.  Nothing in
    ``app/`` deletes a schedule row -- not truncate, not regenerate, not
    ``pay_period_admin.reset_pay_periods``, which passes through "a row and zero
    paydays" and leaves the row.  So the row-less owner is the COMPANION.  On
    production and on the dev clone: one owner with a schedule and 63 paydays,
    one companion with neither.

    **What keeps the companion away from this is the OWNER RESOLUTION and not
    the decorator, which is a correction an adversarial review of this step
    made** (2026-09-02).  A first draft of this paragraph said "every route
    that builds a calendar carries ``@require_owner``, which 404s a companion
    before this is reached".  An AST census of all 224 route functions measured
    that FALSE: three companion-reachable route groups build a calendar under
    ``@login_required`` alone -- ``routes/companion`` (``index``,
    ``period_view``), ``routes/entries``' four entry-list doors, and
    ``transactions.mark_done``.  The conclusion survives, for a different and
    better reason: each of those resolves the owner from DATA
    (``user.linked_owner_id``, ``txn.pay_period.user_id``) and so builds the
    LINKED OWNER's calendar, never the requester's -- and an owner who has a
    transaction or a linked companion has a schedule row.  **A new
    companion-reachable surface spelling ``calendar_for(current_user.id)``
    would 500 here**, where the pre-C4-d loader degraded to an empty calendar;
    the decorator would not stop it, because on these routes the decorator is
    not there.

    read of it.

    **It took a bare ``cadence_days`` and was named ``calendar_at_cadence``
    until plan step balance:X-bh-2**, which gave the calendar a second fact off

    this package spends its docstrings preventing, so the parameter became the

    caller supplying one owner's cadence beside another's history bound.

    **One caller today and it is not a convenience** (finding **P70**):
    ``pay_period_rolling._future_period_count`` counts the owner's remaining

    **The payday read lives HERE rather than at that caller**, which is this
    module's whole reason for existing: it is the one place in the package that

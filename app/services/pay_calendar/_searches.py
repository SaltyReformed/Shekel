"""The searches every pay-calendar answer is built from, written ONCE.

Plan step **C2-a** built these beside :class:`~._calendar.PayCalendar`; plan
step **C2-c** moved them into their own module when that one passed the
1,000-line ceiling.  Growing past a gate is a signal rather than a nuisance,
and the seam the ceiling was measuring is the one this package exists to draw:
a SEARCH over an ordered period tuple is a primitive, a WINDOW
(:mod:`._window`) is a view, and a CALENDAR (:mod:`._calendar`) is the owner's
whole schedule.  The dependency runs one way -- both of the others import this
and this imports neither -- so no two of them can answer one question
differently.

**Why they are free functions rather than methods.**  Each is shared by the
calendar and by a view over it, and the whole point of plan step C2 is that six
copies of "which pay period contains this date" already disagreed at exactly
the edges that matter (ledger row **P6**).  A primitive defined once, keyed on
one field, is what makes a view and the calendar it came from incapable of
disagreeing.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no database session, no
clock, and no model import.  Every search here is a pure function of the
periods a caller supplies.  :meth:`FiledRow.for_row` is the one member that
takes a caller's mapped row rather than a value, and it READS three attributes
off it -- it imports nothing, so the property that matters (this package loads
and answers with no app stack behind it) is unchanged.

    open; both were false by 2026-08-16** and the method's own docstring now
    carries the correction and the five callers.

    Linear rather than a map built at construction, and the justification has
    now narrowed twice and WIDENED again.  It was "once per rule" (61 paydays
    against 46 live rules on production); pay-calendar plan step C2-f2d-3
    widened it to once per generated ROW, when the recurrence engine's pricing
    lookup started resolving an id back to a derived period; plan step C2-f3c
    deleted that caller, since the generation seam carries the derived period on
    the placement; and **plan step C4-a-1 put a per-row caller back** --
    ``balance_at._cash_fold._cash_plan``, through
    :meth:`~._calendar.PayCalendar.require_period`, resolves every
    still-projected row's span here.

    **A map WOULD be faster and it is still not built, which is a size
    judgement rather than a refutation.**  C4-a-1's own design review called
    for an index; measured 2026-08-27 at the worst shape either database holds
    -- the dev Checking account's 603 projected rows against 62 paydays -- the
    scan costs **0.194 ms per fold** against **0.019 ms** for a dict built ONCE
    per fold and then indexed 603 times -- so the review was right about the
    direction and the factor is about ten.  (Rebuilding the dict per CALL, which
    is what a naive index inside this function would do, measures 0.692 ms and
    is worse than the scan; saying which thing was built when is the difference
    between a number and a slogan.)  What the measurement decides is the MAGNITUDE: a fold is
    memoized per account per read pass, so the whole saving on the widest
    render this application has is a fifth of a millisecond, against a second
    derived value that must then be kept in step with :attr:`periods`.  The
    number is recorded so the next caller pattern is weighed against a figure
    rather than against this paragraph -- and a per-row caller on a set an
    order of magnitude larger would decide the other way.

    **"Still not built" is a claim about THIS FUNCTION, and plan step C4-a-3
    is what made the distinction worth stating** (adversarial review,
    2026-08-31, which read the paragraph above as refusing the shape).
    ``routes.grid.page._build_entry_maps`` builds a
    ``{period_id: DerivedPeriod}`` index once per render and indexes it once
    per envelope row -- which is not the shape refused here, it is the
    **0.019 ms** one this measurement found TEN TIMES faster than the scan.
    What is refused is the naive index INSIDE this function, rebuilt per call
    at 0.692 ms, which is worse than scanning.  A caller that holds the whole
    period set already, and needs it many times, is exactly the pattern the
    last sentence above says would decide the other way; it decided that way
    at ruling **R-PC34**.
    **:func:`saved_by_id` below is that index, given a name** (plan step
    C4-a-4), so the second such caller asks for it rather than spelling a
    comprehension of its own -- and the choice between the two is made at the
    call site, by which one the caller can honestly use, rather than inside
    either.

    Args:
        periods: The owner's periods, in any order.  Identity is not a search

        stale in-memory id can outlive the row it named, which is the second

    **The argument :func:`require_period` used to take as two loose integers**,
    and collapsing them is what plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-a-5`` did to it.
    That signature was ``(period_id, transaction_id)``: two ``int``s in a fixed
    order, with nothing in the type system holding them to ONE row.  Five of
    its six call sites read both off the same object on the same line and were
    right by inspection; the sixth
    (``reconcile_service._assemble._block_headings``) indexes a three-column

    :meth:`~._derive.DerivedPeriod.attribution_day`, which is the day a
    projected row lands on the daily balance line.  A wrong period there does
    not raise, it moves money to another day.

    **The fields are KEYWORD-ONLY, and that is the guarantee rather than a
    style.**  ``FiledRow(1, 2)`` is a ``TypeError``, so the only way to build
    one from two bare integers is to name both -- and the only way to build one
    without naming anything is :meth:`for_row`, which reads the pair off ONE
    object and cannot cross it.

    **It carries the TABLE because more than one names a pay period.**
    ``budget.transactions``, ``budget.transfers`` and ``budget.journal_entries``

    ``None`` because its callers hold an id a user typed, a URL carried or a
    nullable column holds -- "no such period of yours" is a real answer there,
    and each of them renders a 404 or an empty state for it.  A stored
    ``budget.transactions`` row is not that: its ``pay_period_id`` is NOT NULL
    and its foreign key is ``ON DELETE CASCADE``, so the period it names exists
    as long as the row does, and a calendar is one owner's COMPLETE saved
    payday set.  So a ``None`` here is not "not found" -- it is one of the two

    stale, repeatedly -- so the next reader does not read them as permission.

    ``statement_match._candidates.destinations_for`` indexes
    :func:`saved_by_id` with one and cannot miss at all.  Both are right, and
    for one reason each states at its own scan: those queries are SCOPED BY THE

      ``READ COMMITTED``, which the posting reconciles' lock-then-reread
      depends on.  **How exposed a caller is depends on the ORDER of its own
      two reads -- whether it derives its calendar before or after it loads the
      row -- so each states its own** rather than inheriting a sentence from
      here.  What is NOT the rule is "a GET is one snapshot": ``/grid`` and
      ``/dashboard`` open a :func:`~app.db_transaction.write_transaction` block
      for the rolling top-up, so each runs read-only, then writable, then
      read-only again over a NEW snapshot.
    * **A row filed in ANOTHER owner's pay period.**  ``budget.transactions``

    **The three quieter answers were weighed and refused** (the review that
    parked C4-a-1, 2026-08-25): placing the row against no span hides a

    **The single "is this period SAVED" rule**, shared by
    :meth:`PayCalendar.filing_period` -- which must answer a row
    ``journal_entries.pay_period_id`` can name -- and by
    :meth:`PayCalendar.saved`, whose window keys the balance seam's per-period
    maps by ``budget.pay_periods.id``.  Two implementations of the predicate
    would be two answers to "which of these periods exists in the table", and
    an adversarial review of plan step C2-a already caught the first cut of
    ``filing_period`` skipping it: two lines of input returned a period whose
    id was ``None`` straight into a ``NOT NULL`` column.

    A period is unmaterialised two ways, and both are legitimate: a PROJECTION
    past the owner's horizon (:meth:`PayCalendar.axis`), and a candidate payday
    the writer has not saved yet -- which :func:`~._derive.derive_periods`
    accepts by design and which ``pay_period_write`` builds a calendar out of
    on every write.

    Args:
        periods: The periods to filter, in any order.  Their order is
            preserved, so a sorted input yields a sorted output.

    Returns:
        The subset carrying a ``period_id``; empty when none does.

    """Return the MATERIALISED periods of *periods*, keyed by ``period_id``.

    **:func:`period_by_id` in BULK, and the two are different answers to one
    question on purpose.**  That one SCANS, which is right for a caller holding
    a single id someone supplied; this builds an INDEX, which is right for a
    caller holding a whole ROW SET.  Its docstring carries the measurement --
    the scan against the index against a naive per-call index -- and names this
    caller pattern as the one that decides this way; ruling **R-PC34** took it
    at plan step C4-a-3, and plan step C4-a-4 gave the shape this name.

    **The KEYS are meant to be a query SCOPE, and that is the whole point
    rather than a convenience.**  A caller filters
    ``pay_period_id IN (<this mapping>)`` and then indexes the SAME mapping per
    row the query returned, so a row it cannot place is unconstructible rather
    than guarded against -- which is :func:`require_period`'s own rule above:
    *where the precondition is carried by the QUERY, the total form is honest;
    where it rests on two reads agreeing, it is not.*  **That pointer named the
    METHOD until this step moved the rule off it**, which is the shape a
    cross-reference fails in: the citation stayed green while its target
    emptied.  Two derivations -- an id set for
    the filter and a lookup for the span -- can disagree under a concurrent
    payday write between them; one value cannot.

    **What a caller owes for that guarantee is that the filter and the lookup
    read this ONE mapping**, and nothing here can check it.  A caller that
    filtered on a second derivation and indexed this one would get a
    ``KeyError`` rather than a wrong figure, which is the failure direction to
    be in but is still the caller's to avoid.

    **This function is PURE and its caller is the one that memoizes.**
    :meth:`~._calendar.PayCalendar.saved_by_id` caches what this returns,
    behind a read-only proxy, because a review pass asks it more than once and
    a mutable mapping shared between two producers lets one narrow the other's
    scope.  The rule and the reason are stated there; what belongs here is the
    derivation, which is what every other function in this module is.

    A PROJECTED period carries no id and is not here, through
    :func:`materialised_periods` -- this package's single "is this period
    SAVED" rule, rather than a fourth site spelling ``period_id is not None``
    for itself, which is what
    ``statement_match._candidates`` and both of ``reconcile_service._rows``'s
    scope properties did until plan step C4-a-4.

    Args:
        periods: The owner's periods, in any order.  Identity is not a search
            over a sorted key, so unlike the bisects above this carries no
            ordering precondition.

    Returns:
        ``{period_id: DerivedPeriod}`` over every materialised period, in the
        order they were given.  Empty when none is materialised, which for a
        scope means it admits nothing -- the correct answer for an owner with
        no paydays.

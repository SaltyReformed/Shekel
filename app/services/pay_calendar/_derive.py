"""The derivation: an owner's paydays in, their pay periods out (plan step C1).

``budget.pay_periods`` stores three values per row and only ``start_date`` is a
fact -- the day money arrived.  ``end_date`` is ``lead(start_date) - 1`` and
``period_index`` is ``row_number() - 1``, both stored beside the fact they
derive from with nothing reconciling them, which is why five separate runtime
fences exist to police one functional dependency
(``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_calendar.md`` section 1).  This module is
that dependency, written once::

    period_index = row_number() over (order by start_date) - 1
    end_date     = next_payday - 1

where ``next_payday`` is the following row's ``start_date``, or -- for the
last period, which has none -- the era grid's next planned payday
(:func:`~._eras.payday_after`).  **Plan step C14-c made those ONE rule.**  The last
end read ``start_date + cadence_days - 1``, which agrees with the first only
while every payday sits exactly one cadence from its neighbour; since
``C14-e-3`` displaces one onto a business day the two part, and the day between falls in
NO period or in two (**R-PC54**).

**Its one caller is** :meth:`~._calendar.PayCalendar.__post_init__`, since plan
step C2-a; at C1 it had none at all, deliberately, because the value had to be
proven equal to what was stored -- over a clone of production and over irregular
schedules the live data cannot supply -- before anything read it, wrote it, or
dropped the columns.  **Plan step C4-c dropped them, so that comparison has no
second side and the harness that took it is gone**; the proof it was is in
migration ``b7a41e2c9d63``'s docstring, measured on production itself.  What
holds this function to its values now is
``tests/oracles/pay_calendar_derivation.py``'s hand-computed sweep, driven by
``tests/test_services/test_pay_calendar_derivation.py``.

**Pure, and that is load-bearing.**  No session, no Flask, no clock: the
derivation is a function of two values, so the sweep drives it over a
catalogue of schedule shapes without a database at all.  That is what let the
same code be driven over a production clone while a stored column still
existed to diff it against.
**Every application import this module takes is a PURE LEAF** -- a module
reaching no session, no request and no ORM -- and that is the rule rather than
the names it happens to admit today (``app.services.pay_rhythm`` and
``app.utils.dates``, beside the package's own :mod:`._eras`).  So the module
still loads with no app stack behind it.
*It was written as a LIST -- "the only application imports are
``app.exceptions`` and ``app.utils.dates``" -- and a list decays: an
adversarial review corrected it on 2026-08-14 when it counted one import and
there were two, ``C14-e-1`` made it stale again by adding
``app.services.pay_rhythm``, ``C14-e-3`` added ``app.utils.business_days``
for the displacement, and plan step ``C17-b-2`` moved the displacement, the
refusal and the cadence bound down to :mod:`._eras` (ruling **R-PC73**), which
took ``app.exceptions`` and ``app.utils.business_days`` with them.  Stated as
a property, the next addition is GRADED rather than counted.*

**That import WEAKENED the no-clock property, and the honest form says which
property survives.**  Before plan step C2-f this module could not reach a clock
through its import graph at all; ``app.utils.dates`` carries
:func:`~app.utils.dates.display_today`, so the guarantee is now "nothing here
CALLS a clock" rather than "no clock is reachable".  It was taken so the period
LABEL is one rule rather than one per type that answers "which paycheck" (see
:attr:`DerivedPeriod.label`), and ``app.utils.dates`` is the only leaf this
package may take on those terms.  *There is one such type now* -- plan step
``pay_calendar:C4-a-5`` deleted the ORM row's accessor -- *and the import
stays for the reason* :func:`~app.utils.dates.pay_period_label`'s *own
docstring gives: the narrow register and the wide one are one decision (ledger
row P47) and live together, and the wide one has a caller outside this
package.*

**Why the last end is a different KIND of value, and says so.**  Every other
end is dictated by a fact -- the next RECORDED payday.  The last one has no
successor row, so the payday it stops before is PROJECTED: the owner's era
grid's next payday after the one the last record stands for
(:func:`~._eras.payday_after`; ruling 2026-08-08: "a projection stated as one").  The
RULE over the two is identical since plan step ``C14-c``; what differs is
whether the payday it reads is a record or a projection.
:attr:`DerivedPeriod.end_is_projected`
is that statement, and it cannot be recomputed by a consumer holding one period
out of its calendar.  It is not cosmetic: a projected end moves when the era it
is read from moves -- a batch that mints one, or retires one -- where an end
dictated by a recorded payday does not, and the flag is the only thing on the
value that says which kind a consumer holds.  *Until plan step ``C4-c`` a
stored ``end_date`` hid that, and plan finding P12 -- a
``/pay-periods/generate`` post naming an existing payday created zero rows and
still rewrote the stored cadence -- was the door that moved it.*

            needs a row a foreign key can point at, while "which span does this
            day fall in" is answerable by a projection.  A value that could not
            say which it was would answer the write question wrongly and

        start_date: The payday that opens the period.  The only fact in the

        that essay concludes.  *An adversarial review of this step found the

        **A different ``covers`` exists and is NOT this one**:
        ``cash_ledger._amounts.ReconciledThrough.covers`` asks whether a
        statement's coverage reaches an event day -- one-sided, and TOTAL over
        ``None`` by design.  This one is two-sided and raises on ``None``,
        because a period always has both bounds.

        **It is the predicate the SEARCHES already run**, said once rather
        than a second implementation beside them.
        :func:`~._searches.containing_index` bisects to the last period
        opening on or before *day* and then asks this; that lower bound is
        already established there, so the first comparison below is redundant
        AT THAT ONE CALL SITE and is paid anyway, because a containment rule
        with a branch missing from one caller is the shape ledger row **P6**
        counted six of.

        **What it does NOT ask is whether the end is a FACT or a
        PROJECTION.**  The last period of a calendar carries
        :attr:`end_is_projected`, and its span moves when the owner's stored
        cadence moves; a caller that must distinguish "covered by a paycheck
        that has been banked" from "covered by one the cadence implies" reads

        PLANNED tier (``balance_at._cash_fold._cash_plan``) and the reconcile
        panel's offer bound (``reconcile_service._rows.attributed_on``), so no
        two of them can come to disagree about which day an item is BUDGETED
        to.  An item lands on *preferred* -- its ``due_date`` -- falling back
        to this period's :attr:`start_date` when it has none; the result is
        then clamped into ``[start_date, end_date]``.

        **It is a METHOD ON THE PERIOD, and that is plan step C4-a-2's whole
        subject.**  It was ``utils.dates.attribution_date(preferred,
        period_start, period_end)``, three positional arguments a caller had to
        pair correctly, and pairing them wrongly is not a crash -- it is a row
        rendered on the wrong day.  Two of its three callers already held a
        :class:`DerivedPeriod` and split it back into two dates to make the
        call; the third read ``txn.pay_period`` and clamped a projected row
        against the STORED ``end_date`` while everything around it sampled the
        DERIVED one.  Asking the period itself makes the pairing structural:
        there is no second span to supply.

        **Clamping is load-bearing for the daily balance**: every one of a
        period's contributing items must fall on or before :attr:`end_date`, so
        the running balance summed through that day equals the period-end
        balance the grid shows (the calendar/grid reconciliation invariant).  A
        ``due_date`` outside the item's own period is possible -- the
        recurrence engine can date an item just outside its period's range,
        which is why the calendar query carries a due-date-in-range OR
        no-due-date path -- so such a stray date is pulled to the nearest
        boundary rather than escaping onto a neighbouring period's day and
        breaking that period's sum.

        **What this does NOT guarantee, and both halves of the paragraph it
        replaces were false** (ledger row **N-97**).  The deleted function's
        docstring named the seam's caller as
        ``balance_resolver.daily_cash_balance_series``, a producer plan step
        X-c2b3 had DELETED a month earlier, so the citation resolved to
        nothing.  And it guaranteed that a flow's calendar cell and the balance
        line's step for it land on the SAME day: that stopped holding at plan
        step X-c2b2, when the balance line became the cash fold, which steps a
        SETTLED row on the day its money moved and a projected one on
        ``max(attribution, as_of + 1)`` (rulings **R-DH (b)** and **R-G**).
        Neither is this day, so a chip and its own step can sit days apart:
        ``|settled_on - due_date|`` over the real Checking account's settled
        rows is **median 2, p75 7, max 25 across 126 rows, re-measured
        2026-08-28**.  It moved here CARRYING NO DATE, quoted as "median 2, p75
        6, max 25" over 130 rows, and a measurement quoted as a REASON decays
        invisibly because nobody re-checks a premise -- so the leaf that
        relocated it re-took it rather than copying it forward.  That
        divergence is finding **N-58**, it is an open fork rather than a
        settled rule, and ``calendar_service._get_display_day`` states it at

    falls to the cadence projection -- which means a partial list makes one
    period report a different end depending on which window asked (plan finding

    ``$100,000.00`` loan true-up against the owner's whole calendar, versus
    against a window that excluded the true-up's own period, moved the balance
    by that much on the days between -- because with the containing period
    absent the old locator missed and its fallback fired.  That measurement
    lived on ``loan_ledger/_visible.owner_pay_periods``' docstring until plan
    step C2-d deleted the function, and it is restated here rather than lost,

    partiality -- a slice of paydays is indistinguishable from a short schedule
    -- so the guarantee has to be structural at the caller.  Plan step C2 makes
    it so: the calendar is built once from the complete set and a window becomes
    a VIEW over it that keeps the real ends.

    **A derived end is not stable against a later write, and that is the one
    way it differs from the column it replaces** (found by adversarial review
    of this step, 2026-08-08).  A stored ``end_date`` cannot move when a
    neighbouring row is written; a derived one can.  Concretely, with paydays
    ``[01-02, 01-16]`` at cadence 14 the second period ends 01-29 (projected);
    append the payday 01-28 -- LATER than every existing one, so a forward-only
    write by the plan's own definition -- and that end moves back to 01-27.
    Only ends inside the last period's PROJECTED span can move this way; an end
    dictated by a following payday is fixed for as long as that payday is.
    A row already dated into the vacated days is not left outside its period --
    :meth:`DerivedPeriod.attribution_day` clamps it -- so the damage is a row
    silently RENDERED on a different day, which is plan finding P10's shape
    reached through a door P10 does not cover.  ``_reject_overlapping_batch``
    blocked that write by comparing against the stored end; plan step **C3-b**
    replaced it with ``pay_period_batch.reject_backward_payday``, and **that
    floor is what closes this example** -- corrected 2026-08-11, because this
    paragraph named C3-b's coverage rule until the floor's own correction made
    the citation wrong and the rule was then deleted.  The floor is the era
    grid's next payday after the one the latest record stands for
    (:func:`~._eras.payday_after`, the same call that closes the last period here), so
    on ``[01-02, 01-16]`` under an era from 01-02 at cadence 14 the earliest
    acceptable new payday is 01-30 and the 01-28 above is refused outright.

    **What the floor buys is exactly that and no more, and a second adversarial
    review caught a first draft of this paragraph claiming more**: no write can
    place a payday INSIDE an existing paycheck's derived span.  A stored end can
    still be pulled BACK, two ways, and both are exercised by C3-b's own tests
    -- ``retire_paydays`` drops the newly-last survivor from its
    successor-dictated end to the cadence projection, and ``record_paydays``
    shortens the previously-last period whenever the stored cadence is shorter
    than the one the schedule was generated at (row **P28**'s legacy shape).
    The derivation states the property and does not police it: it is a function
    of a payday set, and which sets a user may write is the writer's question.

    Order and duplication are handled HERE rather than trusted, because the
    result's whole value is that index order and date order cannot disagree:
    the input is sorted (so a caller's query order cannot change the answer) and
    a repeated payday is refused (it would place two periods on one opening day
    and give the earlier of them an ``end_date`` before its own
    ``start_date``).

    Args:
        paydays: The owner's complete set of paydays as
            ``(period_id, payday)`` pairs, in any order.  ``period_id`` is the
            ``budget.pay_periods.id`` the payday was read from, or ``None`` for
            a period that is not materialised; it takes no part in the
            derivation and rides through onto
            :attr:`DerivedPeriod.period_id`.  Empty is a legal input and yields
            an empty calendar -- a user who has never generated a schedule, and
            the companion role, which by design holds no paydays of its own.
        eras: The owner's pay eras, ``effective_from`` ascending and
            NON-EMPTY (:class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Era`, one per
            ``budget.pay_eras`` row): each carries the day its rhythm took
            effect, which is the grid's PHASE, and the rhythm itself.  Read
            only for the LAST period's end -- every other end is dictated by
            the next recorded payday -- and through :func:`~._eras.payday_after`, so
            the end lands on the grid of the era covering the last payday
            rather than one cadence past the day the bank happened to pay
            (plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-b-2``; ledger rows **N-495**,
            **N-492**).  Validated EAGERLY, before the paydays are looked at
            (:func:`validate_eras`): a bad sequence is a bad caller whether or
            not this owner has paydays yet, and refusing it only when the data
            reaches the projection branch would hide it until the day a user
            records their first payday.
            **It was a single :class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm` until
            ``C17-b-2``** -- the schedule row's one cadence and convention,
            then the LATEST era's at ``C17-a`` -- and a bare ``cadence_days``
            until ``C14-e-1``, which threaded the pair ahead of ``C14-e-3``
            making :func:`~._eras.projected_payday` the nominal day displaced under
            the owner's convention.  The sequence travels as one value for the
            reason the pair did: passed apart, one owner's cadence could be
            paired with another's convention or phase.
            **It is not optional, since plan step C4-d** (ruling **R-PC45**).
            The cadence was ``int | None``, ``None`` being legal beside an
            empty payday set and REFUSED beside a non-empty one -- a pairing
            this function policed at runtime for every caller, in twenty
            lines, because the type would not.  The absence it stood for was
            an owner with no ``budget.pay_schedule`` row, and that owner now
            has no CALENDAR: :func:`~._loader.calendar_for` refuses them
            rather than building an empty one with no rhythm, so nothing
            constructs the pair and there is nothing here to refuse.  An owner
            with an era and zero paydays is unaffected and still ordinary --
            they have a real rhythm and an empty calendar, which is what
            ``pay_period_admin.reset_pay_periods`` passes through.

    Returns:
        The owner's periods, ``start_date`` ascending, ``period_index`` running
        0..n-1 in that order.  Empty for an empty payday set.

    Raises:
        PayCalendarError: Anything :func:`validate_eras` refuses -- no era, an
            era whose cadence is not an ``int`` (``None`` included) or falls

            no payday; a ``period_id`` is neither
            an ``int`` nor ``None``; a payday is not a ``datetime.date``, or
            is a ``datetime.datetime`` (which is a ``date`` subclass and would
            silently give every derived end a time component); or a payday

    without re-checking it, so a bad one refused here is refused once rather
    than answered wrongly four ways.  Four things are refused, and each is a
    state the storage or the write door already keeps a STORED sequence out

      past the covering era's second payday whenever the record holds that
      era's first (ruling 2026-09-11, after an adversarial review of
      ``C17-b-2`` drove a legal sequence past a floor that saw only the

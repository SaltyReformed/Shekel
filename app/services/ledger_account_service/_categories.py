"""The per-CATEGORY chart rows, and the door to the per-owner Uncategorized fallback.

Build-Order Step 3's half of the chart of accounts: the counter-leg side an
ordinary settled transaction's category leg books into.  One Income or Expense
ledger account per budget category per accounting class, plus the
per-(owner, class) ``Uncategorized`` bucket that catches a transaction whose
``category_id`` is NULL -- which since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3`` (ruling
**R-BAL99**) is one of the OWNER-BUCKET family :mod:`._buckets` resolves; this
module's door keeps its signature and delegates the fallback there.

Unlike a linked row a category row carries a ``category_id`` and a NULL
``account_id``, and snapshots a display ``name`` frozen at creation so
renaming a budgeting category never rewrites posted history.

Flask-isolated and commit-free: plain data in, ORM objects out; the caller owns
the transaction boundary.

    Truncated to :data:`._common.LEDGER_ACCOUNT_NAME_MAX_LEN` so a long
    "Group: Item" (up to ~202 chars) always fits the ``name`` column; the label
    is display-only, so the clip is lossless for logic, and the equivalent
    ``LEFT(group || ': ' || item, <len>)`` in the Step-7 backfill yields the
    identical string (the backfill==go-forward invariant).

    Filtered by the owning ``user_id``, not loaded by bare primary key: a
    ``Category`` is user-scoped data, so this honours the project rule that
    every query touching user data filters by ``user_id`` and matches the
    sibling :func:`_find_existing_category_ledger_account` lookup.  A
    ``category_id`` belonging to another user is therefore treated as "not

    The Build-Order Step 3 counter-leg resolver: an ordinary settled

    ledger account, and this lazily materialises (and thereafter reuses)
    that account.  A transaction with no category books into the
    per-(owner, class) ``Uncategorized`` fallback instead.

    Idempotent (:func:`._common.resolve_chart_row`): an existing row for the
    natural key is returned unchanged (the matching partial unique index --
    ``uq_ledger_accounts_category`` for a category row,
    ``uq_ledger_accounts_owner_bucket`` for a fallback -- would otherwise
    reject a duplicate).  A category used for both an
    income and an expense transaction correctly yields TWO rows, one per
    class, because the natural key includes ``class_id`` (a ``Category`` is
    type-agnostic).

    The created category row leaves ``account_id`` NULL (it is a counter
    account, not a real-account mirror), snapshots its display ``name`` (the
    category's ``"Group: Item"``) and stamps the ``category`` kind.  The
    FALLBACK arm is the owner-bucket family's since plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-6-3`` (ruling **R-BAL99**): this door keeps its signature
    -- every caller asks it for "the counter account of this row" without
    knowing whether the row has a category -- and delegates a ``None``
    category to :func:`._buckets.get_or_create_owner_bucket`, which stamps
    the ``fallback`` kind, ``is_owner_bucket`` True and the canonical
    ``"Uncategorized {Income|Expense}"`` label.  Neither arm ever creates or
    reuses an **orphan** (``is_owner_bucket`` False, ``category_id`` NULL):
    orphans arise only from a category delete's SET NULL and are left
    untouched (the bucket lookup keys on the flag, never on ``category_id IS
    NULL``).

    Flushes so the new row's ``id`` is assigned, but does NOT commit -- the
    caller (``posting_service``, Step 3 Commit 4) owns the transaction
    boundary.

    Args:
        user_id: The owning user's id.  Sourced by the caller from
            ``txn.user_id``; it was ``txn.pay_period.user_id`` until plan step
            ``pay_calendar:C13-b`` moved it, one hydration cheaper for the
            same value.  A read that STAMPS rather than refuses, so it was
            never one of finding **P75**'s nineteen -- that census excludes it
            by name -- and what moved it is the rule that a row's owner has
            ONE home.
        category_id: The budget category's id, or None to resolve the

            :class:`~app.enums.LedgerAccountClassEnum` member that MUST be

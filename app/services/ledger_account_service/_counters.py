"""The per-ACCOUNT chart rows that hold an anchor correction's counter leg.

Build-Order Step 5's half of the chart of accounts, extended by ruling
**R-FO** (plan step X-f3d).  A non-loan account's ``account_opening`` /
``account_trueup`` corrections are balanced two-leg entries: one leg moves the
account's own linked row, and the other -- the COUNTER leg -- lands here, which
is what makes every non-loan linked ledger sum to an ABSOLUTE balance and
closes the app-wide trial balance.

**WHICH row it lands in says what the difference WAS**, and that is a total
dispatch over the account's projection kind
(:func:`anchor_correction_counter_kind`):

* ``anchor_equity`` (Equity) -- an account's OPENING, whatever its kind, and
  every ``PLAIN`` account's true-up until plan step X-f3c makes that residual a
  recorded, user-accepted transaction (ruling **R-FN**).
* ``interest_income`` (Income) -- an ``INTEREST`` account's true-up.
* ``unrealized_change`` (``UNREALIZED``) -- an ``INVESTMENT`` or
  ``APPRECIATING`` account's true-up: other comprehensive income, reported
  below the net-income line so a revaluation is never read as earnings.

All three share one column shape (``account_id`` set, ``category_id`` /
``loan_account_id`` NULL, ``is_fallback`` False) and one natural key,
``uq_ledger_accounts_account_kind``'s ``(account_id, kind_id)`` -- so they
coexist with the ``linked`` row and with each other under an index that already
existed, and no new index is needed.  Unlike a linked row each ALWAYS snapshots
a display ``name``: the COALESCE display rule is the LINKED-row rule, so
readers render this row's snapshot.

The loan analogue is :mod:`._loans`' ``equity_opening`` kind; the two families
never overlap, because :func:`_load_non_loan_account` rejects amortizing loans
here and ``_load_amortizing_loan_account`` rejects everything else there.

Flask-isolated and commit-free: plain data in, ORM objects out; the caller owns
the transaction boundary.

    the house appreciated by its whole value on the day it was recorded, and a

    ``LoanAnchorEvent``-driven loan path onto their per-loan

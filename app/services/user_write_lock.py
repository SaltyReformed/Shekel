"""
Shekel Budget App -- The per-user write lock

ONE transaction-scoped PostgreSQL advisory lock, keyed on the owning user, so
two writes of one user's data that both take it never overlap (the writers
that take none are named below).  **Since plan step
``balance:X-bn`` it is taken from exactly two modules** (rulings **R-CC106**,
**R-CC114**, **R-CC115**, **R-CC121**): :mod:`app.db_transaction`, at the
start of every command transaction a signed-in request opens -- before it
reads any of the owner's data; the signed-in user's own row and the role row
joined to it, read to sign the request in, are the only rows read first, and
the user's row is re-read under the lock -- and at a sign-in right after the
account is found; and this module's :func:`lock_every_user_writes`, at the
start of each deploy reconcile.  No service takes it for itself any more, and
``tests/test_arch/test_the_owner_lock_has_one_home.py`` refuses one that
tries.  **The writers that take none, each named so it is not mistaken for
covered**: registration (``/register`` and ``scripts/seed_user.py``) writes a
user that is not committed, so no other transaction can reach it; and every
script that writes an EXISTING user's rows holds no request, so nothing takes
the lock for it.  The deploy reconciles take every owner's at their own start.
Four operator scripts write rows the lock covers and take none --
``scripts/reset_mfa.py`` (``mfa_configs``), ``scripts/rotate_totp_key.py``
(every ``totp_secret_encrypted``), ``scripts/rotate_sessions.py`` (every
``users.session_invalidated_at``) and ``scripts/seed_companion.py``'s
existing-user branch (``role_id`` and ``linked_owner_id``, the lock's key) --
so each can race a sign-in or an MFA door that holds the lock (reported at
plan step ``balance:X-bn``'s checkpoint 4 review, 2026-09-29).  *It was
taken by sixteen calls in nine modules inside the write paths that needed it
most, plus three that plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4`` put inside
``row_write_lock`` (the row locks' module, deleted with them at plan step
``balance:X-bn``), each taking it at its own point in the transaction, which
is what made the deadlock below reachable.*

Two families of write are why the lock exists at all, and they need the SAME
lock because the second reads the first's output:

* **The structural pay-period mutations** -- top-up / extend / truncate, and so
  regenerate and reset, which are compositions of those.  Each counts or
  classifies the user's periods and then appends or deletes against that count.
* **Every posting-ledger RECONCILE** -- the cash anchor reconcile
  (:mod:`app.services.account_posting_service`) and the loan reconcile
  (:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service`).  Each reads what the ledger has
  posted, subtracts it from what the account's facts say it should hold, and
  writes the difference.

**Why one lock and not two.**  A reconcile does not only read the account's
ledger: it derives each correction's pay period from the OWNER'S CALENDAR
(:meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period`, loaded through
:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.filing_calendar_for`), and
``journal_entries.pay_period_id`` is an ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` FK.  So a
concurrent truncate can delete the very period a reconcile is filing under, and
the correction it just wrote goes with it.  The consistency boundary of a
reconcile is therefore the user's ledger AND the calendar it keys on -- the
union, which is exactly this lock's subject.  It is also one KEY per user, so
no transaction has to order two of them against each other.

**Deadlock: what one key does and does not buy, corrected on evidence.**  An
earlier version of this docstring said deadlock was "structurally impossible on
every request path".  **That was FALSE, and a neutral adversarial review
reproduced the cycle**, because the argument considered only
advisory-vs-advisory ordering while this lock was taken in transactions that
also held ROW locks.  The cycle, as it stood until plan step ``balance:X-bn``:

* A settle took row locks FIRST.  ``update_transfer`` UPDATEd the transfer and
  both shadow transactions, those flushed, and only then did the posting sync
  reach this lock -- measured at statements 2-4 and 19 of one loan-payment
  settle.
* A truncate or reset took this lock first and then bulk-DELETEd pay periods,
  which CASCADE to ``budget.transactions`` and so took row locks on exactly
  the rows a concurrent settle might hold.

Two such transactions, same user, opposite orders: PostgreSQL detected it and
aborted one with ``DeadlockDetected``.  **No money was corrupted** -- the loser
rolled back atomically -- but the victim was an unhandled 500 on a money route.
It needed a settle and a schedule rebuild for one user to overlap, which is two
browser tabs, and it did not exist before this lock did.

**The real invariant, stated so the next author can hold it: this lock must be
the FIRST lock a transaction takes.**  *Until plan step ``balance:X-bn`` it was
a property each write door had to hold for itself, and most did not: the
settle paths took row locks first (finding **N-193**), plan step
``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4`` (ruling **R-CC100**) added the lock ahead of the row
locks it introduced, and a census over the whole suite (2026-09-24) still
found 27 endpoints that locked a row and then asked for this lock in the same
request -- the popover's Save, a purchase's edit and delete, carry-forward and
the reconcile tick among them.*  **It is now structural on every request
path**: the lock is taken where each command transaction a signed-in request
opens begins (:mod:`app.db_transaction`), so the only earlier statement is
the signed-in user's own row, and no row lock rides on it.  **The deploy is the
one place it is not first, and what keeps that safe is an ORDER, not this
module**: the deploy reconciles take every owner's lock, ascending, at the
start of each reconcile FUNCTION, but ``scripts/init_database.py`` runs them
in the one transaction that has already run the migrations and the
infrastructure DDL, with their table locks.  That is safe because
``entrypoint.sh`` runs ``init_database.py`` before it hands over to gunicorn,
so no request can hold an owner's lock while the deploy waits.  If that
order ever changes, a request could take owner A's lock, block on a migrated
table, and deadlock against the deploy waiting on A.

Shipping the lock with a detected-and-rolled-back deadlock was strictly better
than shipping the silent ledger divergence it replaced; shipping it with a
docstring claiming the deadlock impossible was not, which is why this
paragraph said so until the step that made it so.

**Why a lock at all, rather than a constraint.**  A reconcile emits the
DIFFERENCE between target and posted, and repeated deltas under one key are the
design (a correction whose basis moves is adjusted by a further entry, never
edited -- the ledger is append-only).  No unique index can distinguish a
legitimate second delta from a racing duplicate.  Nor can the read take a row
lock: when nothing is posted yet there are no rows to lock, which is the
classic phantom.  A predicate lock is what is wanted, and in PostgreSQL that is
either SERIALIZABLE isolation with a retry loop in every route, or an advisory
lock.  This is the advisory lock.

**Why the reconcile ever appeared to be safe.**  Until plan step X-f1c3c a cash
true-up also UPDATEd ``accounts``, and that UPDATE autoflushed and took a row
lock BEFORE the walk -- serialising the reconcile by accident, through a column
that had nothing to do with it.  Ruling R-EN deleted the column and with it the
accident.  Measured, with the interleave forced at the reconcile's read: two
concurrent true-ups on an account reconciled at ``$4,000.00`` both answer 200,
and the account's linked ledger settles at ``$1,000.00`` while its resolved
assertion reads ``$2,000.00`` -- both sides wrong, trial balance still
``$0.00`` because the anchor-equity leg mirrors the error, so nothing fails
loudly.  The LOAN reconcile never had even the accident: it is fed by an
append-only event table, so it has carried the same race since Commit 16, and
ruling R-EN cited it as the precedent to copy.

Transaction-scoped: PostgreSQL releases the lock at COMMIT or ROLLBACK, so it
cannot leak -- and a request that commits and goes on writing takes it again
in its next transaction (:mod:`app.db_transaction`).  Re-entrant, and one
caller relies on that: ``scripts/init_database.py`` runs the three deploy
reconciles in ONE transaction, and each takes every owner's lock again.  A
request's transaction takes it once: at its start, or, at a sign-in, right
after the account is found.

Flask-isolated -- takes and returns plain data, never imports ``request`` /
``session``.  Takes no transaction of its own: the caller owns the boundary,
and the lock lives exactly as long as that transaction.

    :func:`lock_every_user_writes` for the deploy reconciles (the module

    holding the same key commits or rolls back; PostgreSQL releases it
    automatically at this transaction's end.

    **On a CONNECTION, never through the session**: a session statement

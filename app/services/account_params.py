"""
Shekel Budget App -- the rule that a parameterised account carries its satellite

**One statement of "an account of a parameterised kind has its params row", for
every door that can establish that kind.**  Plan step **balance:X-i3**, finding
**N-359**.

**FIVE doors set an account's projection kind, and until this module only the
first held the rule**:

1. creating an account (``routes.accounts.crud.create_account``);
2. re-classing one onto a different type (``crud.update_account``);
3. editing the TYPE itself, so every account already on it changes kind
   (``routes.accounts.types.update_account_type``, which may flip
   ``has_interest`` and ``has_parameters`` on an owner's own custom type, with
   no account row touched at all);
4. :func:`app.ref_seeds.seed_reference_data`, which rewrites every BUILT-IN
   type's flags in place on every container start -- so an edit to
   ``ACCT_TYPE_SEEDS`` re-classes those accounts for every owner at deploy;
5. a data migration doing the same by hand, which has shipped both ways
   already: ``2c1115378030`` flipped ``has_interest`` on Money Market and CD
   and backfilled, at a `0.04500` default that ``E-12`` / ``HIGH-06`` later
   banned, while ``98b1adb05030`` flipped ``has_parameters`` on 529 Plan and
   backfilled nothing.

**Doors 1-3 hold it here. Doors 4 and 5 do NOT, and that is N-359's**, along
with ``account_service.create_account`` -- the canonical factory, which builds a
parameterised account with no satellite row and whose contract a dozen
docstrings describe.

**It lives in the SERVICE tier for a reason that is a gate rather than a
preference.**  Its first home was ``app/routes/accounts/_type_params.py``, and
``shekel-private-module-import`` (W9910) forbids anything outside that package
from importing a private module of it in any spelling -- so ``ref_seeds`` and
``account_service``, doors 4 and 6, could not have reached the rule at all.  A
home that makes the remaining doors unfixable is the wrong home; an adversarial
review of this step made that argument and it is correct.

**What it cost while only door 1 held it.**  Two detail pages and the settings
dashboard each carried an auto-create for the missing row, repairing data on a
GET -- a write inside a read, which cost those pages the one snapshot every
figure on them is computed against (:mod:`app.db_transaction`) and hid the doors
that owed the row.  Deleting those repairs is only honest once the rule holds
where the kind is decided.

**Idempotent by construction, and that is what lets door 3 be simple.**  Each
arm asks whether the row exists before adding one, so a caller may run it over
every account of a type without first working out which of them changed kind --
and working that out would mean a second copy of
:func:`~app.services.account_projection.classify_account`'s branch order, which
is the "second answer to one question" these arcs keep deleting.

Flask-isolated, and it does not commit: the caller owns the transaction
boundary, as all three do.

    loan's terms are :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`, written by
    its own setup flow.

    deliberately: a re-class back restores the settings the owner had, and an
    unread satellite costs nothing but a row.

"""The paycheck engine's owner-level input: a salary profile and its calendar.

Plan step **R-F16** (``docs/plans/implementation_plan_recurrence_redesign.md``,
"Carried steps").  Its own module rather than a type inside
:mod:`app.services.paycheck_calculator`, which sits at the 1000-line ceiling
this step's own additions pushed it past -- and because nine modules outside
that one CONSTRUCT this value while only it computes a paycheck, so the input
has more consumers than the producer does.  Every one of the nine imports it
from HERE; an earlier draft of this sentence made the consumer argument while
all nine still reached the type through the engine, which is a claim its own
import graph refuted.

No Flask, no clock, no database access of its own.  What it reads off the
profile it is handed -- the raise rows, since plan step salary:R15-b each
deduction's recurrence rule, and since salary:X-av-3a the pay list -- it reads
as ATTRIBUTES the caller loaded (the engine's loader eager-loads all three;
``test_projection_inputs`` counts the
statements a walk issues and finds none), converting each to a value through
the reader that owns its vocabulary: :func:`~app.services.salary_raises
.terms_of` for a raise, :func:`~app.services.recurrence.recurrence_spec` for
a rule.  The profile is typed loosely on purpose (see the class).

    took the owner's period SET as a separate argument -- so the paycheck count
    and the paydays it counted arrived by two routes with nothing holding them
    to one owner or one read.  Four of the engine's judgements read that
    argument (third-paycheck detection, the first-paycheck-of-month deduction
    cadence, the FICA wage-base cumulative and a deduction's annual cap), its
    type was ``Sequence[DerivedPeriod]``, and every window, year slice and
    one-period sample satisfied that type: passing one cost a stored salary row
    **$502.45** (ledger row **D25**).  A calendar is constructible only from a
    COMPLETE payday set, so the narrow context is now unrepresentable rather
    than forbidden by a docstring, and the cadence comes off the same
    derivation as the paydays.  That closed finding **N-390**'s first half;
    the second -- what the calendar can answer BELOW its opening payday --
    closed at plan step **balance:X-bh-2**, which gave the calendar the owner's
    stored ``history_opens_on`` and made its rhythm run in both directions.

    **The pair, as one value, is plan step R-F16's fix for finding F-16.**  The
    engine needs two facts to price a paycheck -- what the job pays a year, and
    how many paychecks that year holds -- and until this step they travelled
    separately: the salary profile carried its own ``pay_periods_per_year``
    column (a 12 / 24 / 26 / 52 dropdown) while
    ``budget.pay_schedule.cadence_days`` carried the payday rhythm, and no door
    validated one against the other.  Measured with the real engine on a
    ``$91,675`` salary, a profile saying 26 beside a 7-day cadence modelled
    ``$15,279.20`` of monthly gross against a true ``$7,639.60`` -- the year's
    paychecks summing to 200% of salary.  Only 5 of the 365 legal cadences had
    a dropdown value that could agree with them at all, so validating the pair
    was not an available remedy: the count had to become a derivation.

    Binding them makes the mismatched pair unrepresentable rather than merely
    discouraged -- the same argument the read-pass ruling makes for
    ``BalanceContext`` -- and there is now ONE derivation of the count,
    :attr:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCadence.periods_per_year`, which is
    also what every monthly-equivalent conversion in the application reads.
    A salary profile's paycheck recurs every pay period BY DEFINITION (it is
    what ``routes.salary.profiles._paycheck_template`` authors), so there was
    never a per-profile count for the dropped column to hold.

    only raise set a paycheck could ever be priced under was the one stored,
    and a what-if over a raise's end year (the ``/retirement`` rail's per-raise
    probe, plan step **salary:S3-f**) had no input to arrive through.  The
    set is an INPUT of this value now: the profile's own rows' terms unless a
    caller supplies :attr:`raise_terms`, and every engine read goes through
    :attr:`raises`, which is always a tuple of
    :class:`~app.services.salary_raises.RaiseTerms` -- the VALUE whose fields
    are the engine's whole contract with a raise.  The stored plan is
    unchanged by construction: a basis built without terms prices exactly the
    figures its rows carry, read through the same walk.

    Attributes:
        profile: The ``SalaryProfile`` -- read for its pay list, the
            deductions and the W-4 inputs, and for the raises when no
            :attr:`raise_terms` are supplied.  Typed loosely because every
            consumer reads attributes rather than the ORM class, and because
            this module must not import a model (the engine below it is
            pure).  The test suite prices duck-typed profiles through the same
            door for that reason.
        calendar: The owner's whole
            :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar` -- the payday set
            every calendar question the engine asks is answered from, and the
            eras whose rhythm :meth:`base_pay_on` prices each payday at.  ONE
            value because they are one fact: the cadence is a field of the
            calendar, so a paycheck cannot be priced at one rhythm and placed
            in a month counted at another.
        raise_terms: The raise set to price from INSTEAD of the profile's
            rows, as a tuple of :class:`~app.services.salary_raises.RaiseTerms`,
            or ``None`` for the rows' own terms -- the default, and what every

            (:meth:`~app.services.income_service.PaycheckPricing.for_profile`)
            passes the canonical tuple for every set, the stored one included.
            A ``None`` here does NOT stand for a stored number the way the

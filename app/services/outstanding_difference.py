"""What an account's books cannot explain, and what has CHECKED those days.

Plan step **balance:X-f3c-3** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``
section 5).  Two facts that only mean anything together, resolved in ONE call:

* the OUTSTANDING DIFFERENCE -- the owner's latest declared balance less what
  the account's books produce for that same day, which is
  :func:`app.services.balance_at.cash_outstanding_difference`;
* whether an imported bank statement RECONCILES the days that difference
  accumulated over, which is a reading of
  :func:`app.services.bank_agreement.bank_agreement`.

**Money-neutral.**  Nothing here writes, and nothing here offers an act: the
figure is the INSTRUMENT plan step X-f3c-4 needs, and the act that ACCEPTS it
as an ordinary uncategorized transaction is that step (ruling **R-FN**).

**Why the two travel together, and why that is this module rather than the
route.**  A difference the books cannot explain means one thing over a span the
bank has confirmed line by line and quite another over a span nobody has
imported -- ruling **R-GY** turns exactly that into X-f3c-4's offer gate.  The
span the verdict must be about is the DIFFERENCE's own
(:class:`~app.services.balance_at.BooksSpan`, carried on the difference), so a
caller that resolved the two halves separately would hold a figure and a span
as independent arguments and could pair them wrongly -- the shape finding
**N-354** closed one layer down.  One door, one account, nothing left to pair.

**Its own module rather than four more values in** :mod:`.bank_agreement`,
and the reason is measured rather than tidy: that module stood at 797 lines of
pylint's 1000-line ceiling before this step and the first build of this leaf
put it at **993**, seven lines of headroom for whoever touches it next.
Findings **N-152**, **N-156** and **N-201** record the same ceiling on three
other service modules and rule the same answer -- a split on the seam, never
another round of shaving prose off a measured claim.  The seam is real: that
module owns the per-DAY comparison, and this owns a reading of it beside a
figure from a different package.

**It also TAKES THAT VERDICT APART** (plan step **balance:X-bk-1**, ruling
**R-BAL232**): :func:`disagreement_list` cuts the same span into back-to-back
stretches, grades each with the one grader (:func:`span_agreement`) the whole
span's verdict comes from, and names what differs on every day that
disagrees.  It is the list the one-time reconcile of the imported bank
history (plan step X-bk-2) is written from, and the measurement that step
re-runs to show it is done.  No route reads it -- the ruling's own words are
"no screen changes" -- and its one caller is
``tests/manual/measure_bank_disagreements.py``, run against a production
COPY.

    the error to the cent.  So what this value counts is DAYS, and it carries

            the one hole no count over the report's own days can see, because a
            quiet day inside a run and a quiet day outside one look identical.

    Plan step **balance:X-bk-1**, ruling **R-BAL232**: the books span
    :func:`outstanding_difference` grades as ONE verdict, cut into back-to-back
    :class:`Stretch` values of one :class:`StretchKind` each, every one graded
    by :func:`span_agreement`, with each disagreeing day's bank lines and app
    rows -- plus the imported days either side of the span, set apart.

    **One span, one comparison, resolved once** (:func:`_both_halves`), so
    the list and the card's verdict cannot be about different days: the span
    is the outstanding difference's own, and that pairing is the shape finding
    **N-354** closed.

    Args:
        account: The account to list.  Must belong to ``ctx.user_id``, which
            the read pass REFUSES rather than trusts.  Must be attached to
            ``db.session``.
        ctx: The read pass's
            :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`.

    Returns:
        The :class:`DisagreementList`, or ``None`` in each case
        :func:`outstanding_difference` has no verdict for: a MODELLED kind or a
        loan (ruling **R-FO**), an account that has asserted nothing, and an
        account holding no recorded bank line at all.  An absence rather than
        an empty list, for the reason :class:`OutstandingDifference` gives:
        "nobody imported a statement" is not "nothing disagrees".

    Raises:
        BaselineMissingError: When *ctx* carries no baseline scenario.
        ForeignAccountError: When *account* belongs to another owner.
        PayCalendarError: When the owner's paydays cannot define a calendar,
            and :exc:`RuntimeError` when a planned row names a pay period that
            calendar does not hold -- both from the fold, as in
            :func:`outstanding_difference`.

    **What it costs, and why that is acceptable here and would not be on a
    page.**  Each disagreeing day's detail walks the account's cash ledger
    again (:func:`~app.services.bank_agreement.day_detail`), and each day the
    comparison drew is graded on its own before the stretches are merged --
    at most 731 of them, each a pass over the same at most 731 days.  The one
    caller is a measurement run by hand against a copy.

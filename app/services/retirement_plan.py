"""
Shekel Budget App -- The Retirement Picture At A Plan Point (C2-f2d-2)

**ONE producer of "what does this retirement plan look like", and the ONE
loader a ``/retirement`` render runs on.**

Until plan step C2-f2d-2 there were two implementations of that one thing.
``retirement_dashboard_service.compute_gap_data`` computed the picture at the
STORED retirement date under optional what-if sliders; ``retirement_levers._probe``
computed it at a SHIFTED retirement date under the stored sliders.  They are the
same function over a union of parameters, written twice -- and on the default page
load the lever solver's month-0 probe recomputed, from its own loaded inputs, the
exact picture the readiness hero had already drawn beside it.  Measured on a
production clone: funded ratio ``0.7463``, required ``$1,120,707.00``, projected
after tax ``$836,398.65``, derived twice and agreeing.  Ledger row **P57**.

Agreeing is not the same as being one answer.  Two derivations agree until
somebody edits one of them, and nothing in the app can notice the day they part
-- the page would simply show a funded verdict and a lever card solved against a
different plan, both stated as fact.  This module replaces the second derivation
rather than reconciling it.

**The two values that make it one producer.**

* :class:`PlanPoint` -- WHICH plan, RESOLVED: the withdrawal rate this plan is
  solved at, whether it came from the settings or from a what-if slider, the
  assumed return, the retire-later lever's month offset, and -- since plan step
  salary:S3-f-2b -- the end year each recurring raise is BELIEVED through,
  whether it came from the raise's row or from the rail's probe.  It is frozen
  and hashable because it is the memo key, and resolved because a memo key must
  be CANONICAL -- two spellings of one plan are the two derivations this module
  exists to remove.  Built through :attr:`RetirementInputs.stored_plan` and
  :meth:`RetirementInputs.plan_with`.
* :class:`RetirementInputs` -- everything a render loads, loaded ONCE, and
  point-INDEPENDENT by construction: the read pass, the gap inputs, the stored
  retirement date, the projection context and its batch.  A point never reloads
  any of it, which is why the retire-later binary search can probe ten candidate
  dates for the price of one query set.

:func:`picture_at` is the join: it derives the picture at a point and memoizes it
on the inputs, so the readiness hero and the lever card asking for the same point
receive the same :class:`RetirementPicture` object rather than two equal ones.

All functions take plain data and return plain data.  No Flask imports.

    Frozen and hashable because it is :func:`picture_at`'s memo key, and the

    object instead of two equal ones.  **A memo key must therefore be CANONICAL:
    two spellings of one plan are two derivations of one figure, which is the
    defect (row **P57**) this module exists to remove.**

    So the assumption a what-if can move is stored here as the VALUE it
    resolves to, not as the override it arrived as.  The first draft stored
    overrides, and it was measured wrong the same day (adversarial design
    review, 2026-08-16): every saveable row in the assumptions rail renders
    pre-filled with its stored value, so every real fragment request ships that
    value back as an "override".  ``PlanPoint(swr_override=Decimal("0.04"))``
    and ``PlanPoint()`` are then two keys for one plan, and the what-if panel
    derives its baseline and its "override" as two full projections agreeing in
    every digit -- P57's own sentence, restated inside the step that closed it.
    Resolved values cannot express that: 4% is 4% whichever door it came
    through.  *It was measured on the merit-horizon row, which plan step
    salary:S3-c deleted (ruling **R-SAL11**: a raise's end year is a fact on
    the raise); the rail's remaining saveable rows are pre-filled the same way,

        month_offset: Whole months added to EACH qualifying pension's own
            planned retirement date -- the retire-later lever's search axis.
            It stays a delta where the other two became values, and the reason
            is in :func:`app.services.retirement_dashboard_service.compute_pension_summary`:
            the offset shifts every pension SEPARATELY, growing each one's years
            of service and high-salary window from its own date.  An owner with
            pensions dated 2044 and 2046 delayed by a year retires against 2045
            AND 2047, which one resolved date cannot say.  ``0`` is the stored
            plan (:func:`app.utils.dates.add_months` with 0 months is the
            identity).
        swr: The fractional safe-withdrawal rate this plan is solved at, already
            resolved from the what-if or the stored settings.
        return_rate_override: A fractional annual return applied UNIFORMLY to
            every account, or ``None`` -- and this one is genuinely an OVERRIDE
            rather than a resolved value, because ``None`` does not stand for a
            stored number.  It means "each account grows at its own stored
            rate", which no single rate expresses.  Its input renders empty for

    **Nothing here is re-read per plan**, which is what makes one load serve

    them queries.  What DOES vary with the point -- the salary path, the
    pension benefit, the projection axis and the per-account walk (the employer
    salary basis too, until salary:S3-e-2) -- is derived in :func:`picture_at`
    from these.  So is the current paycheck since plan step salary:S3-f-2a,
    derived per point off the pass's pricer, and so are the payroll feeds
    since salary:S3-f-2b; both vary with the point only through its raise
    set.  For a profile that funds no account, the FIRST derivation at a set
    is where that profile's tax series loads (three queries the loader issued
    itself before), and every later point at that set is the memo's.

    **The precise invariant, because "point-independent" is not quite true of
    ``base_ctx`` and an earlier draft of this paragraph claimed it was**
    (adversarial reviews, 2026-08-16): that context carries a
    ``planned_retirement_date`` and a ``return_rate_override``, both of which
    :func:`_derive_picture` replaces per point.  Sharing one ``batch`` across
    plans is therefore safe because of a property of the LOADER, not of the
    context: :func:`~app.services.retirement_projection.load_projection_batch`
    reads only ``balance_ctx`` and ``accounts`` -- never the horizon, the
    return override or the employer basis.  (It read two PERIOD fields as well
    until pay-calendar plan step C2-f2d-3 deleted them from that context; both
    are derived from ``balance_ctx`` now, which this list already named, so the
    property is unchanged and the surface it rests on is smaller.)
    Teaching it to read one of those would silently hand every
    point in a render the stored plan's batch, so the property is pinned by
    ``tests/test_services/test_retirement_plan.py``'s
    ``TestTheBatchIsHorizonIndependent`` rather than left to this note.

            salary:S3-f-2a: it is a function of the point, derived below.)
        base_date: The STORED plan's resolved retirement date (a pension's beats
            the settings', latest pension wins), or ``None`` when neither
            supplies one -- the page's no-horizon state.
        base_ctx: The account set and period calendar the projection runs over,
            as a context.  Its three point-dependent fields are placeholders --
            :func:`_derive_picture` replaces all three for every point,
            including the stored one -- so the employer salary basis is left
            ``None`` here rather than built and thrown away, which is what an
            earlier draft did once per render for nothing.
        batch: The date-independent projection batch (payroll wiring and its

        point: The :class:`PlanPoint` this is the picture OF.
        retirement_date: The horizon this picture was projected to -- the stored
            date shifted by ``point.month_offset`` -- or ``None`` when the owner
            has set no retirement date at all.

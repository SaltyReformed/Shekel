"""Loan-detail display read producers: the Loop B rebuild's measured surfaces.

The display read side of the genesis loan sub-ledger: the loan DETAIL page's
two measured surfaces, both shaped from the ONE walk the postings are
reconciled from (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`):

* the confirmed payment-history table (:func:`confirmed_loan_payment_history`,
  each payment's real cash / principal / interest / escrow split); and
* the balance-anchors drift scorecard (:func:`loan_balance_anchor_history`, each
  opening / true-up paired with what the ledger had computed just before it).

**The payment table reads the WALK, not the ledger's legs** (plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-3``, ruling **R-BAL102**).  Through that step a reader
module beside this one (``_reader``, deleted) summed each payment's posted
interest / escrow / principal legs back out of the ledger by the loan-side
shadow's ``transaction_id``, so the table would "cross-check the writer".  The
split is a date-keyed correction with no row link now, and two payments on
one day in one period share ONE entry, so the ledger cannot say which payment
paid what -- and never needed to: the E1a write-time assert
(:func:`._sync._assert_checked_projection`) already grades the posted ledger
against this same walk per date, and a display-side second grade was a
checker.  The paid-in-year chips moved OFF the postings onto the fold at step
C6c (:func:`app.services.balance_at.loan_interest_paid_in_year` /
:func:`~app.services.balance_at.loan_principal_paid_in_year`), so this module
no longer answers them.  Reads only -- no writes, no commit.

    The display row of :func:`confirmed_loan_payment_history`: a single confirmed
    payment's outcome in the genesis walk, carrying the ACTUAL cash paid and its
    real principal / interest / escrow split (the walk's allocation of what
    moved, not the schedule's contractual replay -- so an extra or short
    payment shows honestly).  Every row is confirmed by construction (the
    producer bounds to payments whose CASH had moved by ``as_of``), so the

    ``cash`` is the payment's full cash (the loan-side income shadow's
    :func:`~app.services.row_valuation.settled_contribution`, read once by the
    walk's event); ``principal + interest + escrow`` equals it for an
    ordinary payment.  The one case they diverge is a payoff OVERPAYMENT, whose
    surplus is a lender refund (a receivable) rather than principal -- there
    ``cash`` exceeds the split sum by that refund; see
    :func:`~app.utils.money.apply_payment_cash`.  A SECOND payment inside one
    accrual period is the other shape worth expecting: it clears no fresh charge,
    so its ``interest`` and ``escrow`` are ``0.00`` and its ``principal`` alone
    equals its cash (plan step X-au-g-2c-3b-2).

        principal: The real debt paid down, cent-quantized; may be negative

            linked ledger by the split's construction (``cash - interest -

"""Loan-payment correction posting: the per-payment split's TARGET legs.

The REAL principal / interest / escrow / refund split of a confirmed loan
payment, as the balanced CORRECTION the ledger layers on top of the payment's
cash movement (:mod:`app.services._posting_purchases`, plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-3``: the loan-side covering movement's own entry
``Loan +cash / Transit -cash``).  That entry dumps the ENTIRE cash onto the
loan, when only the PRINCIPAL portion pays the debt down.  Because a posted
entry is immutable, the ledger appends a second balanced entry that moves the
non-principal off the loan::

    Loan     -(interest + escrow + excess)   [principal]
    Interest +interest                        [interest -> Expense]
    Escrow   +escrow                          [escrow   -> Expense]
    Refund   +excess                          [refund   -> Asset]
             --------------------------------
             0

The loan's NET (the cash leg + this correction) is then exactly the real
principal paid.  The split (:mod:`app.services.loan_ledger`) is computed from
the ACTUAL cash (``principal = cash - interest - escrow``), so an extra or short
payment is captured honestly -- and a payment of ``$0.00`` (a missed
installment recorded as paid) carries the whole standing charge as an
underpayment, growing the debt by exactly the interest and escrow it did not
clear.

**A DERIVATION, keyed like one: ``(loan_payment kind, the payment's pay
period, its visible day)`` and NO row link** (ruling **R-BAL102**, which
re-ruled **R-BAL100**).  The split is re-computed from scratch by every walk,
exactly as the loan's opening and true-ups are, so it is reconciled in the
SAME loop as they are (:mod:`._corrections`) and its entry links no row: not
the loan-side shadow (its key through ``balance:X-bi-6-1b``, a row plan step
``X-bi-6-5`` deletes), not the shadow's covering movement (R-BAL100's key,
which a ``$0.00`` payment does not have -- the seam writes no movement for a
figure of nothing, and the walk still charges the installment), not the
transfer.  A key with no row has nothing to lose: no teardown door owes it a
reversal first, no detector hunts payments that "left the confirmed set" (a
key with no target reverses in the same pass), and no reader maps rows back
onto payments.  Two payments on one day in one period merge into one entry,
which is the sum the ledger holds; WHICH payment paid what is the walk's
answer (:mod:`._display`), never the ledger's.

**This module builds the TARGET and nothing else.**  The reconcile -- what is
posted, the delta, the emission -- is :mod:`._corrections`' one loop over the
anchor and split targets together, on the shared primitives in
:mod:`app.services._posting_reconcile`.

**Flask-isolated**: plain data in, plain values out; never imports
``request`` / ``session``.  Reads the chart (minting a per-loan row on first
use) but writes no posting.

    Maps the split to ``{ledger_account_id: (signed amount, posting_kind_id)}``,
    dropping any zero component so no empty per-loan ledger account is minted and
    no zero leg is written:

    * the loan's LINKED ledger (the Asset/Liability mirror the cash movement
      dumped the whole cash onto) gets ``-(interest + escrow + excess)`` tagged
      ``principal`` -- so the loan's NET across the cash leg and this
      correction is exactly ``principal`` (plan Section 1);
    * the per-loan ``loan_interest`` Expense ledger gets ``+interest``;
    * the per-loan ``loan_escrow`` Expense ledger gets ``+escrow``;
    * the per-loan ``loan_refund`` Asset ledger gets ``+excess``.

    reused after) via
    :func:`app.services.ledger_account_service.get_or_create_loan_ledger_account`,
    keyed only when their amount is non-zero.  The legs sum to zero by
    construction.  An all-principal payment (``interest == escrow == excess ==
    0``) yields an EMPTY target: the loan already nets to principal from the
    cash leg, so no correction is owed.

"""Loan-anchor correction posting: the opening and true-up TARGET legs.

The genesis balance corrections -- the once-per-loan OPENING and every user
balance TRUE-UP -- a loan books into the append-only double-entry ledger, so its
confirmed balance is fully reconstructable as ``-(sum of its linked postings)``
with no external anchor read (the foundation the read switch and Step-5 reporting
move onto).  **This module builds the TARGET and nothing else** (plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-3``, ruling **R-BAL102**): the reconcile -- what is posted, the
delta, the emission -- is :mod:`._corrections`' one loop over the anchor and the
payment-split targets together, which is what keeps a loan's three correction
kinds on one read and one write per sync.

Every anchor a loan carries posts one balanced correction (:mod:`app.services.loan_ledger` computes
its ``owed_before``)::

    loan-linked ledger   (owed_before - anchor_balance)   [opening | trueup]
    opening-equity ledger (anchor_balance - owed_before)  [opening | trueup]
                          -------------------------------
                          0

The origination anchor's ``owed_before`` is zero, so its correction is the
opening ``-original_principal`` onto the loan and ``+original_principal`` onto its
per-loan opening-equity (Equity) account.  A user-trueup's correction is
``owed_before - verified`` -- the append-only jump that reproduces the resolver's
true-up without editing any prior posting.

**Reconciled to target, keyed by (source kind, pay period, entry date).**
A correction is a derivation and has no row to key on, so the reconcile keys
each anchor's entry by its ``source_kind_id`` (opening vs. true-up), the pay
period the anchor books in, and its ``entry_date`` (the anchor date), scoped to
the loan's own chart rows.  The payment split keys the same way since ruling
**R-BAL102** (it carried the loan-side shadow's ``transaction_id`` before it,
the one derivation in the ledger with a row key).  A change to a pre-true-up
payment moves a true-up's ``owed_before``; re-running the sync re-derives the
target and posts the balancing delta, so a stale true-up self-heals.  Reads
the chart (minting the per-loan equity row on first use) but writes no posting.

**The period entered the key at plan step X-ai-r (finding N-161), and on this
side it closes a LATENT hole rather than a live one.**  The key was ``(source
kind, entry date)`` and the entry's period was resolved inside the emission
loop from the anchor date, so on a fixed calendar the target and the posted
entries always agreed and no loan figure moves (measured on a production
clone: zero deltas across every loan).  They stop agreeing when the calendar
GROWS A PERIOD around an anchor that had none.
:meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period` clamps to the last
period that OPENED on or before the anchor date when none contains it, so a
loan asserted past the end of the user's schedule files against that clamp; the
next ``extend_pay_periods`` -- or the rolling-window top-up
(``pay_period_rolling.top_up_rolling_window``, which appends through the same
function on an ordinary grid or dashboard load) -- then creates the period
that really contains it.  A period-blind key compared the two as equal, so the
delta was zero and the correction sat in the clamped period permanently, with
any later adjustment filed there too.  With the period in the key the stale
key reverses to zero and the real one posts fresh, which is the same lifecycle
every other reconcile in this ledger already gets.

*The truncating paths are NOT the mechanism, and two drafts of this note got
their reason wrong.*  Only a period APPEARING under an existing correction
reaches this.  A period being DELETED does not, but not for the reason first
written here (*"they dispose the correction with the period"*): a truncate is
REFUSED before it deletes anything, because
``pay_period_admin._period_ids_with_unbalanced_ledger`` hard-locks any
to-delete period whose per-ledger nets are non-zero -- which is what a posted
correction makes them.  ``reset_pay_periods`` is the one path that really does
wipe and re-derive, and it pairs itself with a full resync
(``resync_user_loan_postings`` / ``resync_user_account_anchor_postings``);
``truncate_pay_periods`` and ``regenerate_pay_periods`` run no resync at all,
which is only safe BECAUSE they refuse.

**Where the period comes from is the SAME on both halves, and this paragraph
used to say it was not.**  A loan anchor's period is DERIVED from its date
through :meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period`, because
``budget.loan_anchor_events`` carries no ``pay_period_id`` column at all (and
the origination anchor is SYNTHESIZED from ``LoanParams``, so it has no row to
carry one).  **The account twin makes the identical call** (ruling R-EA): a
cash assertion does store a period, and the twin deliberately does not read it,
because that column is a cache of this same derivation and a clock split made
it disagree with its own day on real data.  An earlier draft of this paragraph
read *"a cash assertion stores its own period and the account twin reads it"*;
that was true of the first build of plan step X-ai-r and was left standing when
the ruling changed, which is exactly the stale-sentence-beside-a-rewritten-one
class this arc keeps paying for.

**The rule became ONE clamp at plan step C2-d, and the fold no longer shares
it.**  It was ``loan_ledger.resolve_anchor_pay_period`` -- containment, else
the latest period ENDING before the date, else the earliest -- three branches
over two functions, and the fold's visibility rule was its second consumer.
Ruling **D5**'s one clock had already taken the fold off it (an anchor counts
from its OWN date, needing no calendar), leaving the two posting writers as the
only callers, and the 2026-08-10 ruling then named what they were really
asking: *the latest period STARTING on or before the day, else the earliest*.
The equivalence to the deleted chain, its PRECONDITION, and the proofs that
cover each half are stated once at
:meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period` rather than
repeated here and in the account twin.

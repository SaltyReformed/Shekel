"""Shared read primitives over a loan's linked-ledger postings.

The low-level queries the genesis balance readers in :mod:`._reader` and the
sync's E1a checks in :mod:`._sync` are built on:

* :func:`_has_opening_posting` -- the "is this loan configured in this scenario"
  sentinel every reader guards on before it trusts a ``$0.00`` (an unconfigured
  loan reads ``None``, not a misleading zero).
* :func:`_visible_nets` -- the one grouped ``(entry_date, net)`` load the
  per-period map prefix-sums into a running balance, and the posted side of the
  checked-projection assert (plan step E1a).
* :func:`_transfer_nets_by_date` -- the per-``(transfer, entry_date)`` nets the
  sync's lineage staleness probe compares against each settled payment's
  expected settle date and cash (step E1a).

Kept in one module so the consumers share a single definition of each rather
than re-issuing the query (the two grouped loads share one query core,
:func:`_linked_posting_nets`); scoped throughout to a loan's LINKED ledger (its
resolved per-loan liability account,
:func:`app.services.posting_service._ledger_account_for`) and the budget
scenario.

Reads only -- no writes, no commit.

    The configured-loan test the ``None`` sentinel rests on.  A loan gets
    exactly one OPENING-kind leg on its linked ledger per scenario -- the
    origination anchor correction, whose ``owed_before`` is zero and whose
    linked leg is ``-original_principal`` (always non-zero for a real loan, so
    always posted; :func:`._anchors._loan_anchor_correction_target`).  Its
    absence means the loan is not configured in this scenario (no
    :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`, or a what-if the opening was
    never posted into), which the reader reports as ``None`` -- routing the
    caller to its needs-setup path, never to a misleading ``$0``.

    Scoped to the linked ledger so the opening's OTHER leg (the
    ``+original_principal`` on the per-loan opening-equity account, same kind) is
    not what matches; scoped to the scenario so a loan opened in the baseline
    does not read as configured in a what-if it was never posted into.

"""The loan's ONE correction reconcile: anchors and payment splits, one loop.

A loan's ledger is THREE kinds of balanced correction, all projected from ONE
deterministic running-balance walk
(:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`) and reconciled here in ONE
pass (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``, ruling **R-BAL102**):

* the once-per-loan OPENING and every user balance TRUE-UP
  (:func:`._anchors.anchor_correction_targets`);
* every confirmed payment's real principal / interest / escrow / refund SPLIT
  (:func:`._payments.payment_split_targets`).

Each is a DERIVATION -- the walk re-computes it from scratch every sync -- so
each is keyed the way a derivation is keyed, ``(source kind, pay period, entry
date)`` with no row link (:data:`app.services._posting_reconcile.CorrectionKey`),
and the three share one "already posted" read
(:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.posted_correction_legs`, scoped to the
loan's own chart rows) and one delta loop
(:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.emit_correction_deltas`).  A key
present only in the target posts, only in the ledger reverses, in both adjusts
by the difference; that one shape is every lifecycle a correction has --
a payment settled, reverted, re-dated, moved to another period, re-priced,
deleted or re-pointed at another account; a true-up whose ``owed_before`` a
pre-true-up payment moved; a period boundary that grew under an anchor.

**The split was reconciled by a loop of its own, keyed by the loan-side income
shadow's ``transaction_id``, until this step -- and that key was every fence
the loan package carried.**  A row key must be defended at every door that can
lose the row: the delete door and the endpoint-move arm reversed the split
FIRST (``transfer_service._loan_posting._reverse_loan_payment_before_it_
leaves``, deleted), a detector hunted payments that had "left the confirmed
set" (``_stale_loan_payment_shadows``, deleted), and the payment-history
table read the legs back per shadow to cross-check the writer (``_reader``,
deleted; the table reads the walk).  The key R-BAL100 first chose in its
place, the loan-side covering movement, was measured to not exist for a
``$0.00`` payment the walk still charges.  A key with no row has nothing to
lose, so none of that machinery has a job.

Flushes but never commits -- the caller owns the transaction boundary.
Flask-isolated: plain data in, no ``request`` / ``session``.

    (:func:`._anchors.anchor_correction_targets`) and the settled payment
    splits (:func:`._payments.payment_split_targets`) -- reads back what is
    posted under the three correction kinds on the loan's OWN chart rows (its
    linked row and its per-loan interest / escrow / refund / opening-equity
    rows: :func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.posted_correction_legs`), and
    emits ONE balanced delta per key that differs
    (:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.emit_correction_deltas`).  One
    read and one loop for all three kinds, because interest accrues on the
    running balance the anchors reset: a pre-true-up payment change re-splits
    every later payment AND moves the true-up's ``owed_before``, and the two
    must reconcile TOGETHER off the same walk or one goes stale.

    Idempotent and self-healing: a re-run at the same state writes nothing.
    Touches ONLY the loan's own ledgers -- never the cash side (the payment's
    cash leg is the movement's own entry, immutable and correct), so a loan
    sync can never move a cash balance.  An unresolvable loan (no
    :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`: an empty walk) or an owner
    that cannot be resolved is a no-op.  Flushes but does not commit.

        loan_account_id: The loan whose corrections to reconcile.

            (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`) -- its
            ``anchor_corrections`` and ``settled_splits``, the WHOLE lists:
            the walk bounds nothing and reads no clock, so the ledger it
            projects is the same whenever this runs.

    Raises:
        PayCalendarError: The owner has no MATERIALISED pay period, so an
            anchor correction's ``NOT NULL`` ``pay_period_id`` has nothing to
            point at -- refused by

            ONE place that question is asked (developer ruling 2026-08-10).  A
            payment split carries its payment's own stored period and asks no

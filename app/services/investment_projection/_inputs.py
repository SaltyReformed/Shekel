    """ONE shadow contribution, already valued, screened and DATED.

    The boundary record this module consumes in place of a
    :class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` (plan step X-au-c2).  It
    carries exactly the four facts the readers here need, so a row's amount is
    resolved once by the loader that has a session rather than four times by
    functions that do not.

    **Non-contributing rows are ABSENT rather than zero, and that is load
    bearing rather than tidy.**  :func:`_average_transfer_contribution` divides
    by the number of DISTINCT paydays it sees, so a Cancelled contribution
    carried as ``$0.00`` would enlarge that denominator and quietly reduce the
    average -- where the ``status_contributes_to_balance`` screen it replaces
    dropped the row before the count.  The loader applies that screen and omits
    what fails it.

    **It carries the PAYDAY rather than the ``pay_period_id`` since plan step
    C2-f2c**, and that is what let the period LIST leave this module's public
    surface.  Every reader here bucketed on the id and then needed a lookup
    table to find out WHEN that period was: the YTD windows built a set of ids
    filtered by each period's ``start_date``, and the timeline built an
    id-keyed map to stamp each record with one.  So the period list was an
    argument three functions took to answer one question the loader can answer
    once, where the session is -- the same move plan step X-au-c2 made for the
    amount and the status.  It also ended a shape collision: this module is
    shared with ``/retirement``, which holds ORM rows spelling that key ``id``,
    while ``/investment`` now holds
    :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod`\\ s spelling it
    ``period_id``.

    A payday identifies a period as exactly as the id does: paydays are unique
    per owner (``uq_pay_periods_user_start``) and every batch the loader builds
    is scoped to one.

        account_id: The investment / retirement account the contribution
            landed in.  Read by the cross-account consumers, which load one

        payday: The ``start_date`` of the pay period the contribution belongs
            to -- the day every average, YTD sum and timeline record here dates
            it at.  It is a PAYDAY rather than a posting date on purpose: the
            growth engine matches a contribution to a period by that period's
            opening day.
        amount: What the row CONTRIBUTES
            (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id`): the entered
            ``actual_amount`` where a human read one off a statement, else the
            row's resolved amount.
        is_confirmed: Whether the contribution actually happened

    silently answering a different question.**  ``retirement_projection``'s

    account's deductions took from each payday
    (:meth:`AccountPayrollFeed.employee_at`) -- raise-aware,
    inflation-escalated, cadence-placed and clamped to each line's own
    calendar-year ``annual_cap`` for every payday the owner's calendar
    REACHES.  Past it the figure is the feed's HOLD, a complete year's
    average, which is none of those four things and is stated as such on
    :attr:`AccountPayrollFeed.employee_by_payday`; on a 40-year chart that is
    most of the periods.  Confirmation is date-based (past period =
    confirmed) because there is no per-period transaction record for
    deductions.

    Path 2 -- Transfer-based contributions: Per-record amounts from the priced
    shadow contributions.  Confirmation is status-based
    (:attr:`PricedContribution.is_confirmed`, resolved from
    ``status.is_settled`` at the boundary) -- factual from the transaction
    workflow.

    The growth engine handles same-date aggregation (summing amounts,
    conservative is_confirmed rule) via its lookup dict.

    **The path-1 gate is PRESENCE, not price** (an adversarial review of this
    step moved it).  It read ``models_employee`` in a first build, which is
    the priced half: a deduction fully consumed by its ``annual_cap`` across
    the whole priced window prices to ``$0.00`` on every payday while being
    genuinely configured, and so does a 12-per-year deduction on a saved
    window shorter than a month holding no ordinal-1 payday -- reachable
    because ``_month_ordinal`` counts over the owner's RHYTHM, not the
    window, and ``PERIOD_BATCH_MIN`` is 1.  That fed the engine no records
    at all, so its
    ``periodic_contribution`` fallback applied the TRANSFER AVERAGE to periods
    that should contribute nothing.  ``is_payroll_linked`` is the question the
    gate means -- *is a deduction wired to this account* -- and the class
    docstring draws exactly that distinction one field over.

    **Path 1 stopped computing anything at plan step salary:R14-b.**  It ran
    each deduction's amount off the profile's stored annual salary and then
    re-applied the calendar-year cap through a private year-state walk
    (``_deduction_contribution_records`` / ``_period_capped_total``) -- a
    second and third answer to a question the paycheck engine answers when it
    prices the paycheck.  A record is still emitted for EVERY period, a fully
    capped ``$0`` included, because a missing record is what makes the growth
    engine fall back to ``periodic_contribution``: it is the difference
    between *this paycheck contributed nothing* and *nobody said*.

    **It reads no clock and needs no period IDENTITY since plan step C2-f2c.**
    The confirmation split took ``date.today()``, so a render that straddled
    midnight could date this timeline one day and the pass around it another;
    it takes the read pass's own ``as_of`` now, which is what every other
    producer on that render already runs on.  And path 2 resolved each
    contribution's date through an id-keyed map of *periods*, which forced this
    function to know how the caller's period type spells its primary key --
    ``id`` on an ORM row, ``period_id`` on a
    :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod`.  A contribution carries
    its own payday now, so the only thing read off a period here is its
    ``start_date`` and both types serve.

    #
    # **That second term is a RESTORE, and leaving it out was a measured
    # regression this step's own adversarial review caught.**  The growth
    # engine's rule is that a dated record REPLACES the periodic fallback, and
    # ``periodic_contribution`` WAS the only carrier of
    # :func:`_average_transfer_contribution` before this step -- the line
    # below is the second, which is the whole of the restore.  Before plan step salary:R14-b
    # this timeline's domain was the owner's SAVED window, so every period
    # past it had no record and fell back to *deduction + average*; widening
    # the domain to the projection axis without carrying the average would
    # have dropped an account's whole recurring-transfer stream out of the
    # forward walk, for the entire horizon, for every account funded by BOTH
    # a deduction and transfers.  ``/retirement`` passed no dated records at
    # all, so there it was every period.
    #
    # **The asymmetry is inherited, not chosen**: the average applies only
    # PAST the saved window and not inside it, where a period without a
    # recorded transfer contributes the deduction alone.  Nobody designed
    # that -- it falls out of the fallback rule meeting the old domain -- and
    # a step ruled about what a DEDUCTION is priced from may not quietly
    # re-rule what a TRANSFER projects to.  It is filed as its own finding.
    #
    # **Reproduced EXACTLY for /investment, and NEWLY INTRODUCED for
    # /retirement**, which an adversarial review of this fix separated and a
    # first draft of this comment ran together.  ``/investment``'s old
    # timeline domain was ``reported_periods()``, which IS
    # ``calendar.saved()`` and so IS ``feed.prices()``'s domain: old and new
    # coincide on both sides of the boundary.  ``/retirement`` passed NO
    # dated records at all, so every period there -- in-window included --
    # took the fallback, and in-window periods now get the deduction alone
    # plus whatever dated transfers exist.  That is a real change to the
    # readiness verdict, its levers and the /savings Horizon band, and it is
    # NOT covered by this step's ``grid_balance_view`` measurement, which
    # reads the balance seam only.

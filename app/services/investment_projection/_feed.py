"""
Shekel Budget App -- the account payroll feed (plan steps salary:R14-b, S3-e-2).

One account's side of what the paycheck engine prices: what payroll puts into
it on a payday, and the gross of the paycheck that did it.  A VALUE built by
:func:`app.services.projection_inputs.load_payroll_feeds` and read by every
consumer; it computes no deduction of its own, which is the whole point of
the step that introduced it (ruling **R-SAL2**).

**It prices a payday ON DEMAND and carries no window** (ruling **R-SAL15**,
plan step **salary:S3-e-2**).  Until that step it was two dictionaries built
over the owner's SAVED paydays, and past the last of them it INVENTED a
figure -- the gross held at the last priced paycheck, the employee amount at
a "complete calendar year's average" -- six rules over that fold, each
measured wrong (finding **N-541**, ruling **R-SAL10**), and four false
sentences about them in this docstring (**N-542** to **N-546**).  The
remedy was never a seventh rule: the read pass's
:class:`~app.services.income_service.ProfilePaychecks` answers any payday the
owner's cadence reaches (plan step **salary:S3-d**), so the feed holds two
RESOLVERS the loader builds over it and there is no window to run out of.
The alternative -- every caller stating the periods it will read, and a
lookup that RAISES past them -- was refused because ``/retirement`` fills
one batch at the base retirement date and reads it at every retire-later
probe axis, which is the defect ``R-SAL14`` deleted one tier down.

**A resolver takes the PERIOD, not its payday** (ruling **R-SAL19**).  The
engine prices a :class:`~app.services.pay_calendar.DerivedPeriod` -- it
reads ``start_date`` and ``period_id`` -- and every caller already holds
one, so the feed's input is the engine's input.  Keying by date was an
artifact of the deleted dictionaries; keeping it would have meant
re-deriving the period from a date the caller had just peeled off it, and a
fence around the dates that are not paydays.  That revises one clause of
**R-SAL18**: an ORM ``budget.pay_periods`` row spells its key ``id`` and
cannot reach the engine, so it no longer serves
:func:`~app.services.investment_projection.build_contribution_timeline`;
no production caller hands one (all six sites pass ``DerivedPeriod``\\ s).

**Both presence facts are DERIVED from the resolvers**, one home each
(``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).  An account is payroll-linked exactly when an
active deduction on an active profile names it, which is exactly when the
loader builds it an employee resolver; it funds an employer contribution
exactly when its funding profile is known, which is exactly when it has a
gross resolver.  Plan step salary:S3-e-1 carried ``is_payroll_linked`` as a
required field because the maps could disagree with it; a resolver's
presence cannot.

It lives in its own module because the two halves of
:mod:`app.services.investment_projection` together broke pylint's 1000-line
ceiling at R14-b; the package re-exports every public name under its
original path.

class AccountPayrollFeed:
    """What ONE account's payroll puts in, priced per PERIOD by the engine.

    Two resolvers over the read pass's per-profile pricer, each ``None``
    where the fact it answers does not exist for this account.  A resolver
    is asked for a period and answers off the paycheck the engine prices for
    it -- raise-aware, inflation-escalated, cadence-placed and clamped to
    each line's own calendar-year ``annual_cap``, because the engine applied
    all four before this fold saw the line -- and the memo behind it
    (:class:`~app.services.income_service.ProfilePaychecks`) prices each
    payday once per read pass however many consumers ask.

    **Asking is the only cost, and it is paid where the asking is.**  The
    loader built this over pricers whose own database work is done at
    construction, and every ORM relationship the engine reads is loaded
    before the first walk -- ``raises`` and ``deductions`` by
    :func:`~app.services.projection_inputs._load_funding_profiles`'s
    ``subqueryload``, and ``calibration`` and each raise's ``raise_type``
    (read by ``get_raise_event`` on a raise's own month) by their own
    ``lazy="joined"``; a deduction's method and timing are read as the
    ``calc_method_id`` / ``deduction_timing_id`` columns -- so a resolver
    fired mid-walk in a pure module issues no query.  Counted at the cursor
    rather than assumed, by ``test_projection_inputs.TestLoadPayrollFeeds
    .test_a_resolver_fired_past_the_loader_issues_NO_query`` over a profile
    WITH a recurring raise inside the walked window, which fails on two lazy
    ``SELECT`` statements the moment the loader's eager-load is removed.
    The module's *no database access* contract is kept by the loader
    supplying the callables, which is the shape ruling **R-SAL15** took.

    **A period BEFORE the calendar's first payday is refused, not held.**
    The dictionaries held their EARLIEST figure backward over such a day;
    a resolver hands the period to the engine, whose ``_month_ordinal``
    raises ``PayCalendarError`` for a payday the calendar cannot place.
    Unreachable from production -- ``projection_axis`` raises its opening
    day to the opening bound, the seam walks ``reported_periods()``, and
    both current-period producers answer a saved period or ``None`` -- and
    a refusal is the right answer to a question nothing asks, where a held
    figure was a wrong one waiting for a caller.

            post-tax alike, ``$0.00`` included where a cadence skipped the
            deduction.  ``None`` when no active deduction on an active
            profile names this account.
        gross: ``period -> Decimal`` -- the gross of the paycheck the
            account's FUNDING profile was paid on that period
            (``budget.investment_params.salary_profile_id``, ruling
            **R-SAL5**).  ``None`` when no funding profile is known, which
            is the developer's 2026-09-04 ruling: an employer contribution
            whose funding job is unrecorded models NO money and the surface
            says so.  An ARCHIVED profile is unknown for this purpose too,
            and so is one that is not this owner's.

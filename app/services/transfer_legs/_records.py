Shekel Budget App -- A leg's RECORD: the one join to its side's payment.

The half of :mod:`app.services.transfer_legs` that reaches a leg's RECORD --
the payment a transfer side holds, filed under the TRANSFER by one of the
entry's two side links since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` (ruling
**R-BAL88**).  :func:`_side_records` is the ONE join's root,
:func:`_movement_link` its correlated link, :func:`_links_any` the same link
over transfer ids, and :func:`_leg_transfer_id` and :func:`_leg_is_income` say
which transfer and which side.  Every loader in this package that asks the
join lives here -- the plan half's :func:`planned_transfer_legs` and the
reconcile panel's :func:`offerable_transfer_legs` (both through
:func:`dated_leg_exists_clause`), the settled half's
:func:`transfer_movement_rows` / :func:`recorded_transfer_legs`, the posting
writer's :func:`transfer_family_movements`, the grid's
:func:`covering_movements_by_leg` / :func:`grid_transfer_leg` /
:func:`grid_transfer_legs`, the transfer service's :func:`transfer_side_leg`,
the recurrence engine's :func:`transfers_holding_records`, and every door's
"this transfer holds a payment" (:func:`transfer_holds_a_movement` /
:func:`held_transfer_entries`) -- beside :func:`movement_parent`, the join's
Python twin over one loaded movement, and :func:`parent_entries`, the list
that movement's parent loaded it into.  Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2``
moved the join off the shadows HERE, once, for every reader built on it.

**"The module docstring" in the definitions below means the PACKAGE's**

    The list the one removal act takes a movement out of after deleting it

    walks the parent's movements later in the same request -- the settle
    verbs', the entry door's re-derivation -- never meets one that is gone.
    **Asked here since leaf ``X-bi-6-4c-4``** because a transfer's payment
    has no row: since plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` its list is its
    side's collection on the TRANSFER (``Transfer.expense_movements`` /
    ``income_movements``, :func:`_side_of`), and a plan row's movement's is
    the row's ``entries``.  The act's contract is THAT collection, never a
    copy and never a union built over two of them: a list the parent did not
    load would take the movement out of itself and leave it in the parent's,
    which is the stale walk this act exists to prevent
    (``test_cc5_4a3_movement_removal``'s
    ``TestTheRemovedMovementLeavesItsParentsLoadedList``).  Both collections
    have the same shape (no delete cascade, ``passive_deletes="all"``), so
    the act's "deleted AND removed emits the ``DELETE`` alone" holds of a
    side's list as of a row's
    (``test_a_transfer_side_s_payment_hangs_off_the_transfer``).

    Reading it LOADS the collection (``lazy="select"``, which may autoflush),
    and that is the order the act needs: the list is read before the
    movement's ``DELETE`` is staged, so a lazy load cannot land the delete
    first and load a list the movement is no longer in.

        movement: A ``budget.transaction_entries`` row with its parent

"""
Shekel Budget App -- A transfer LEG: the value, its label and its identity.

The half of :mod:`app.services.transfer_legs` whose code is blind to where a
movement hangs: the :class:`TransferLeg` value every reader holds a transfer's
side as (carrying the covering movement a loader hands it as its
:attr:`~TransferLeg.record`), the one composition of a leg's LABEL
(:func:`leg_label`), the one statement of a leg's IDENTITY beside a plan row's
(:func:`cell_key`, :func:`key_order`, ruling **R-BAL87**), and the one
construction of a leg from its parent (:func:`leg_of`, :func:`_leg_on_side`).
The package docstring carries the argument.  The functions these definitions
name by bare name (:func:`planned_transfer_legs`,
:func:`recorded_transfer_legs`, :func:`covering_movements_by_leg`,
:func:`grid_transfer_legs`, :func:`movement_parent`, ``_leg_is_income``) live
in :mod:`._records`, beside the join.

    Pylint: ``too-many-public-methods`` (21/20) -- each answers a question a
    plan ROW answers (the grid's, the dashboard's, the fold's, and since
    leaf ``X-bi-6-4a`` the ledger writer's ``user_id``), derived from the

    and a leg the same question.  Fewer would put a shape branch back at
    each reader's site, the thing :attr:`tracks_purchases` says this class
    exists to stop.

    The value every plan reader folds in place of the shadow row it used to
    load, and since leaf ``X-bi-6-1`` the value the grid draws in a
    transfer's cell.  It is a PROJECTION of the parent, so the parent is the
    only thing it stores: the two derived fields say which account is looking
    and from which side, and everything else is read off the row.  The
    display-facing properties below (``name``, ``status``, ``category`` and
    their kin) are the parent's columns read through the leg, so a template
    that draws a row and a leg asks each the same question; a leg that CARRIED
    any of them would be a shadow row in memory.

        transfer: The parent :class:`~app.models.transfer.Transfer`.  Its
            ``status_id``, ``pay_period_id``, ``due_date``, ``scenario_id`` and
            ``is_deleted`` are the leg's; its amount is what
            :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_transfer_amount` answers.
        account_id: The account this leg is on -- the parent's
            ``from_account_id`` or ``to_account_id``.
        is_income: ``True`` on the to-side (money arrives), ``False`` on the
            from-side (money leaves).  The same split the transfer service
            writes as the two shadows' transaction TYPES, stated here from
            the columns that decide it rather than copied.
        record: The leg's COVERING MOVEMENT
            (:class:`~app.models.transaction_entry.TransactionEntry`,
            ``covers_settlement``) when one exists: what this side's money DID,
            written by the status seam at the settle, dated when the money
            moved and kept un-dated across a revert (ruling **R-BAL61**).
            ``None`` when the leg has none -- or when the loader did not ask:
            the fold's :func:`planned_transfer_legs` emits legs whose DATED
            movement does not exist and never loads one (ruling **R-BAL79**

            entry under a live shadow that covers no settlement -- which is

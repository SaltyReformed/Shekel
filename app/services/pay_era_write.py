Shekel Budget App -- Pay Era Writer

**The ONE place in ``app/`` that changes ``budget.pay_eras``** (plan step
``pay_calendar:C17-a``, ruling **R-PC58**).  An era is one row per *how I have
been paid since* -- the rhythm a span of paydays runs on, kept when the next
span starts on a different one -- and every batch that records a payday
reaches this table through :func:`mint_era`, :func:`retire_eras` and, for
the two changes that move the record's FIRST payday,
:func:`rephase_earliest_era` (plan steps ``pay_calendar:C18-b`` and ``C21``),
called from ``pay_period_write._apply`` and from nothing else.  The ERA RULE that
decides what a batch does here is stated in the same module, in three
parts: :func:`eras_describing` says which eras a batch leaves standing,
:func:`era_to_mint` says whether it states a new one, and
:func:`era_to_move` says where a removal of the record's first paydays
moves the earliest one (plan step ``pay_calendar:C21``).

**Why a module of its own.**  :mod:`app.services.pay_schedule_service` reads
the eras (as :class:`~app.services.pay_schedule_service.ScheduleFacts`) and
writes the schedule row; this module writes the eras.  That is the reader /
writer split ``pay_period_service`` / ``pay_period_write`` already draws for
the paydays (plan step C3-b), and it was made when the era doors took that
service past pylint's 1,000-line ceiling -- a split rather than a trim, on
the terms ledger row **PC-498** records.  The two refusals both writers ask
(the cadence bound, the cadence-convention pairing) stay in the service beside
the column bounds they state, and this module imports them.

**A caller holding a loaded ``PaySchedule`` must re-read it after any of
these doors**: ``PaySchedule.eras`` is view-only, so an insert reaches no loaded
collection, the bulk delete synchronises nothing, and a joined load does not
replace a collection the identity map already holds (measured 2026-09-11).
``pay_period_write._apply`` expires the session after it;
``pay_schedule_service.reread_schedule`` is the door for anything else.

Flask-isolated -- takes and returns plain data, never imports ``request`` /
``session``.  Flushes so callers see assigned ids, but never commits: the
route layer owns the transaction.

    in three functions: this one inserts an era, :func:`rephase_earliest_era`
    moves the earliest era's phase along its own grid in place, and
    :func:`retire_eras` deletes.  Called by ``pay_period_write.record_paydays`` when a batch

    -- a first schedule, a cadence or convention changed going forward, or a
    phase off the covering grid -- and by nothing else: a batch that continues
    an era mints nothing, which is what closed the read-path re-judging

    the write, so no door can persist what ``ck_pay_eras_cadence_range``,
    the collision floor or the month kinds' CHECKs refuse; every caller that
    takes the values from a form asks the same functions earlier so the
    refusal lands on the control the owner chose.

    **It writes the era as ONE row, and the pairing is why rather than
    tidiness.**  ``shift_id`` is legal only on a cadence longer than the
    longest run of closed days
    (:func:`~app.services.pay_schedule_service.reject_shift_on_short_cadence`),

    LEAVES BEHIND has no such hole -- the same principle
    ``pay_period_write._PaydayChange`` exists for one module over.

    **The owner's ``budget.pay_schedule`` row must already exist**
    (``fk_pay_eras_schedule``): ``pay_period_write._apply`` calls
    :func:`~app.services.pay_schedule_service.ensure_schedule_row` first, and
    no other caller exists.

            two ways before calling here: it retires every era whose first
            payday falls after the last surviving payday, and it bounds a
            minting batch at its era's first payday (``pay_period_batch``'s
            floor, since plan step ``C17-b-2``) -- so an era restated from a
            day the record already holds is REFUSED at the door rather than
            colliding on the key.  *Until then this sentence claimed the
            writer retired every era "taking effect on or after" the mint's
            day, which it never did; a rebuild from an existing era's day
            with a changed convention and every lower payday held reached
            the key as an IntegrityError.*  **That floor argument needs the
            record to stand on the earliest era's first grid step or
            above**, which is why the earlier door moves the phase down
            (:func:`rephase_earliest_era`, **R-PC105**): with only earlier
            paychecks kept below an unmoved phase, the floor IS that phase,
            and a rebuild from it with a new rhythm reached this key.  The
            removal of the first paydays moves it UP (**R-PC110**), and not
            for this argument: a record standing ABOVE the phase already
            satisfies it (the migrated era's shape).  It moves so the phase
            keeps naming the first paycheck the owner holds, and so a
            removal undoing an add leaves the era as the add found it.

    """Move the owner's EARLIEST era's phase along its own grid, its rhythm untouched.

    **The era write of the two changes that move the record's first
    payday.**  "Add earlier paychecks" records paydays below the record
    (plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-b``, ruling **R-PC105**), and the era that
    pays them is the earliest one (**R-PC66**), so its phase moves DOWN to
    the grid day of the earliest new payday (``pay_calendar.earlier_paydays``
    computes it).  "Remove earlier paychecks" retires the first paydays
    (plan step ``C21``, ruling **R-PC110**), and the phase moves UP to the
    grid day of the payday left first (``pay_calendar.opening_rephase``).
    Either way the same rhythm on the same grid, so every payday it plans
    is unchanged, and the record's first payday stands for the era's first
    grid step again.  Left below the
    phase, a regenerate keeping only earlier paychecks could restate a
    rhythm from the old phase (a second era on
    ``uq_pay_eras_user_effective_from``) or from inside the next paycheck
    (an era ``pay_calendar._derive.validate_eras`` refuses on every read);
    left under a record whose first paydays are gone, the era's "since"
    would name a paycheck the owner no longer holds.

    **An UPDATE of one row rather than a retire and a mint, and review 1 of
    C18-b is why.**  :func:`mint_era` re-asks the cadence bound and the
    cadence-convention pairing, which judges a rhythm the door never
    stated: an owner whose stored pairing a later holiday-set change made
    illegal (ledger row **N-493**) was refused by a door that states no
    rhythm -- the principle that closed **N-494** -- and refused after the
    retire's DELETE had run.  A phase move changes the row's
    ``effective_from`` and the parameter columns read against it (a clamped
    month day's ``nominal_day``, which member of a semi-monthly pair the
    anchor stands for) and nothing else.  The rhythm those columns are
    written from is the stored one the door read (``rephase.eras[0]``), so
    ``cadence_days`` is written back with the value the row already holds.

    **It moves the phase to a day on the SAME grid that leaves a sequence
    the calendar can derive, and refuses anything else** (reviews 2 and 3
    of C18-b; plan step C21).  SAME GRID: "every payday it plans is
    unchanged" holds only for a phase the era's grid already passes through
    (:func:`_on_grid`).  A phase off it -- the new first payday's DISPLACED
    cash day under ``prior`` or ``next`` rather than its nominal day --
    re-phases the grid and moves every planned payday for good, and
    :func:`reject_phase_off_grid` cannot see that for a fixed-days era; the
    same-grid question implies it for every kind, so it is not asked beside
    it.  A DERIVABLE SEQUENCE: moved down, the earliest era cannot reach a
    later era's day, pass it, or be left paying nothing (ruling
    **R-PC75**); moved UP it can do all three, and those are three of the
    states ``pay_calendar.validate_eras`` refuses.  The move is asked of
    that validator over the sequence it would leave -- the calendar's one
    statement of which sequences derive, rather than a second spelling of
    three of its clauses here -- so it refuses a move up past what the
    earliest era can pay, and admits every move down as it did.  The
    column writer holds both refusals, so neither rests on the caller.

    **Why the two refusals raise different errors.**  The grid refusal is a
    ``ValidationError`` because C18-b made it one and tests name its text.
    The sequence refusal is the validator's own ``PayCalendarError``, and it
    is unreachable from both doors: the earlier door's phase is below the
    current one, and the removal door moves the phase only onto a paycheck
    the earliest era pays (``pay_calendar.opening_rephase`` answers
    ``None`` otherwise and the door refuses first, ruling **R-PC110**).  A
    caller that reaches it built the move by hand, and the recovery page
    that error reaches is the loud answer for that.

    **What it does NOT hold, stated rather than fenced** (review 4 of C18-b).
    The UPDATE is keyed on the phase the door read, and nothing checks that
    it moved a row.  Every era writer takes the per-user lock the door read
    under, except the two ledger row **P71** records (the first-schedule
    generate route and registration).  A first-schedule generate that read
    an empty record before a first schedule committed, and retires every era
    after this door's read, would leave the UPDATE matching nothing: the
    earlier door's paydays below an unmoved phase -- the state ruling
    R-PC105 exists to prevent -- or the removal's record above one, a legal
    shape that has lost only R-PC110's "since".  The root is P71's missing
    lock, and a row count here would route around it rather than close it.

    The era rule's first half, beside its second (:func:`era_to_mint`).  An
    era pays from its FIRST PAYDAY
    (:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.first_payday_of`, its
    ``effective_from`` displaced under its own convention), so one whose
    first payday falls after the last surviving payday describes nothing the
    batch keeps -- the earliest era excepted, which runs backward; the
    batch's new paydays all fall past that day (``pay_period_batch``'s floor)
    and take their era from the mint decision.
    ``retire_eras`` is handed this set, so what is judged against and what
    survives are one set.

    **The bound is the era's first PAYDAY and not its nominal
    ``effective_from``, since plan step ``C17-b-2``** (ledger row
    **PC-510**).  An era minted on a nominal closed day under ``prior`` pays
    its first paycheck BEFORE its own ``effective_from``, so compared on the
    nominal day it described no surviving payday the moment that paycheck
    was its only one, and the next batch retired it and re-minted it a
    cadence late; under ``next`` the mirror kept an era whose only paycheck
    a truncate had removed, beside a new era paying the same day.  The
    readers place a payday in cash days (:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.era_index_at`),
    and the writer now agrees with them.

    **The EARLIEST era stands whenever any payday does, since plan step
    ``C17-c-2a``** (its adversarial review), and that is the readers' rule
    too: ruling **R-PC66** has the earliest era run BACKWARD below the
    record, so a surviving payday before its first payday is one it
    describes, and :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.era_index_at` places
    such a day in it.  The state is a migrated one: ``C17-a``'s backfill
    minted an owner's era at their opening payday less the anchor gap under
    the convention the row held THEN, and an owner who opened on a closed
    day under ``none`` and later corrected to ``next`` holds an era whose
    first payday falls two days after their first record.  Truncated to
    that opening period they stood with NO era on the first-payday test:
    the next batch retired their only era and re-minted it from the day it
    continued, and the ceiling (``pay_period_batch.reject_skipped_paycheck``)
    had no plan to read.  They continue their era now, as every other owner.

    Args:
        stored: The owner's schedule facts before the batch, or ``None``.
        surviving_paydays: The paydays the batch leaves standing.

    **The era rule's decision, and the whole of it** (plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C17-a``).  Asked by ``pay_period_write.record_paydays``
    of the facts it read for the floor, and answered HERE because whether a
    rhythm is a new era is the era's own question, beside the door that mints
    one.  A batch mints an era at its first payday when

    1. the owner holds no era -- a first schedule;
    2. the era covering that day runs on a DIFFERENT rhythm -- a cadence or a
       convention corrected going forward, which is the state ledger row
       **N-492** records the old single row could only overwrite; or
    3. the day is OFF the covering era's grid -- a phase corrected going
       forward, which ``regenerate`` expresses by a corrected first payday at
       the same cadence.

    A batch whose first payday sits on the covering era's grid at that era's
    rhythm CONTINUES it and mints nothing.  **Extend and the rolling top-up
    do not reach this question at all since plan step ``C17-c-2b``**: they
    state no rhythm, so they go through
    ``pay_period_write.continue_paydays``, which records the paydays the
    stored eras already plan and mints and retires nothing.  *Until then the
    extend door restated the LATEST era from the horizon as a stated batch,
    and an owner truncated below that era's day had it retired and re-minted
    from the day the extend continued (ledger row **PC-509**); the door that
    replaced it materialises the plan of the era COVERING the record.*

    **The grid test is the GRID's own round trip on the NOMINAL day, which
    is what *first_payday* is** (the writer's own reading of it): a day is

    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.nominal_payday` at
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.cadence_steps_to`'s answer lands back

    as ``(first_payday - effective_from).days % cadence_days == 0`` -- the
    same arithmetic under another name, and one that only a fixed-days grid
    can be asked in.  Asking the grid is what let the day-of-month kinds
    inherit the test at ``C17-d-2`` with nothing written here.  The two
    spellings agree on every integer input (Python's ``//`` and ``%`` share
    one divmod identity, brute-forced over a million pairs at the review);
    what differs is the edge of the ``date`` type itself -- a first payday
    within a cadence of ``date.min`` overflows the grid's ``timedelta`` add
    where the modulo answered ``False`` -- which no door reaches, every
    payday field being bounded at ``CALENDAR_DATE_MIN``.

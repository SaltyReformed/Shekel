"""Balance-at-T seam -- the FORWARD readers over a loan's one timeline.

Plan step **R16-a** split this module out of :mod:`._plan` when that module went
past pylint's 1000-line ceiling; plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1** emptied it of
its fold.  It held ``_split_plan``, a second replay of the loan's plan from a
SEED the settled fold had resolved, and four readers over that replay; the
seam's ONE timeline (:mod:`._loan_stream`) now carries the plan's outcomes
behind the recorded facts, so the balance is :func:`._fold.fold_from_walk` over
the timeline exactly as the past always was, and what survives here is the two
readings of the future that are not a balance at a date:

* :func:`timeline_payoff_date` -- the date the balance first reaches zero.
* :func:`required_extra` -- what must be added per month to clear it by a
  target date.
* :func:`is_retired` -- the predicate both guard on: borrowed, and now owing
  nothing.  THE one definition, shared with :mod:`._loan_figures` (it lived
  there until this step, and the two forward readers restated its arithmetic
  as ``seed <= 0``).

Both read the SAME timeline :func:`~app.services.balance_at.positions` folds,
so a loan's projected balance, its derived payoff, its required extra, its
projected interest (:mod:`._loan_interest`) and its rendered schedule cannot
disagree about what a future payment pays.  ``fold_forward``, ``_split_plan``,
``plan_interest_in_year`` and the ``PlannedInstallment`` record are DELETED:
the timeline's :class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.PaymentOutcome` is the record
for a projected payment as it is for a settled one.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes; all money is
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`.  Seam-PRIVATE -- W9910 refuses an import of it from
outside :mod:`app.services.balance_at`.

    The loan's derived payoff date: the DUE date of the FIRST projected payment
    whose running balance reaches ``<= 0`` -- the installment that pays the loan
    off (:func:`installments_payoff`).  This is a fold-to-zero, NOT the plan's
    last date: the plan runs PAST the contractual payoff (the ESTIMATED tail's
    extension, ``_plan._PAYOFF_EXTENSION_MONTHS``), so a loan paying extra
    reaches zero at an EARLIER installment (the date the engine's own
    contract-plus-extra projection reaches, ``project_forward(extra_monthly=...)``)
    and an underpaying one at a LATER installment in the extension (a real date,
    where the contract's projection forces its last date via ``is_last_month``).

    Two ``None`` cases, kept distinct from a real payoff date so the caller can
    tell "already done" from "never pays off" (both differ from "pays off on date
    D"):

    * **Already retired** (:func:`is_retired`: originated, and owing nothing at
      *as_of*): there is no FORWARD crossing to date.  The caller reads
      :attr:`~app.services.balance_at.LoanFigures.is_retired` for the paid-off
      state; this does not invent a future payoff for a loan already at zero
      (the first planned payment would otherwise look like a "payoff").  A loan
      NOT yet originated is not retired: its whole plan lies ahead and this
      dates it.
    * **Never reaches zero within the plan**: negative amortization (a payment
      below the period interest, so the balance grows), or an underpayment so
      severe the balance is still positive after the post-contractual extension.
      A MILDER underpayment is NOT here -- the extension lets it clear a few
      months past the contractual date, and this returns that later date.
      Recurrence stays indefinite; the ``None`` the retired case and this share
      is disambiguated by ``is_retired`` (retired here is False).

    The DUE date (contract time), not the visible date, is returned so the
    payoff month is the installment's own -- matching the contract's
    ``original_forward[-1].payment_date`` the payoff has always keyed on, and,
    for a normal future loan, equal to the visible date anyway (they differ only
    for an overdue-but-projected installment, which almost never clears a loan).

    The target-date calculator's answer, searched over the SAME timeline
    :func:`timeline_payoff_date` and :func:`~app.services.balance_at.positions`
    read (plan step C8f).  It answers "what must I add each month to be done by
    then" -- per ACCRUAL PERIOD since plan step R16-a, which is what the panel
    has always printed (``loan/_payoff_results.html`` renders it ``/mo``) and
    what a fortnightly payer was never given: added per RECORD it was 26
    helpings of "a month".  Where "done" is the date the BALANCE reaches zero --
    so the figure and the payoff chip beside it rest on one forward model.

    **Why it is not the schedule search it replaced.**  The retired
    ``loan_resolver.target_date_outlook`` binary-searched
    ``amortization_engine.project_forward``, which amortizes one contractual
    installment per month whether or not a payment stands behind it (finding
    B-9).  For a delinquent or drifted loan that walk retires the debt EARLIER
    than the fold does, so it could report "no extra needed" for a target the
    loan does not actually reach -- contradicting the payoff chip on the same
    screen, which folds.  Searching the fold removes the second model rather than
    relabelling its answer.

    Monotone, so a binary search is sound: every added cent is pure principal
    (:func:`~app.utils.money.apply_payment_cash` subtracts the standing interest
    and escrow first), so more extra can only move the zero-crossing earlier or
    leave it where it is.

    **Every comparison here is on the VISIBLE date, not the due date.**  The
    payoff DATE this seam reports is the clearing installment's DUE date (contract
    time, matching what the loan card has always shown -- see
    :func:`timeline_payoff_date`), but "will I be clear by X" is a question about
    when the money MOVES, and those differ for an overdue-but-still-projected
    payment: ruling D1 clamps its visible date to ``as_of + 1d`` while its due
    date stays in the past.  Comparing due dates let a target in the PAST look
    reachable -- the fold "cleared" the loan on a past due date, so the search
    happily returned a six-figure extra for a date the user cannot pay on any
    more.

    Args:
        walk: The loan's timeline as it stands (:func:`._loan_stream.loan_timeline`).
            Its projections' cash already carries the loan's STANDING
            ``extra_principal``, so the result is the amount needed ON TOP of
            the user's current plan.
        owed_from: The loan's ``origination_date``.
        as_of: The read pass's as-of -- the day the retired test values.

        ``Decimal("0.00")`` when the plan ALREADY clears the loan by
        *target_date* (including a retired loan), the searched
        per-month extra when one exists, or ``None`` for a target no extra
        reaches.  That last has two causes: no planned payment has even HAPPENED
        by then (a target in the past, or before the next installment lands), or
        -- the termination backstop below -- the search exhausted its doublings,
        which past the first guard means the split arithmetic stopped responding
        to more principal rather than that the date is genuinely out of reach.

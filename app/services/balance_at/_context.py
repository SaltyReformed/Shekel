"""
Shekel Budget App -- the balance seam's READ-PASS resolution context.

The value object that makes "one loan resolution, at one pinned as-of" a
STRUCTURAL property of a read pass rather than a discipline nobody could
enforce.

**Why this exists.**  A loan's resolved state was not a first-class value in
this architecture.  Every surface that wanted any part of a loan -- its
balance, its schedule, its payoff date, its payment feed -- re-derived the whole
thing from scratch, off a clock each producer read for itself
(``date.today()``, called in 12+ places in one ``/savings`` render).  Measured
2026-07-13 on real data: ONE ``compute_dashboard_data`` call ran the loan
resolver **eleven times for two loans** -- the balance maps, the trend window's
honest-history gate, the liability band, the loan tile, the property-equity
card, and an "ever paid off" probe each resolving independently
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/followup_redundant_loan_resolution.md``).

That was filed as waste.  It was not only waste.  Because there was no single
resolution to compare against, nothing revealed that one of those eleven -- the
``date.max`` "ever paid off" probe -- resolved through a producer that
*structurally cannot read the genesis ledger* (the confirmed view returns
``None`` for any ``as_of`` after today), and so answered from the pre-read-switch
anchor replay, which is blind to how much cash a payment actually moved.  The
ten that agreed made the eleventh invisible.  **Redundant derivation is not a
performance smell; it is where a divergence hides.**

**The contract.**  A context is built ONCE per read pass, carries the pinned
``as_of`` and baseline scenario, and lazily memoizes each loan's
:class:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.ResolvedLoan`.  Every consumer then reads
one resolution, so the loan tile's balance, the net-worth hero, the liability
band, and the debt card are identical BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by the luck of
four producers agreeing.

**Read pass, not request.**  This is deliberately NOT a request-scoped cache
(``flask.g``), for two reasons.  It would break the Flask-free service boundary
(``CLAUDE.md``), and -- the load-bearing one -- it would go STALE: the loan write
paths (``loan_recurrence_sync``, the transfer posting sync) resolve loans in the
middle of a mutation, and a request that writes and then re-renders must see the
post-write loan.  A context is a plain value the caller constructs, so a write
path simply builds a fresh one after its write.  There is no cache-invalidation
class of bug here because there is no cache -- only a memo whose lifetime is the
one read it was built for.

**Two dates, and they are not the same date.**  ``ctx.as_of`` is the resolver's
NOW: the date that decides what is confirmed and what the loan currently owes.
The ``as_of`` argument of :func:`app.services.balance_at.balance_at` is the
VALUATION date: the date to value the account AT, which may be in the past (the
genesis ledger answers) or the future (the schedule projects).  They were
conflated while "now" was an implicit ``date.today()`` inside each producer;
separating them is what lets a caller value an account at any date without the
loan silently resolving at a different one.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes.

    """One read pass's pinned as-of, scenario, and memoized derivations.

    Pylint: ``too-many-instance-attributes`` (14/7) -- suppressed because the
    fourteen ARE one read pass's state and there is no smaller cohesive object
    inside them: three PINS (``user_id`` / ``scenario`` / ``as_of``) and eleven
    MEMOS, each keyed by the thing it is a derivation of.  Bundling the memos
    behind a nested record would put an access level in front of state the
    seam fills from five different modules while creating a second object with
    no behaviour of its own.  It reached 8 at plan step C2-c, when the pay
    calendar became a pass-level derivation instead of an argument every caller
    passed by hand, 9 at X-au-c2b (the amount basis), 10 at **X-i4** (the
    cash fold), 11 at balance:X-au-d (the paycheck pricing), 12 at
    recurrence:**R16-b-2** (a rule's resolution), 13 at
    recurrence:**R7d-f-2** (a resolved recurrence's occurrence walk) and 14 at
    pay_calendar:**C18-a** (each account's books floor); plan step
    **X-i1** raises it further, because that step's remaining inputs (the contribution feed, the
    standing extra, the contractual schedule) are memos of exactly this kind.
    The count is a property of what a read pass IS rather than a threshold
    this class is drifting past.  *The figure read ``(8/7)`` and "five MEMOS"
    until X-i4, and ``(10/7)`` and "seven" until R16-b-2's adversarial review:
    each time a memo had joined without it being updated, which is the class
    of claim this file's own ``scenario_id`` docstring already warns about.*

    Frozen: the pinned inputs (``user_id`` / ``scenario`` / ``as_of``) cannot be
    reassigned mid-pass, which is the whole point -- a producer that could move
    the as-of under its consumers would reintroduce the multi-clock problem this
    object exists to kill.  The memo caches are mutable dicts held BY the frozen
    object (excluded from ``eq`` / ``repr``): derived state, not identity, so two
    contexts with the same pins are equal whether or not either has resolved a
    loan yet.

    **SIX derivations this module owns, three it stores in PUBLIC caches, and
    ONE in a PRIVATE one.**  The WALK (:meth:`loan_walk`), the CALENDAR
    (:meth:`calendar`), the AMOUNT BASIS (:meth:`amounts`), the PAYCHECK
    PRICING (:meth:`paychecks`), a rule's RESOLUTION
    (:meth:`resolved_recurrence_of`) and a resolved recurrence's OCCURRENCE
    WALK (:meth:`placements_of`) derive from leaves BELOW this module,
    which it imports outright, so all six stay private, filled by this
    module's own methods.  *The count read "two" and named only the first two
    until plan step X-i4, having missed ``amounts`` when X-au-c2b added it, and
    "three" until R16-b-2's review, having missed ``paychecks`` -- the same
    omission the attribute-count note above records, one sentence over.*  The RESOLUTION, PLAN and
    PAYOFF caches (:attr:`loans` /
    :attr:`plans` / :attr:`payoffs`) are derived in the
    ``balance_at`` seam modules ABOVE it (``_resolution`` / ``_plan`` /
    ``_positions``, which import THIS
    module); the context cannot import them back to compute them without inverting
    the dependency arrow and closing a real import cycle (finding N-25), so those
    caches are PUBLIC pass-through state the seam FILLS through
    :func:`~._memoize._memoize_once`.  Plan step D-ctx-b retired the earlier design that
    INJECTED the builder into a context method: no builder crosses into the context
    now -- the seam owns the derivation, the context owns the storage.  Plan step
    E1d-a moved the RESOLUTION under that same rule (it was a context METHOD, the
    one surface W9910 cannot see -- finding H1 of step D3's review), which is why
    ``loans`` is a cache here rather than a ``resolved_loan`` method.

    **Every account-keyed cache above is filled through ONE primitive, and that
    is where this pass BINDS the account it values** (plan step **X-i4**,
    finding **N-354**).  :func:`~._memoize._memoize_once` takes the ``account`` rather than
    a bare id and refuses one whose ``user_id`` is not this pass's, so the
    pairing the seam used to state as two independent arguments -- an account
    here, ``ctx.amounts()`` / ``ctx.as_of`` / ``ctx.calendar()`` there, agreeing
    only because every call site happened to name one ``ctx`` -- cannot be
    stated wrongly.  It is a precondition on the one constructor of per-account
    pass state, not a guard repeated at each funnel: there is no way to memoize
    a derivation against this object without going through it, and
    :meth:`loan_walk` open-coded its own store-once lines until X-i4 routed it
    here too.  What it is NOT is a second ownership gate -- see
    :class:`~app.exceptions.ForeignAccountError` for why no upstream gate can
    answer this question at all.

    Exposing THOSE THREE caches hands out no balance the fence must guard: a plan
    is payment RECORDS, a payoff is a ``date``, and a
    :class:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.ResolvedLoan` carries schedule
    detail and NO balance-at-T (its ``current_balance`` was deleted at the root by
    plan step D2a -- the reason step D3 un-fenced the memo in the first place).
    **That test is what decides which caches are public, and plan step X-i4's
    first build failed it**: it added the CASH FOLD as a fourth PUBLIC cache
    without re-reading this paragraph, and an
    :class:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold` carries
    ``seed`` and ``steps`` -- a running total, so a prefix sum over it
    reproduces the seam's own scalar exactly.  Two adversarial reviews each
    measured that bypass independently.  It is ``_cash_folds`` now, filled
    through the one crossing in
    :func:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.assembled_fold`, and the rule
    this paragraph states is the reason rather than a layering accident.

    Nor does exposing them let a consumer FORGE one.  A context is a plain value
    its caller constructs and hands to the seam; writing a fabricated bundle into
    ``loans`` is the caller lying to itself for the length of one read, not
    reaching past a boundary -- the same standing the caller already has by
    passing whatever ``as_of`` and ``scenario`` it likes.  The gate that matters
    is on the DERIVATION (every producer private to this package, W9910), not on
    the dict a pass carries its own answers in.

    Attributes:
        user_id: The owning user.  Every account a context resolves must belong
            to them, and since plan step **X-i4** that is REFUSED rather than
            trusted -- at :func:`~._memoize._memoize_once` for the account, and at
            :meth:`__post_init__` for the ``scenario`` beside it.  *This entry
            read "the caller owns that check (the loaders trust it)" until
            X-i4.*
        scenario: The baseline scenario, or ``None`` for a user with no baseline
            (the degraded state: a loan then resolves from its anchor with no
            payment feed, and the seam's cash paths cannot run at all -- see
            :func:`~._memoize.require_scenario`).
        as_of: The resolver's NOW for this pass -- the date each loan is
            RESOLVED at.  Not the date an account is VALUED at (see the module
            docstring).
        loans: The read pass's per-loan resolution cache, keyed by ``account.id``
            and FILLED by the seam's
            :func:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.resolved_loan` (this module
            never resolves a loan).  A ``None`` value is a MEMOIZED "not a
            configured loan", not an empty slot.
        plans: The read pass's per-loan forward-payment-plan cache, keyed by
            ``account.id`` and FILLED by the seam's
            :func:`~app.services.balance_at._plan.memoized_plan` (this module
            never builds a plan).
        payoffs: The read pass's per-loan derived-payoff cache, keyed by
            ``account.id`` and FILLED by the seam's
            :func:`~app.services.balance_at._positions.memoized_payoff`.
        _timelines: The pass's per-loan TIMELINE memo (plan step
            recurrence:R16-c-1), keyed by ``account.id`` and FILLED by the seam's
            :func:`~app.services.balance_at._loan_stream.loan_timeline`: the
            loan's facts walk with its forward plan replayed behind it, one
            :class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.LoanLedgerWalk` for the whole
            timeline.  PRIVATE for the reason ``_cash_folds`` is (below): a
            merged walk carries balance-at-T, and the seam module that derives
            it makes the one named crossing.
        _cash_folds: The pass's per-account cash-fold memo, keyed by
            ``account.id`` and filled by :meth:`cash_fold`.  **PRIVATE, and not
            for the reason ``_walks`` is** (that one is private because this
            module owns its derivation): an
            :class:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold`
            carries ``seed`` and ``steps``, which ARE a balance-at-T -- five
            lines of prefix sum over them reproduce
            :func:`~app.services.balance_at.cash_balance_at`'s answer exactly.
            The three PUBLIC caches beside it are public because they carry no
            such thing, which is the argument the paragraph above makes and
            which this one would have falsified.  Two adversarial reviews found
            it public in X-i4's first build and each measured the bypass: a
            consumer importing nothing private, holding only the re-exported
            :class:`BalanceContext`, read a balance the W9910 fence exists to
            make unreachable -- and W9910 sees IMPORTS, ``protected-access``
            sees underscores, so a public dataclass FIELD passed every gate.
        _calendars: The pass's pay-calendar memo, keyed by ``user_id`` and
            filled by :meth:`calendar` -- private for the reason ``_walks`` is,
            because this module owns the derivation rather than storing a
            sibling's.
        _amount_bases: The pass's amount-model memo, keyed by ``scenario_id``
            and filled by :meth:`amounts`.  Private for the same reason.
        _paycheck_pricing: The pass's PAYCHECK PRICER, keyed by ``user_id``
            and filled by :meth:`paychecks` (plan step **salary:S3-d**).

            **It replaced a public ``payroll_breakdowns`` dict, and the change
            of shape is the fix.**  That field was a raw
            ``{profile_id: {payday: PaycheckBreakdown}}`` memo that
            :func:`~app.services.projection_inputs.load_payroll_feeds` FILLED
            and that :class:`~app.services.income_service.SalaryPricing` did
            not read.  It was also OPTIONAL at that loader
            (``breakdowns=None`` meant "no memo"), which is how two of its
            four callers came to bypass it inside the step that added it.  A
            :class:`~app.services.income_service.PaycheckPricing` closes the
            second hole outright -- a consumer is handed one, so there is no
            argument to omit -- and memoizes per profile AND per payday, so
            two consumers asking overlapping spans pay for the union.

            **It closed the first at plan step salary:C12** (ledger row
            P63): :class:`~app.services.income_service.SalaryPricing` derived
            a pricer of its own until :meth:`amounts` built the basis over
            this one; the argument is at that class.

            **It exists because a paycheck is expensive and the seam asks for
            one per ACCOUNT.**  ``_contribution_inputs_for_account`` is the
            batch loader over a one-element set, so four seam entries calling
            it once per account re-ran the engine over the owner's WHOLE saved
            window each time: measured at 61 ``calculate_paycheck`` calls on a
            3-account, 10-period fixture against ~7 before ``salary:R14-b``,
            the multiplier being exactly the saved-period count.  The calendar
            memo two fields up exists for the same shape one tier cheaper.

            **PRIVATE, where its predecessor was public**, and the argument
            that made that one public has expired rather than been overruled:
            it was exposed because two callers had to be handed the dict, and
            nothing is handed a dict now -- :meth:`paychecks` is the accessor,
            exactly as :meth:`calendar` and :meth:`amounts` are for the two
            memos above.
        _recurrences: The pass's rule-resolution memo, keyed by the rule's
            SPEC and its definition's BOOKS (what it authors, where its
            accounts' books open and whether it is an envelope, not which row
            it is; :meth:`resolved_for`).  Private
            because this module owns the derivation (it imports the pure resolver, a leaf below the
            seam), and a ``None`` value is a MEMOIZED "the owner has no pay
            periods", not an empty slot.
        _placements: The pass's occurrence-walk memo, keyed by the COMPOSED
            resolved recurrence the walk is a function of (see
            :meth:`placements_of`).  Private for the reason ``_recurrences``
            is; every stored value is a tuple, and an empty one is a
            legitimate answer (a definition its destination closed before it
            ever fires), so membership rather than truthiness is the test.
        _books_opened_on: ``account_id -> governing opened_on`` (plan step
            ``pay_calendar:C18-a``): the books floor :meth:`resolved_for`
            attaches, one read per account per pass; ``None`` is a memoized
            "no opening record".  Keyed by rows, so stale after a restatement
            inside the pass -- the convention :meth:`resolved_recurrence_of`
            states for its row-keyed siblings.

        balance -- the grid's transaction load, both calendar entries, the cash

        pulse's unpaid-bill query, the emergency-fund history, the loan route's

        silently scoped to nothing (which reads exactly like an empty account)
        or an ``AttributeError`` on ``None``, which is a failure the
        application's :class:`~app.exceptions.BaselineMissingError` handler

        loud, and reaching for the nullable is a deliberate act that reads as
        one at the call site.

        **THREE callers, and the count read "exactly two, both inside the
        seam" until plan step X-au-g-2c re-took it.**  The third
        (``retirement_projection``, below) has read this since `731f6b3c`,
        2026-08-16, so the claim was false for a fortnight -- which is the
        failure this very docstring warns about two paragraphs down, committed
        in the paragraph that warns about it.  A count is a claim; re-grep it
        rather than carrying it.

        Two of the three are inside the seam, and both because a missing
        baseline is the degenerate case of their own rule rather than an error:

        * :meth:`amounts_or_none` -- the nullable form of this pass's amount
          basis, and its ONE caller is the loan bundle.  ``resolve_loan_bundle``
          read THIS accessor directly until plan step X-au-g-2c, for the same
          reason and about the same loan: a loan's payment feed is the ONE
          scenario-scoped input to its resolution; its params, anchors and rate
          history are contract facts.  With no baseline the feed is empty and
          the CONTRACT terms still resolve, which is plan step C8e's rule and
          what keeps escrow and rate editing working for a user whose baseline
          is missing (:func:`app.routes.loan._helpers._loan_terms_now`).  It
          moved one level down because ``load_loan_context`` now takes the basis
          that PRICES that feed rather than an id that only scopes it, and the
          nullability is the same nullability.
        * :func:`._confirmed_view.confirmed_view` -- the confirmed ledger view
          is scenario-scoped by construction, so with no baseline there is no
          view and the resolver falls back to its anchor replay.

        The third is OUTSIDE the seam and takes the nullable for a different
        reason, which is why it is listed apart rather than folded into the
        count: ``retirement_projection`` puts it in a MEMO KEY beside the
        owner and the as-of.  A cache key must be TOTAL over the states its
        pass can be in -- a key that raises for a no-baseline pass would turn a
        degraded read into a 500 at the memo rather than at a figure -- so the
        raise has nothing to protect there.  It scopes no query, which is the
        line the paragraph below draws.

        A third reader tests the nullable directly rather than its id:
        :func:`app.services.balance_at.liability_owed_at_dates`, the one seam
        entry with no :func:`~._memoize.require_scenario` at all.

        Anything else -- and in particular anything that SCOPES A QUERY with
        this id -- takes :attr:`scenario_id` and gets the raise, because a query
        scoped to ``NULL`` returns an empty result that reads exactly like an
        empty account.

            The baseline scenario's id, or ``None`` with no baseline.

        The seam's confirmed view, its retired predicate, its paid-in-year
        figures and -- through the timeline that appends the forward plan to
        this walk's stream (:func:`~app.services.balance_at._loan_stream

        it in a single ``/savings`` render.  The LOAD
        (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.load_loan_stream`) is the expensive
        part -- the loan's params, anchors, rate periods, escrow lines and
        settled shadows -- so re-loading per producer is exactly the redundant
        derivation the seam's resolution memo already removes.  The first call
        loads and replays; every later call in the same pass reads that same
        :class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.LoanLedgerWalk`.

        recurrence:R16-c-1, ruling **R-R91**;
        :func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.load_loan_stream`'s ``visible_by``):
        a payment from its settled day, an assertion from its own date, the
        opening always.  That is the spec's ``as_of`` -- the mark where
        recorded fact becomes projection -- stated ONCE, at the load, so a
        pass pinned to an earlier day answers what the loan looked like on
        that day (plan step ``recurrence:R7d-h``: the pass decides which
        crossing answers), and every reader that needs the bounded set reads
        THIS walk's stream (the plan's seed boundaries included,
        ``_plan._seed_boundaries``) rather than deriving the bound again.  The
        ledger's own walk
        (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`) takes no bound and
        is not this memo.  For a pass whose ``as_of`` is on or after every
        recorded fact -- every production pass -- the two are the same walk.
        So this memo is a pure function of the loan and the pass's pinned
        ``scenario`` and ``as_of``, exactly like the resolver memo above.

        **Un-FENCED at plan step D3, the same ground as the resolution memo.**
        The walk is FACTS, not a balance-at-T (plan step D-fold), and the leaf's
        own :func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger` is public and
        deliberately unfenced -- so this memo hands a consumer nothing it could
        not already obtain, and the fold that turns a walk into a balance is a
        seam-private module W9910 protects.  A consumer that wants a loan's
        balance takes :func:`app.services.balance_at.balance_at`.

        **It goes through :func:`~._memoize._memoize_once` since plan step X-i4**, where it
        open-coded the same three store-once lines before.  That was a fourth
        copy of the primitive whose own docstring says a copy is where two memos
        drift on the property they exist to guarantee -- and it was the one
        account-keyed cache on this object that the binding could not reach.

        Args:
            account: The loan account to walk.  Must belong to ``user_id``, and

        reason is SHAPE rather than safety -- a first draft of this paragraph
        claimed the key made it impossible to serve one owner's calendar to
        another, and ``frozen=True`` on a dataclass carrying ``user_id`` as a
        field already makes that unreachable (an adversarial review of C2-c
        caught the over-claim).  What the key buys is that this memo reads like
        :meth:`loan_walk`'s beside it and needs no ``None`` sentinel to tell an
        unfilled slot from a legitimately empty answer, which an owner with no
        paydays gives.

        **The derivation is imported outright**, so unlike the three
        pass-through caches beside it this one is filled here: ``pay_calendar``
        is a leaf BELOW the seam (it imports ``pay_schedule_service`` and the
        models and nothing of ``balance_at``), so the arrow stays one-way and

        calendar and its definition's books (:meth:`resolved_for`'s key), so
        an entry keyed by those inputs cannot be served for a different one.
        A first cut keyed by ``rule.id``, and the merge
        of plan step R7d-c-2 -- which has GENERATION read a rule through this
        memo -- measured the proxy's cost: ``reauthor_rule`` rewrites columns
        IN PLACE, so a rule edited and regenerated on one pass regenerated on
        its pre-edit cadence (monthly, the 5th moved to the 19th: ``updated
        5, deleted 0, created 0``).  No live route reached it only because
        every edit route builds its pass AFTER its write: a gateless
        convention maintaining the invariant the id key carried, which a key
        that is the input carries for no rule (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).  A
        re-authored rule misses on any pass, two rules stating one spec share
        one resolution (the resolver cannot tell them apart either), and a
        TRANSIENT rule (``id`` ``None``) needs no special case.  The spec is
        read ONCE, as key and input: what ``resolved_spec`` exists for.  The
        CALENDAR half is :meth:`calendar`'s memo, under the route convention.

        **The same lens one memo over, left as found.**  :attr:`loans`,
        :attr:`plans` and :attr:`payoffs` are keyed by account id and derive
        from ROWS as well as from every paying definition's spec.  Under the
        rows a generate pass CREATES they are invariant by construction
        (ruling **R-R64**: an occurrence no row answers is priced as its row
        would be, so writing that row changes nothing), which is why a pass
        may read them BEFORE it writes; the maintain pass's UPDATE arm
        re-dates rows the PLANNED tier reads and its RETIRE arm deletes them,
        so after either -- as under any other write inside one pass -- they
        are stale, guarded by the convention above since their key is rows.

        **A foreign rule never enters the memo with a VALUE, and no check here
        is what makes that so.**  The pure resolver refuses a spec paired with
        another owner's calendar -- ``RecurrenceResolutionError``, naming the
        rule -- BEFORE the store on every miss, so a hit holding a value is
        always the owner's own spec (``user_id`` is a field of the key); all a
        foreign rule can leave is the ``None`` an EMPTY calendar answers ahead
        of the ownership check, which carries nothing.  The composed door
        relies on that refusal being the rule's own and reaching a caller
        first, so a second, earlier refusal here would change which error
        names the pairing; :func:`~._memoize._memoize_once` carries its own check because

        chose** (ruling **R-R73**).  The placements are a pure function of the
        resolved value -- its cadence, its first occurrence and its COMPOSED
        closing, the destination's derived stop included -- and of this
        pass's calendar, which is :meth:`calendar`'s one memo.  So the value
        is the key: two definitions with one composed meaning share one walk
        (the walk could not tell them apart either), a re-authored rule
        resolves to a different value and misses, a definition whose loan
        moved its payoff misses with it, and an unsaved definition needs no
        special case.  A row-keyed memo would have served a pre-edit walk on
        a pass that edited and re-read, which is the defect the id key
        measured one memo over.

        **Through the saved horizon and no further**: this is
        :func:`~app.services.recurrence.occurrence_placements` with its
        default window, the walk the display readers and generation take.
        The seam's ESTIMATED loan tier walks PAST the horizon
        (``projected_occurrence_placements``, ``through=``) and is a different
        function of different inputs; it is not memoised here.

        Args:
            resolved: The recurrence's two-axis meaning, closing composed --
                what :func:`app.services.recurring_definition
                .resolved_definition` returns.  Must have been resolved
                against THIS pass's calendar, which every producer of one
                guarantees by reading :meth:`resolved_recurrence_of` or
                :meth:`resolved_for`, never the bare ``resolved_spec``.

        Returns:
            One :class:`~app.services.recurrence.OccurrencePlacement` per
            occurrence through the calendar's horizon, ascending; empty for a
            definition its composed closing admits nothing of.

        Raises:
            RecurrenceGenerationError: See
                :func:`~app.services.recurrence.occurrence_placements`; a
                raising walk is not memoised, so the refusal fires on every
                call rather than being swallowed after the first.

        The memo that makes "one pricing pass per read pass" structural, and
        plan step **X-au-c2b** put it here -- the override-map half of what plan
        step X-i1 names.  What a row's amount RESOLVES to is a derivation like
        any other on this object: the paycheck engine over the owner's whole
        pay-period set, and each destination loan's P&I, payment day and escrow
        history.  A render that asks four surfaces for a figure would otherwise
        derive all of that once per surface, which is findings **N-268** and
        **N-269** -- the dashboard pulse re-pricing rows the cash fold had just
        priced, and the transfer settle door re-querying the transfer it had
        just loaded.

        **Nothing is resolved until something asks**, so a pass that reads no
        cash figure pays nothing for holding one: both derivations behind
        :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.AmountBasis` are lazy, each answers
        ``None`` from a row's own columns before it touches them, and the
        pricer this is built over (:meth:`paychecks`) derives the calendar
        only when a paycheck is priced.

        **It pins no as-of, and since plan step X-au-g-2b there is nothing
        left for one to correct.**  The basis read ``date.today()`` for the
        loan half rather than this pass's :attr:`as_of` -- finding **N-40** --
        and the remedy was expected to be plan step **X-i2**, handing every
        memoized loader this pass's clock.  Ruling **R-IJ** closed it a tier
        DOWN instead: a loan's contractual terms resolve on the installment
        they govern, so the derivation takes no date at all and ``cash_ledger``
        makes no clock call anywhere (``test_amount_source
        .TestTheAmountModelReadsNoClock``).  X-i2 keeps every other loader.

        **The derivation is imported outright**, so like :meth:`calendar` beside
        it this memo is filled here rather than by the seam: ``cash_ledger`` is
        a leaf BELOW the seam (it imports no ``balance_at`` module at all --
        its own docstring states the arrow), so filling it here opens no cycle.

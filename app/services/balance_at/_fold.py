"""Balance-at-T seam -- the loan fold: a WALK of facts sampled into a balance.

Plan step **D-fold** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  "A loan's
balance is a fold over its event stream" (Section 3): this module owns the FOLD --
the balance half -- while the ``loan_ledger`` leaf owns the WALK it samples (the
facts).  The split is the step's whole point: *a fold is a balance; a walk is a
fact.*

The leaf's :func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger` replays a loan's
anchors and settled payments into per-payment splits and per-anchor corrections in
CONTRACT-time order -- FACTS, which both the posting writer and the seam need.
Turning those facts into "what is owed on date D" is what this module does, and it
does it the way the whole arc turns on (Section 3):

* re-key each event by the date it became VISIBLE
  (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.dated_deltas` -- on the LEAF since plan step
  E1a, because the posting writer's checked-projection assert consumes the same
  re-key and two copies of the one clock is how the fold and the ledger would
  drift), then
* prefix-sum the paydowns and read each requested date off the running total
  (:func:`sample_cumulative`) -- ``0.00`` for a date before any event, the honest
  fold of an empty prefix.

**Why the fold is in the seam and the walk is not.**  Because it lives here, a
consumer that legitimately holds a :class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.LoanLedgerWalk`
(the writer, the read pass) cannot reach a balance from a public leaf name -- the
only code that turns a walk into money is seam-private.  That is what lets the walk
shed its fence entry (a walk one call from a balance had to be fenced; a walk that is
not, does not).  This is the balance-side twin of the forward fold
(:func:`app.services.balance_at._plan_fold.fold_forward`), which has lived seam-private
since step C6a; the two share the one date-sampling core :func:`sample_cumulative`,
so the past and the future cannot drift on how a running balance is read at a date.

**TOTAL and clock-free.**  :func:`fold_loan_balances` refuses no date and no
account: a date before any event, or an account with no
:class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`, folds to ``0.00``; a future date
answers (holding the last recorded balance flat) rather than raising.  That totality
is the property that deletes the posting readers' partiality -- there is nothing to
compose it with, so no seed / flag / splice / fallback can disagree with it.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes; all money is
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`.

    It scans the SAME collapsed running balance :func:`sample_cumulative` bisects

    :func:`fold_from_walk` rounds a sampled one, so the date this returns is a
    date the fold itself reports ``<= 0.00`` on -- the crossing and the balance
    beside it cannot disagree.

    **A loan that closed, was trued back UP, and closed again has TWO crossings,
    and this returns the LATER** (developer, 2026-09-03).  The alternative reads
    a loan's whole reopened span as already finished: with a payoff on
    2026-09-01, a ``$1,200.00`` true-up on 2026-10-15 and a ``$1,200.00`` payment
    clearing it on 2026-11-20, taking the FIRST crossing stops the loan's
    recurrence on 2026-09-01, so the payment that actually settled in November
    has no projected row behind it and generation silently under-produces across
    the span.  The later crossing is also what "the day it last became closed"
    means literally.

    **The zero before a loan exists is not a closed loan.**  A date before any
    recorded fact folds to ``0.00`` -- the empty prefix's honest answer
    (:func:`fold_from_walk`) -- but the loan had not been borrowed yet, so the
    scan treats the state before the first event as OPEN.  Two consequences: a
    loan with no fact by *as_of* answers ``None``, and one whose FIRST visible
    balance is already ``<= 0`` closes on that first date rather than answering
    "never".  The second is reachable through a ``$0.00`` true-up dated ON the
    origination date -- ``anchor_service`` admits ``anchor_date >=
    origination_date``, and the two facts then collapse onto one boundary.  It
    is NOT reachable through a zero OPENING anchor, which is synthesized from

    The fold's read side, and the reference the optimized readers are graded

    (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`), sampled at every requested
    date (:func:`fold_from_walk`) -- so N dates cost one walk, not N.  A read pass
    that would fold the same loan more than once memoizes the walk on its context
    and calls :func:`fold_from_walk` directly; this entry is the standalone form for
    a caller (B2's oracle) that holds no context.

    **It reads the loan's SOURCE rows and never the postings table.**  That is the
    whole point: the posted ledger is a PROJECTION of this fold, so an answer
    derived independently of it is what can prove the projection faithful.  Where
    the two disagree, the ledger is a stale cache -- a detectable, repairable
    inconsistency -- rather than the outage a missing posting is today.

    **TOTAL over every DATE and every ACCOUNT.**  There is no date it refuses and
    no account it refuses: asked about a date before any event -- or about an
    account with no :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams` at all -- it
    returns ``0.00``, the correct fold of an empty prefix; asked about a future
    date it answers rather than raising.  This is the property the whole arc turns
    on (plan Section 3): the posting readers' partiality (``None`` for an unopened
    ledger, a RAISE for a future date) is what forces every caller to compose them
    with a projection, a seed, a flag or a fallback, and every composition is a new
    producer that can disagree with the others.  A total function has nothing to
    compose with.  A caller that must distinguish "owed nothing" from "no loan"
    asks the FACT (``origination_date``), never this function's zero.

    That totality is genuine since step C2: an event's visible-on date is its own
    date (an anchor) or its settled date (a payment), neither of which needs the
    owner's calendar, so the fold no longer has a "loan has facts but its owner has
    no pay periods" state to raise on.  It answers from the loan's facts alone.

    **ACTUAL events only.**  It folds what is RECORDED -- the loan's anchors and
    its settled payments -- so it answers the past.  PLANNED payments (the future)
    are the seam's forward fold (:func:`app.services.balance_at._plan_fold.fold_forward`
    over the loan's plan); asked about a future date this holds the last recorded
    balance flat, which is honest for what it knows but is NOT the projection the
    seam shows.  Grade it on the past.

    **N-11 (a raw transaction typed onto a loan) is closed by construction (BG,
    ruling R-E), not a live gap.**  A raw settled transaction typed directly onto a
    loan account would post onto the loan's linked ledger where the sum-of-postings
    readers count it, while the fold -- whose payment set is transfer-linked shadows
    only (:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.settled_income_shadows`) -- would not
    see it, so the two would disagree by that transaction's amount ($300.00
    measured).  Ruling R-E FORBIDS that write at every source (the two
    transaction-create routes, the recurrence-template form, and the salary-profile
    picker each refuse an amortizing account -- BG, ``dba91dc0``), so no such row
    can enter the fold's domain; B2 both demonstrates the divergence on a forced
    row and asserts the sources refuse it.  Do NOT read a disagreement in that
    shape as a stale cache to be repaired.

    Reads only -- no writes, no commit.  This standalone entry (walk + sample in
    one call) is B2's parallel-run oracle subject; it DELEGATES to
    :func:`fold_from_walk`, which is the code the seam's AMORTIZING dispatch now
    runs in production (over the read pass's memoized walk, step C3b) -- so the
    oracle grades the exact sampling the user's balance is answered by, not a copy
    of it.

"""Balance-at-T seam -- a loan's CONFIRMED view, folded from the walk.

Plan steps **E1c** (built) and **E1d-b** (cut over)
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  A loan's confirmed state --
the balance it owes today and the CONFIRMED schedule rows the amortization table
and the forward projection seed from -- used to have one producer,
``loan_payment_service.confirmed_loan_view``, which read it out of the POSTED
ledger (a cache of journal entries).  This module builds the SAME
:class:`~app.services.loan_resolver.ConfirmedLedgerView` from the event WALK
instead -- the balance from the fold (:func:`._fold.fold_from_walk`) and the
history rows re-derived from the walk's per-payment splits and per-anchor
corrections -- so the confirmed view no longer depends on the posting cache
being warm.  Step E1d-b made it the production seed and DELETED the posting
view; step E1e deleted the two posting balance readers behind it.

**Why this completes the read switch (plan Section 3).**  The seam's balance
SCALAR, per-period MAP, and LIABILITY band already fold the walk (steps C3b1/C3b3);
the confirmed VIEW that seeds the RESOLVER was the last surface still reading the
partial posting readers.  Building it from the walk is what lets those readers
come off the production path: ``confirmed_loan_history_rows`` was DELETED with
the view that composed it, and ``confirmed_loan_balance_at`` /
``confirmed_loan_balance_map`` -- left with no caller in ``app/`` at all -- were
DELETED at plan step E1e, their oracle window moving to the test suite.  It also
lets a loan with a cold posting cache
seed its schedule from source facts rather than fall back to the money-blind
anchor replay (finding B-12).

**Byte-equal to the reader it replaced, proven before the cutover.**  The row
builder reproduced the posting reader's ``confirmed_loan_history_rows``
exactly: each row's ``principal`` / ``interest`` equal the posted linked /
interest nets (the checked-projection invariant plan step E1a asserts at write
time), and its ``remaining_balance`` is the SAME contract-order running sum over
the SAME visible event set the reader walked.  Step E1c's oracle parallel-ran
the two on EVERY DAY of nine shapes and they agreed byte for byte; step E1d-b
retired that oracle with its counterparty and re-anchored every shape on
HAND-COMPUTED values instead (``tests/test_services/test_confirmed_view.py``),
so the rows are pinned by arithmetic rather than by a second implementation.

**Two DELIBERATE divergences from the reader, both documented not hidden.**  The
fold is TOTAL, so it answers where the partial reader returned ``None`` -- a
BROKEN loan (originated, no opening posting: a cold cache or a what-if never
posted into) folds from SOURCE facts (finding B-12, the same repairable-cache
decision the scalar and map took at steps C3b1 / C3b3) -- and it is blind to a
raw transaction typed onto a loan account (finding N-11, forbidden at source by
step BG) where the posting reader was not.  Both are pinned in the test file.

    ACTUAL economics off the walk's split:

    * ``principal`` / ``interest`` -- the split's real principal and accrued
      interest, which the posting writer books verbatim onto the ledger, so they
      equal the posted nets (plan step E1a's checked-projection invariant).
    * ``remaining_balance`` -- the genesis running balance owed AFTER this payment,
      accumulated in CONTRACT order over ONLY the events visible by *as_of*: an
      anchor moves the balance by ``owed_before - anchor_balance`` (the exact linked
      net its posted correction carries), a payment by ``+principal``, and the row

      NOT the fold sampled at the payment's visible date: a payment settled in the
      future (not yet visible) but due EARLIER must not reduce a visible row's
      balance.
    * ``payment`` / ``extra_payment`` -- the actual P&I split against the governing
      period's contractual ``period_pi`` under the schedule-row invariant
      ``principal + interest == payment + extra_payment``.
    * ``month`` / ``payment_date`` -- numbered and dated at the installment the
      payment satisfies (the split's ``due_date``, the walk's own ordering key), so
      a late-settled payment is dated at the installment it paid, never the next.
    * ``interest_rate`` -- the split's governing period ``annual_rate`` (the SAME
      period its ``interest`` accrued at, carried on the split -- plan step E1c).

    Event ORDER mirrors the write walk exactly: payments by DUE date, anchors by

    The loan resolver's confirmed SEED (plan step E1d-b): the confirmed balance
    owed as of ``ctx.as_of`` -- the FOLD of the loan's recorded events -- bundled
    with the ledger-derived confirmed schedule rows, or ``None`` to fall back to
    the resolver's anchor replay.  The seam's whole-loan read
    (:func:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.resolve_loan_bundle`) threads it
    into every resolution, and the loan-detail route's what-if composers read it
    for the same seed, so the loan card, the amortization table's confirmed rows,
    the band chart, and the payoff / refinance calculators cannot disagree about
    what has actually been paid.

    Derived on demand, NOT memoized, and that is deliberate: the expensive part
    -- the walk -- IS memoized on the pass
    (:meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.loan_walk`), so a second call
    in one pass costs no query at all, only a prefix-sum and a row re-accumulation
    over facts already in memory.  Caching the result would put a balance-bearing
    value on the publicly re-exported context, which is the one thing its plan /
    payoff caches are careful not to do.

    Returns ``None`` on four guards, so a caller's fallback to the anchor replay
    is exactly the pre-switch behaviour:

    * ``ctx.scenario_id_or_none`` is ``None`` (no baseline scenario to scope the
      walk to -- one of the seam's two degenerate-case readers of the nullable,
      ruling R-BX);
    * ``ctx.as_of`` is after today (a future date is a forward projection, out of
      the confirmed view's domain -- the resolver projects it);
    * *account* is not a configured loan (its walk carries no opening fact, so it
      has no :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`);
    * ``ctx.as_of`` PRECEDES the loan's ``origination_date`` -- nothing has happened
      to it yet, and the fold's honest ``0.00`` for an empty prefix must not seed the
      forward projection (outage B-1: it collapsed a 360-row schedule to zero rows
      and held $200,000 flat forever).  The same rule is stated in full on
      :func:`app.services.balance_at.positions`'s not-yet-originated branch.

    **One case the retired posting view returned ``None`` for, this does NOT: a
    BROKEN loan** (originated, no OPENING posting -- a cold cache or a what-if
    never posted into).  The fold answers from the loan's SOURCE facts, so the
    real confirmed view survives a cache the posting reader could not read
    (finding B-12) -- the same repairable-cache decision the scalar and map took
    at steps C3b1 / C3b3.

    Args:
        account: The loan account whose confirmed view to build.  The caller owns
            the ownership check (the loaders trust it).

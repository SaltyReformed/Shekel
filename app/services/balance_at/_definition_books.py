"""WHERE A RECURRING DEFINITION'S BOOKS OPEN -- the floor its occurrences start above.

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``, rulings **R-PC85** and **R-PC86**
(developer, 2026-09-22).  A recurring definition's occurrences run from the
LATER of its own first occurrence and the day after the books open on every
account it moves money in -- the opening end's mirror of how its closing
already composes the owner's end date with a loan's payoff.  The rule says
when it fires; the ACCOUNT says where the app keeps books, and money on or
before an account's opening day is already inside its opening equity (ruling
**balance:R-HG**).  This module answers the account half:
:func:`definition_books_opened_on`, read by
:meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.resolved_for` and attached to
the resolved value the recurrence walk then bounds by
(``recurrence._placement._lands_inside_the_books``) -- beside the one fact
about the DEFINITION that walk also asks, whether it is an envelope, whose
row the books compare on its paycheck's last day rather than its due day
(ruling **R-PC89**).  :func:`definition_books` reads both as ONE value, so
the pass's memo keys on the pair and cannot serve an envelope's walk to a
bill stating the same cadence over the same accounts.

**Why this is a fact about ACCOUNTS and never about the rule.**  A rule's
``starts_on`` is its first occurrence (ruling **R-R16**) -- the rhythm's
anchor and, for a rule that begins in the future, its start -- and it is
authored.  "Not before my account's books" is stored once, in
``budget.account_openings``, and it is RESTATED: on the production clone this
was measured on, the Van Loan's opening moved 2026-05-21 -> 2026-04-22.  A
copy of it on the rule would be a second home needing a reconciler
(``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14); reading it here, on every pass, is what makes the
bound follow a restatement with nothing to keep in step.

**Why it is a module of its own**: ``_context.py`` stands within a hundred
lines of pylint's 1,000-line ceiling, and the two questions below -- which
accounts a definition moves money in, and where the latest of their books
opens -- are this step's, not the pass's.  The pass keeps the MEMO (one read
per account per pass) and the one composition; this keeps the reading.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data in,
plain values out; no Flask symbol, no writes, no clock.

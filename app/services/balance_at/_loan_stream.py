"""Balance-at-T seam -- a loan's ONE timeline: its recorded facts, then its plan.

Plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1** (rulings **R-R90** and **R-R72**).  A loan's
balance is a fold over its event stream, and until this step the seam folded
that stream TWICE: the settled walk from ``0.00`` over the recorded facts
(:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`), and the forward plan from
a SEED -- the walk's balance at the read day -- over the projected rows and
estimated occurrences (``_plan_fold._split_plan``).  Two event lists, two seeds,
two output types, and a set-subtraction (``seed_slots``) keeping the two charge
calendars apart.  Each of those was one value with two homes.

This module builds the ONE stream: the recorded facts the pass has SEEN --
:meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.loan_walk` replays the facts
visible by the pass's ``as_of``, the spec's mark where recorded fact becomes
projection -- then the plan's payments as PROJECTIONS behind them
(:attr:`~app.services.loan_ledger.LoanEventStream.projections`), replayed once
by the leaf's :func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.replay_loan_stream` from the one
seed every loan has, its origination assertion.  The result is a
:class:`~app.services.loan_ledger.LoanLedgerWalk` holding the loan's WHOLE
timeline: :func:`~app.services.balance_at._fold.fold_from_walk` values any date
off it, past or future, by one prefix-sum over one dated-delta list; the payoff
is the first projected outcome whose balance reaches zero; the tax figure is
one sum over one list of outcomes; the loan page reads the same outcomes.

**What the merge changes, and what it does not.**  A projected payment is never
placed before a recorded fact (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.projection_boundary`),
so the fact prefix of this walk is the pass's facts walk exactly -- and, for a
pass whose ``as_of`` is on or after every recorded fact (every production
pass), :func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`'s output exactly, so
the posted ledger -- which replays the facts and nothing else -- agrees with
every screen on every settled payment by construction.  **ONE calendar charges
both** since plan step recurrence:R16-c-2 (ruling **R-R100**): every
contractual installment from origination, through the stream's last event
(:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.with_contract_charges`).  The contract
terms are the SAME object in both -- the facts walk carries the calendar it
was charged on, the plan reads it off that walk rather than building its own
(:func:`~._plan.loan_plan`), and this module charges the timeline from it --
so the facts' charges are a prefix of the timeline's by construction (one
calendar, one pure function, a later last event), and the plan's own charge
list and the ``seed_slots`` partition that kept it apart from the facts' are
deleted.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes; all money is
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`.  Seam-PRIVATE -- W9910 refuses an import of it from
outside :mod:`app.services.balance_at`.

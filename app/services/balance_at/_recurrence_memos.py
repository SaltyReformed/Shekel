"""
Shekel Budget App -- the read pass's RECURRENCE memos, inherited by the context.

:class:`RecurrenceMemosMixin` holds the three methods that resolve and walk a
recurrence once per read pass, and
:class:`~app.services.balance_at._context.BalanceContext` inherits them, so every
caller still asks ``ctx.placements_of(...)``.  They moved here verbatim when
``_context.py`` reached the 1,000-line ceiling, which coding-standards ruling
**balance:R-IR** answers with a split, never an exemption; ruling **R-BAL146**
chose this shape.

**A mixin, not a second object**, because the methods memoize into the PASS's
own fields and derive from its calendar: a separate holder would need the pass
handed to it on every call.  **This module is W9909-scoped on its own entry**
(``tools/pylint/shekel_checkers/_fence_rulings.py``): the fence matches a
module by its name or a package prefix, and a sibling of ``_context`` is
neither, so a public method born here would otherwise reach every route holder
of the context unclassified.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes.

        The memo that collapses a read pass's N resolutions of one rule to
        one.  Plan step **R16-b-2** put it here: the composed door
        (``recurring_definition.resolved_definition``) resolves a definition's
        rule to narrow it by the loan's derived stop, and that stop is the
        forward plan's zero crossing, which since R16-b-2 walks the SAME rule
        under its authored closing to sum the definition's occurrences -- so
        one page reading one loan payment resolved its rule twice on one pass
        (plan ledger row **N-511**'s shape; rule 14's ONE WALK forbids it).
        Both readers take the resolution (books attached) from here and each
        applies its own closing to the value.

        **A memo on the PASS, not a cache**, for the reason :meth:`calendar`
        gives, and filled here because ``app.services.recurrence`` is a leaf
        below the seam.

        **Keyed by what the rule SAYS, not by which row it is.**  The
        resolution is a function of the rule's authored columns, the pass's
        calendar and its definition's books (:meth:`resolved_for`'s key), so
        an entry keyed by those inputs cannot be served for a different one.
        A first cut keyed by ``rule.id``, and the merge
        of plan step R7d-c-2 -- which has GENERATION read a rule through this
        memo -- measured the proxy's cost: ``reauthor_rule`` rewrites columns
        IN PLACE, so a rule edited and regenerated on one pass regenerated on
        its pre-edit cadence (monthly, the 5th moved to the 19th: ``updated
        5, deleted 0, created 0``).  No live route reached it only because
        every edit route builds its pass AFTER its write: a gateless
        convention maintaining the invariant the id key carried, which a key
        that is the input carries for no rule (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 14).  A
        re-authored rule misses on any pass, two rules stating one spec share
        one resolution (the resolver cannot tell them apart either), and a
        TRANSIENT rule (``id`` ``None``) needs no special case.  The spec is
        read ONCE, as key and input: what ``resolved_spec`` exists for.  The
        CALENDAR half is :meth:`calendar`'s memo, under the route convention.

        **The same lens one memo over, left as found.**  :attr:`loans`,
        :attr:`plans` and :attr:`payoffs` are keyed by account id and derive
        from ROWS as well as from every paying definition's spec.  Under the
        rows a generate pass CREATES they are invariant by construction
        (ruling **R-R64**: an occurrence no row answers is priced as its row
        would be, so writing that row changes nothing), which is why a pass
        may read them BEFORE it writes; the maintain pass's UPDATE arm
        re-dates rows the PLANNED tier reads and its RETIRE arm deletes them,
        so after either -- as under any other write inside one pass -- they
        are stale, guarded by the convention above since their key is rows.

        **A foreign rule never enters the memo with a VALUE, and no check here
        is what makes that so.**  The pure resolver refuses a spec paired with
        another owner's calendar -- ``RecurrenceResolutionError``, naming the
        rule -- BEFORE the store on every miss, so a hit holding a value is
        always the owner's own spec (``user_id`` is a field of the key); all a
        foreign rule can leave is the ``None`` an EMPTY calendar answers ahead
        of the ownership check, which carries nothing.  The composed door
        relies on that refusal being the rule's own and reaching a caller
        first, so a second, earlier refusal here would change which error
        names the pairing; :func:`~._memoize._memoize_once` carries its own check because
        the derivations it stores do not refuse for themselves.

        **Its books floor is its OWNER's accounts'** (plan step
        ``pay_calendar:C18-a``): :meth:`resolved_for` over the rule's
        template; a payroll line's rule has none and gets no floor.

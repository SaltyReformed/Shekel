"""Balance-at-T seam -- BUILDING a loan's forward plan: records, not schedule rows.

Plan step **C6a** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  A loan's
future balance is a fold over what it will be CHARGED and what it will PAY;
this module builds that model (:class:`LoanForwardPlan`) and :mod:`._plan_fold`
folds it.

**The two halves are separate values, and plan step R16-a is why.**  A loan
charges interest because time passed and impounds escrow because a month began;
a payment moves cash on whatever date its recurring definition names.  While the
charge rode ON the payment record, the payment COUNT was the clock -- measured on
a production clone, 30 payments of ``$531.94`` fourteen days apart charged the
same ``$1,096.34`` as 30 a month apart, split for split, so a loan paid twice as
fast modelled the identical interest.  :class:`AccrualCharge` is the time half
and :class:`PlannedPayment` the cash half, and neither can be derived from the
other.

The PAYMENTS come in two tiers:

* **PLANNED** -- the loan's PROJECTED transfers, each as the leg of its parent
  row INTO the loan (:func:`app.services.loan_loaders.projected_income_legs`;
  plan step **balance:X-bi-6a**, ruling **R-BAL13** -- a projected payment is
  derived from its parent transfer, not read off a shadow row), each at what
  the amount model resolves the PARENT to
  (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.planned_leg_contribution`, the SAME cash the
  checking side shows leaving).  A record is the evidence a payment will
  happen; where the record's due date has already passed but it has not
  settled, it is clamped forward to ``as_of + 1d`` -- "a plan cannot have
  already happened" (ruling D1).
* **ESTIMATED** -- **what a generate pass over the owner's whole schedule
  would write, priced as those rows would be priced** (plan step **R16-b-2**).
  EVERY active recurring transfer into the loan is walked on its OWN cadence
  under its AUTHORED closing (:func:`._plan_definitions.estimated_from_definitions`); each
  occurrence the schedule can place that NO ROW IN ANY STATE answers is dated
  as generation would date its row and priced through the amount model's own
  arm (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.definition_cash`).  A loan with no
  definition at all is priced by its CONTRACT, one installment per future
  installment no record covers (:func:`_estimated_from_contract`), dated and rated by
  the contractual schedule
  (:func:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.contractual_schedule_from_origination`)
  -- its installment DATE and P&I, never its ``remaining_balance``, which this
  re-folds.

**Why every definition, and why on its own cadence** (rulings **R-R35**,
**R-R36**, **R-R37**, **R-R65**; findings **D47**, **D48**).  Until R16-b-2
this tier synthesized one slot per CONTRACTUAL month and priced every slot
from ONE definition picked by lowest id, so it modelled the contract's rhythm
carrying one definition's price: re-authoring the Van's payment to every
paycheck left the estimate byte-identical at 12 installments a year against
the rule's 26.07, and re-pointing a ``$500.00`` every-paycheck sweep at the
Mortgage priced every uncovered installment at ``$500.00`` against a
``$616.99`` escrow, read the payoff ``None`` and grew the balance to
``$1,059,869.99`` by 2053 -- where summing each definition's occurrences
answered ``2034-10-01``.  The other two tiers (the settled fold and the
PLANNED tier) already summed every transfer into the loan with no template
filter; this was the one outlier, and four tie-break remedies were refused
to delete the question rather than answer it (R-R35).

**Why the fold prices an occurrence NO ROW answers, past or future** (ruling
**R-R64**, finding **D46**).  Generation has been exhaustive over the
schedule since R17, so "no row at all" for an occurrence the schedule places
means "not generated yet" -- and a cancelled or deleted row still ANSWERS
its occurrence (the owner un-planned it).  Before R-R64 an occurrence dated
before ``as_of`` that no row answered when a pass read the loan was priced by
neither tier (B-9's "the past is the ACTUAL fold's"), so the payoff read one
installment late and generation bounded by that payoff wrote one installment
past the loan's life: ``$1,200`` at 3% over three months, ``as_of``
2026-03-01, the 02-15 row wiped by the reset door -- 4 rows against 3.
**Bounded by the SCHEDULE**, which the ruling's first statement did not say
and which is what makes it correct on live data: an occurrence the owner's
pay calendar cannot place (before its first payday under ``CONTAINING_DATE``)
is neither generated nor estimated.  The Mortgage's rule starts 2019-01-01
against a schedule opening 2026-03-26; priced literally, its 87 pre-schedule
occurrences would pay ``$166,252.65`` the day after ``as_of``.

**Why the DEFINITION and not the contract** (plan step **R7d-a**).  This tier
priced every uncovered slot at the contract's P&I, whatever the loan's own
recurring payment said it would pay, so "what will this loan be paid in month
M" had two answers and which one the fold used depended on whether the row had
been WRITTEN yet.  R16-b-2 finished that argument: the estimate is now the
row's own pricing function over the columns the row would carry, so the two
answers are one by construction rather than by two arms agreeing.  Two
consequences of the contract-priced tier, both measured on a production clone
with a PLANTED underpayment -- the Van Loan's definition moved to ``$300.00``
against its ``$531.94`` contractual installment, rolled back after each
probe:

* the plan SWITCHED figures at the materialized horizon, projecting a payoff of
  ``2030-02-22`` with rows to 2028-07 and ``2030-04-22`` with rows to 2029-01 --
  the owner's figure inside the horizon and the servicer's past it;
* and the payoff moved with materialization.  ``regenerate_pay_periods`` deletes
  the rebuildable tail of pay periods (``budget.transfers.pay_period_id``
  CASCADEs) and repopulates, and the payoff read AT that moment was
  ``2029-02-22`` against ``2030-02-22`` before and after -- twelve months early,
  on the very figure the recurrence's closing bound is derived from.

One rule for both tiers closes both: the loan is modelled as paying what the
owner has told it to pay, resolved AS OF each installment, materialised or not.
**Unplanted, on the developer's own data, it moves ``$0.00``** -- 776 forward
figures byte-identical -- and the reason is worth stating, because it is a
precondition rather than a general result: both templates state exactly P&I plus
an escrow that is CONSTANT across the whole horizon, so ``stated price - escrow``
equals the contractual P&I at every installment.  A future-dated escrow version
would break that equality, and there is none to measure against.

**Why this replaces the schedule walk (finding B-9).**  The retired forward walk
(``account_projection.forward_balance_at_date``, deleted at step C6b) amortized
one contractual installment per month whether or not any payment was recorded, so
an overdue installment nobody paid still paid the loan down.  Here an installment
pays the loan down only where a payment RECORD stands behind it (PLANNED) or where
the owner's definitions say the loan will be paid (ESTIMATED); an occurrence the
owner UN-PLANNED -- a cancelled or deleted row -- pays nothing, and since R16-b-2
its month is CHARGED anyway (rulings **R-R37**, **R-R71**; finding **D53**), so
a delinquent balance grows in the projection rather than holding flat.  What
B-9 keeps is the narrower claim: the fold never invents a payment nothing
stands behind -- and never one the write door would refuse: an occurrence at or
before the loan's origination (ruling R-C, the door's
:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.precedes_origination`) is dropped with every
other payment at or before the loan's latest assertion, of which the
origination is the first (:func:`loan_plan`, ruling **R-R72**), because
generation cannot write it and the fold would erase it if it could.

**The CHARGE calendar is the contract's, and it is not built here** (plan
step **R16-b-2**, rulings **R-R68** and **R-R71**, findings **D53** and
**D54**; since plan step **recurrence:R16-c-2**, rulings **R-R72**, **R-R89**
and **R-R100**).  A loan is charged on EVERY contractual installment from
origination, whether or not a payment lands in it, in the settled walk and the
forward plan alike: the plan carries the loan's contract terms
(:attr:`LoanForwardPlan.calendar`) and the leaf charges the whole timeline
through its last event (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.with_contract_charges`),
so no month can be charged by two calendars (D54's double charge) or by none
(D53's past half: a skipped month the posted ledger never charged).  Until
R16-c-2 this module built a second calendar -- the installments after the
loan's latest assertion, minus the ``(year, month)`` slots the settled walk had
charged -- and that set of slots was the partition the step deleted.  Deriving
the calendar from the payments was exact only while every month held one: a
quarterly definition would have charged 40 months where the contract owes 120.
**The loan's latest assertion bounds the PAYMENTS** (ruling **R-R72**): a
planned row or an estimated occurrence whose installment is due at or before it
is not folded, because the settled walk will not fold it either once it
settles -- it walks the payment and then resets at the anchor
(:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.replay_loan_events`), so its cash never
reaches the post-assertion balance; an adversarial review of R16-b-2 measured
the plan folding projected rows a true-up had already subsumed, money that
vanished the day they settled.  The same assertion clears every charge
standing before it (R-R72 part (2)), which is what lets the calendar run from
origination: a loan configured mid-life has its pre-tracking months charged
and cleared by the balance stated at setup, which plan step ``R20`` records as
the assertion it is (a ``tracking_start``, finding **REC-519**).  A loan
configured before R20 without one reads as unpaid since origination -- which
is what its records say, and not a bound this module guesses around.

**Why in the seam, not the ``loan_ledger`` leaf.**  The plan composes the loan's
projected records, its live D3 cash, and the resolver's contractual schedule --
all above the pure leaf -- so it is a SEAM responsibility, exactly as
:func:`app.services.balance_at.positions` composes the past fold with the forward
projection.  What :mod:`._plan_fold` does NOT own is the arithmetic: since plan
step X-au-g-2c-3b-2 it maps this model onto
:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.replay_loan_events`, the ONE replay the settled
walk runs, so a PLANNED / ESTIMATED payment is charged and allocated
byte-identically to an ACTUAL settled one.

    :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` of its parent row
    (plan step **balance:X-bi-6a**, ruling **R-BAL13**) -- becomes a
    :class:`PlannedPayment` at what a SCREEN would show for it, which is what
    the amount model RESOLVES the parent to
    (:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.planned_leg_contribution`).  It was
    ``_planned_from_shadows`` until that step, taking the projected shadow rows
    and a map priced over their ids; a shadow's answer was its parent's (rule
    5), so the figure is the same and the walk is one row shorter.

    **It read ``settled_contribution`` with the live map laid over it by hand
    until plan step X-au-g-2c-1**, and that was the SECOND unrouted reader of a
    projected loan-side shadow -- the same row class, the same accessor, the
    same refusal.  The first was
    ``loan_payment_service.get_payment_history``; routing only that one would
    have left this to 500 the moment the cutover emptied the column, on
    ``/savings`` and every surface that folds a loan's forward plan.  An
    adversarial review found it by censusing the accessor's callers rather than
    trusting the finding's own count of them, which is the lesson: **"one
    unrouted reader" was itself an unmeasured claim.**

    The two-line merge it replaced -- a resolved figure with a live override on
    top -- was ``display_amounts_by_id``, extracted at X-au-c2b so one
    composition lived in one place rather than at two call sites (finding
    **N-224**'s shape).  Both cutovers have since deleted the override term
    itself, so that function collapsed onto ``amounts_by_id`` and the merge has
    no second half left to get wrong.

    **The cycle a much older draft blamed is DELETED and was never the
    reason.**  It read: asking the resolver here would ask the loan to price
    the rows its own price is derived from, because pricing routed
    ``resolve_transaction_amount`` -> ``LoanPricing.derive_cash`` ->
    ``_resolve_loan_basis`` -> ``load_loan_context`` ->
    ``get_payment_history``.  ``_resolve_loan_basis`` reads the loan's TERMS
    and nothing else
    (:func:`~app.services.loan_resolver.compute_monthly_payment_baseline`), so
    it loads no payment history at all.

    **Finding N-266 (a) is CLOSED at plan step X-au-g-2c-1, and its DIAGNOSIS
    was wrong twice before its remedy was right.**  It first recorded an
    irreducible CYCLE: the rule that priced a loan payment routed back through
    the payment feed.  Plan step X-au-g-1 deleted that path, leaving the
    conclusion standing on something smaller -- ``get_payment_history`` priced
    each row through
    :func:`~app.services.row_valuation.settled_contribution`, which refused a row
    whose plan was derived (since plan step X-bx it refuses any row that has not
    settled, whatever prices it) -- and the row was restated as **"ONE unrouted
    reader"**.  That count was itself unmeasured, and an adversarial review of
    X-au-g-2c-1 censused the accessor: there were **TWO**, and the second is
    this function.  Both are routed now, so the loan-side INCOME leg is
    declarable; had only the named one moved, the cutover would have 500'd
    every surface that folds a loan's forward plan.

    **The other six callers of that accessor really are settled-only**, which
    is what makes "two" a census rather than a second guess (a seventh,
    ``cash_ledger.settled_cash_leg``, is deleted at plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-4a``): ``loan_ledger._events.loan_event_stream``
    (``._split.split_one_payment`` until plan step X-au-g-2c-3b-2),
    ``loan_posting_service._sync`` and ``._display``,
    ``savings_dashboard_service._metrics``, and the spending report's
    ``_window`` and ``_breakdown`` -- each loading rows filtered to the settled
    statuses in SQL.

    **What has NOT changed is the DATA, and that is a fact about production
    rather than about the loan.**  ``ck_transactions_amount_ownership`` is a
    biconditional -- ``(amount_source_id IS NULL) = (estimated_amount IS NOT
    NULL)`` -- so a row states EITHER what prices it or its own figure, never
    both.  Every loan-payment shadow is still on the second side of it:
    re-measured against production 2026-09-01 (stamp ``a4c6f1d92b73``), all 58
    shadows and all 175 transfers carry ``amount_source_id IS NULL``, so the
    resolver classifies them ``AmountRule.OWN`` and answers from the very
    column the old fallback read.  **This routing therefore moves ``$0.00``**;
    what it removes is the interval in which stamping that column would have
    broken this surface.

    **Until then a projected row's figure is a stored copy of its definition's
    price and nothing keeps the two equal** (finding **N-401**, owned by
    ``X-au-f``).  They are equal today -- all 48
    projected loan shadows match their definition to the cent on the same clone
    -- but an edit to a generator-written row moves the derived payoff with no
    signal: halving the Van Loan's 24 future rows while the definition sat at
    ``$531.94`` moved it ``2029-02-22`` -> ``2030-04-22``.

    **Reading the DEFINITION here instead is not the remedy, and it is a money
    defect in its own right.**  It was built and reverted: an ad-hoc
    ``$2,100.00`` payment into a loan whose contractual installment is
    ``$2,035.15`` was repriced to ``$2,035.15``, discarding ``$64.85`` of
    principal the owner is actually paying
    (``test_loan_plan_assembly.test_a_projected_record_makes_its_slot_planned_not_estimated``
    is what caught it), and the underpayment direction is worse -- a ``$500.00``
    payment would project as ``$2,035.15`` and claim a payoff the owner never
    reaches.  BOTH directions of this column are wrong, which is the whole
    argument for the cutover: ``estimated_amount`` carries two facts, the plan's
    price and what the OWNER said, and no reading rule can tell them apart.
    ``amount_source_id`` is what distinguishes them.  **Stamping it used to
    FORCE this call site to move, and that is why it moved FIRST**: the old
    fallback raised on a NULL column, so the cutover that empties it would have
    taken this surface down in the interval before the move.  Routing ahead of
    the stamp is byte-identical -- every one of these rows carries
    ``amount_source_id IS NULL`` today, so the resolver dispatches to
    ``AmountRule.OWN`` and answers from the same column -- which is what makes
    it safe to do early rather than late.

    **It resolves NO rate and NO escrow since plan step R16-a**: those belong to
    the period, not to the payment, and the leaf's calendar resolves them on
    the installment's own date
    (:func:`~app.services.loan_ledger.with_contract_charges`, plan step
    recurrence:R16-c-2), which for a record due on the contractual day IS this
    record's due date, so ruling D5's contract time is unchanged.  What this

    a definition's level payment.

    **The one arm plan step R16-b-2 left here.**  Until that step this

    installment (``payment_date < as_of``) is never synthesized here: with no

    has no occurrence to price and B-9's rule stands for this arm.

    **An installment is COVERED when a record is due inside its interval** --
    from its own due date up to the next installment's, the interval a
    payment's charge is read from and, since ruling **R-R104**, its cash is

    loan due on the 22nd, a payment on the 10th covered the installment twelve
    days after it rather than the one it pays into.  Two kinds of record cover
    one, and BOTH matter -- the contractual synthesis is a schedule-row
    estimate, so it can collide with a real payment:

    * a **PLANNED** record -- a projected transfer this pass will fold forward;
    * a **settled** payment the pass's recorded stream already folds -- one
      settled by ``as_of`` whose installment is due at or after ``as_of`` (an
      early- or on-day-settled payment).  Without this the ESTIMATED tier would
      re-synthesize an installment the facts already paid, and the timeline's
      fold would subtract its principal a SECOND time (understating the debt by
      one installment).

    **The escrow PRICES the installment here and is CHARGED by the period**, and
    plan step R16-a is what separated the two.  The contract's installment is
    escrow-INCLUSIVE as the owner pays it, so this tier reads the escrow to
    know what the installment costs; what the fold then backs out of principal
    is the CHARGE the leaf's calendar states for the installment

    an UNDERPAYING loan is a balance behind the contractual schedule, so it has not
    reached zero at the contractual date, and these installments let it clear a few

"""Balance-at-T seam -- what a balance ASSERTION does to a running total.

Plan step **X-f3c-1** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md`` section 5).
The replay this module owns lived inside
:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.walk_cash_ledger` until then, and moving it here
is not a tidy-up: it is what makes the CUTOVER expressible.

**An assertion's effect on a balance is a POLICY, and the policy differs by
account kind.**  Ruling **R-FO** keeps the RESET for the modelled kinds -- an
IRA has no record of a price movement to discard, so the user's declaration is
the only fact and re-deriving the correction on every read IS mark-to-market --
while plan step **X-f3c** deletes it for the PLAIN ones, where the recorded
movements are the fact and an assertion is a CHECK against them (ruling
**R-FN**).  Two answers, one question.

The walk could state neither.  Ruling **R-J** makes it kind-blind, so it cannot
branch; and while it hardcoded the reset it imposed the modelled kinds' answer
on the cash ones, which is exactly the coupling that made the cutover a rewrite
of a leaf instead of a deletion in a fold.  So the replay lives HERE, beside the
running total it is a policy about, and each fold applies what its own kind
needs: :mod:`._cash_fold` for PLAIN, :mod:`._asset_fold` for the modelled kinds.

**What plan step X-d must decide, named here rather than discovered there.**
That step wires the POSTING writer onto the cash walk, and each of these
corrections is what it books as a balanced journal entry.  It can no longer
reach them: ``account_posting_service`` importing ``balance_at._assertions`` is
a private-module import in every spelling (W9910,
:mod:`tools.pylint.shekel_checkers.package_privacy` -- no allowlist, and
``TYPE_CHECKING`` is not exempt).  So X-d chooses between giving the seam a
PUBLIC entry the writer takes, and having the writer re-implement the replay --
which would recreate the two-independent-statements drift the walk's own
"one walk closes it by construction" exists to remove.  The choice is smaller
than it looks after plan step X-f3c-5: a PLAIN account books no
``account_trueup`` at all there, so what survives is the modelled kinds' half.
The RESIDUE decision two paragraphs down in :mod:`app.services.cash_ledger._walk`
is named for the same reason (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 8).

**It is a prefix sum, which is the other reason it is here.**
:attr:`CashAnchorCorrection.balance_before` is the account's balance an instant
before an assertion -- a balance-at-T by any reading -- and the cash ledger's
producer set is EMPTY and stays empty (the W9909 registry's own words).  Stating
it in a private ``balance_at`` submodule is the placement that classification
exists to force, rather than a non-producer ruling that would have to argue a
running total is not a balance.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no query, no write; all
money is :class:`~decimal.Decimal`.

    The per-assertion result of :func:`assertion_corrections`.  The correction's
    delta is ``anchor_balance - balance_before``: the jump the user's assertion
    booked over what the recorded facts alone would have produced.  A correction
    whose ``balance_before`` already equals the asserted balance books nothing,
    which is the healthy steady state -- an account whose every movement is
    recorded needs no correction at all.

    On the write side (plan step X-d) each of these becomes a balanced journal
    entry, the opening tagged ``account_opening`` and every later one

            zero since plan step **X-f3c-2a**, which is what makes the FIRST

            at the level its records imply, the opening's ``delta`` is
            ``0.00``, where it used to be the whole opening equity that the

    """Replay *walk*'s facts under the RESET, returning one correction each.

    Seeds the running balance at the account's stored OPENING EQUITY
    (:attr:`~app.services.cash_ledger.CashLedgerWalk.opening`) and, per
    assertion in business-date order, advances it by every settled source that
    assertion CLEARED
    (:meth:`app.services.cash_ledger.StatementCoverage.clearing_anchor_id`),
    records what the balance was JUST BEFORE, then RESETS it to the asserted
    value.

    **The seed is a RECORDED FACT since plan step X-f3c-2a, and that is what
    makes every assertion the same kind of thing.**  This replay started at
    zero, so the first assertion's correction came out as the whole of what the
    account held before its records began -- a quantity the fold then had to
    move into its own seed and cancel with an equal-and-opposite step (ruling
    **R-I**), and which was silently re-elected whenever an assertion was
    BACK-DATED, because "the opening" was decided by sort position.  Reading
    the level from ``budget.account_openings`` deletes the special case rather
    than relocating it: ``corrections[0]`` is now an ordinary correction whose
    delta is the difference between what the owner declared and what the books
    say, ``$0.00`` on every production account the migration seeded.

    **Resetting at EVERY assertion -- not seeding from the latest one -- is what
    makes the past the assertion history.**  The shipping projection read only
    the newest anchor (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_anchor`) and
    carried it BACKWARD over the past, which is why a pre-anchor date read
    today's balance rather than the balance the user actually asserted then
    (finding B-18 / cash D3: measured on production 2026-07-25, the scalar
    answers ``$2,932.41`` for 2026-06-03 while the period map omits those 8
    periods entirely).  Replaying all of them -- **61 on the real Checking
    account, measured on a production clone 2026-08-27** against the 52 over 119
    days ``._events.cash_anchor_facts`` records for 2026-07-25 -- means the past
    is what the user recorded rather than a back-projection of the present.

    **A settled source attributed AFTER the latest assertion rides on top of it,
    and that is the money the app currently loses.**  Today's shipping
    projection excludes every settled row (the anchor is assumed to reflect
    them) and the anchor predates them, so they are counted by NO producer until
    the user re-asserts the balance: measured on production 2026-07-25,
    ``$2,108.15`` invisible at that instant, and ``$53,880.81`` gross across 130
    rows over 45 assertion gaps historically (finding cash D1).  Here such a
    source is in no bucket at all and the fold's own step list carries it.

    **Which assertion clears a source is ASSIGNED, not scanned, and that is
    ruling R-FL** (plan step X-f3a-1).  This advanced a monotonic ``absorbed``
    pointer through the day-sorted sources while the current assertion
    ``covers`` them, which was correct only while "cleared by this assertion"
    was monotone in the day.  A RECORDED clearing fact is not: statement B
    legitimately clears a line dated before one of statement A's, and a pointer
    meeting that line halts and silently shorts every later assertion.  So
    :class:`~app.services.cash_ledger.StatementCoverage` answers per source,
    this loop groups by the answer, and the loaders' ordering stops being a
    precondition of the money being right.  Two assertions about ONE day are
    still not a conflict: an unlinked source lands on the first of them, the
    second absorbs nothing, and the LAST is that day's closing balance -- which
    is what a user re-reading their bank later the same day means.

    **The loaders' ordering is still a contract, for a smaller reason.**
    ``cash_anchor_facts`` returns assertions ascending by
    ``(observed_on, created_at, id)`` -- BUSINESS date first, which is what the
    coverage rule bisects and what makes "the FIRST is the opening" true -- and
    ``settled_cash_facts`` returns sources ascending by
    ``(settled_on, transaction_id, entry_id)``, which keeps the replay
    reproducible.  Neither is load-bearing for WHICH assertion absorbs what.

    **It is not the whole of what an assertion means, and plan step X-f3c is
    why.**  A caller applying these deltas to its step list has chosen the RESET
    (ruling R-S, "an assertion always wins"), which is correct for the modelled
    kinds and is what the cutover deletes for the PLAIN ones.  A PLAIN caller
    after that step still asks for these corrections -- the difference between
    what the user declared and what the records hold is the RESIDUAL it
    displays -- and simply does not book them as steps.

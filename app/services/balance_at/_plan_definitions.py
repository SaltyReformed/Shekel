"""Balance-at-T seam -- the ESTIMATED tier's DEFINITION walk.

Plan step **R16-b-2**.  What a generate pass over the owner's whole schedule
would write for every recurring transfer into a loan, priced as those rows
would be priced -- the summing leaf of the R16 arc, split out of :mod:`._plan`
when that module crossed pylint's 1000-line ceiling (see
:mod:`._plan_records` for the split and its reasons).  :mod:`._plan` calls
:func:`estimated_from_definitions` from its assembly and owns the contract-only
estimate, the charge calendar and the read pass's memo; this module owns the
three steps between a definition and its estimated payments -- which
occurrences it names, which of them a row already answers, and what each
would cost -- and imports nothing from ``_plan``.

The rulings it applies are stated on the functions: **R-R64** (an occurrence
no row in any state answers is priced, past or future, bounded to the
schedule), **R-R65** (the authored closing alone; the derived stop is the
fold's own output), **R-R66** (``budget.transfers`` read for identity only),
**R-R67** (the amount model's own arm) and **R-R69** (dated as the row would
be).  The occurrences it prices are bounded BELOW by the caller: an occurrence
due at or before the loan's latest assertion -- its origination at the
earliest, which is ruling R-C's refusal -- is dropped by :func:`._plan.loan_plan`
on the one post-anchor predicate (ruling **R-R72**).

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes; all money is

    **The fold reads ``budget.transfers`` here for OCCURRENCE IDENTITY and for

    row's identity is the occurrence it answers -- ``(transfer_template_id,
    scenario_id, occurs_on)``, the key both unique indexes carry since plan
    step R17 -- and that column is deliberately NOT mirrored onto the shadow
    transactions the balance fold reads money from.  So "has this occurrence
    been answered" cannot be asked of ``budget.transactions`` at all, and
    asking it of the parent rows through the one claim rule generation applies
    (:class:`~app.services._recurrence_common.OccurrenceClaims`, over the same
    scoped fetch, :func:`~app.services._recurrence_common.rows_claiming`) is
    what makes the estimate and the generate pass agree by construction about
    which occurrences a row already holds.  No figure is read off any row
    here; the fold's money still comes only from ``budget.transactions``,
    which is the double-counting Transfer Invariant 5 exists to prevent, and
    the invariant's text carries this clause since this step (``CLAUDE.md``,
    Transfer Invariants).

    **Every state counts** -- immutable, overridden, cancelled, soft-deleted
    -- exactly as the generate path has always counted them: a row the owner
    removed must not be resurrected by the estimate any more than by a pass.
    A row answering no occurrence (``occurs_on`` NULL: a hand-made or
    carried-forward row) claims its whole paycheck, which a projected period
    (``period_id`` ``None``) can never be.

    (:attr:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.ResolvedLoan.definitions`,
    loaded once per pass; ruling **R-R35**: every one of them is a payment
    against it):

    1. resolve its rule against the owner's calendar with the PURE resolver
       and walk it under its AUTHORED closing alone.  Never through the
       composed door: that door's derived stop is a loan's closing date,
       which is THIS fold's output, and a fold reading its own answer is the
       fixed point ruling **R-R65** refused to scaffold.  The authored half is
       read through :func:`~app.services.balance_at._resolution.authored_closing`
       (ruling **R-R56**: the standing payment's stored column is the
       chokepoints' cache, so it binds by nothing and the fold's own zero
       crossing is its stop), so a second definition's authored end date is
       honoured (ruling **R-R37**) and the loan's own payment runs to payoff;
    2. place each occurrence on the paycheck its row would live in, saved or
       projected (:func:`~app.services.recurrence.projected_occurrence_placements`);
       an occurrence the schedule cannot place is dropped, which is ruling
       **R-R64**'s boundary;
    3. drop each occurrence a row of this definition already answers, in any
       state (:func:`_answered_by_rows`);
    4. date what is left as generation would date its row
       (:func:`~app.services.recurrence.compute_due_date`, ruling **R-R69**)
       and price it through the amount model's own arm
       (:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.definition_cash`, ruling **R-R67**).

    Occurrences PAST as well as future are priced (ruling **R-R64**): an
    occurrence the schedule places that nothing answers is "not generated
    yet", and clamping its visible date to ``as_of + 1d`` is exactly what
    the PLANNED tier does with the overdue projected row generation would
    have written (ruling D1).

    The walk's window (*through*) is the caller's: :func:`._plan.loan_plan`
    hands the later of the post-contractual extension's end
    (``_plan._extension_dates``) and the same span past the read, so a
    matured loan still owing is walked past today.  A definition still
    firing past the window belongs to a loan the plan cannot retire, which
    :func:`._plan_fold.plan_payoff_date` reports as ``None``.  An occurrence
    the loan's latest assertion subsumes (due at or before it) is priced
    here and dropped by the caller, on the one predicate its planned rows
    are dropped on (ruling **R-R72**).

    Args:
        account: The loan account.  Must belong to ``ctx.user_id``.
        resolved: The pass's resolution of the loan -- its definitions and
            its params.
        ctx: The read pass -- its calendar places the occurrences, its
            scenario scopes the rows, its basis prices the occurrences.
        as_of: The read pass's as-of -- the clamp floor is ``as_of + 1d``.
        through: The last day the walk covers.

    Returns:
        One :class:`PlannedPayment` per unanswered placeable occurrence of
        every definition (``is_estimated=True``), in walk order per
        definition; the caller sorts.

    Raises:
        AmountUnresolvable: When a definition states no price for an
            occurrence (an empty series, a derive-mode payment whose loan will
            not resolve) -- exactly where its written row would refuse.

"""Balance-at-T seam -- what an account's own BOOKS cannot explain.

Plan step **X-f3c-3** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md`` section
5), and it moves no money: it is the INSTRUMENT plan step X-f3c-4's acceptance
act needs, built one step ahead of it so the figure is on screen before
anything offers to book it.

**One figure per account, and never a per-assertion correction.**  The owner's
latest declared balance, less what the account's books produce for that same
day -- its stored opening equity plus every posting dated on or before it.
Ruling **R-FN** is why it is ONE figure: the per-assertion plug is DEFINED as
whatever forces the ledger to the balance just declared, so the plugs telescope
and their net is a function of the LAST assertion alone.  Booking them
individually would record over ``$1,500`` of "spending" on one day and a
comparable "income" the next, either side of the mortgage payment that caused
both.

**It is the POST-CUTOVER balance function, read today.**  Plan step X-f3c-5
makes ``balance(T)`` exactly ``opening equity + SUM(postings <= T)`` for a
PLAIN account; :func:`_books_balance_at` below is that function, assembled out
of the same walk and sampled through the same
:func:`~._fold.sample_cumulative` the shipping fold uses.  So this step does
not model the cutover, it EVALUATES it -- and what the difference measures is
precisely what the flip will leave unexplained on the day it lands.  Measured
on a clone of the dev database 2026-09-01: Checking asserts ``$2,501.31`` for
2026-08-18 where its books produce ``$131.29``, a difference of
``$2,370.02``.

**PLAIN accounts only, and that is the same scope**
:func:`~._cash_flow.records_balance_at` **already states.**  A modelled
account's assertion is not a check against recorded cash: an IRA has no record
of a price movement to discard, so the reset IS mark-to-market and the same
subtraction is its GAIN (ruling **R-FO**).  Captioning that as something the
books cannot explain would name a model-vs-market difference as untracked
spend -- on the clone above it would read ``$4,523.33`` on the Roth IRA, which
is return, not a defect.  Widening the question to those kinds is finding
**N-213**.

**Its own module rather than a fifth entry in** :mod:`._cash_flow`, for the
reason :mod:`._cash_periods` is one: this is the assembled fold read a fourth
way, it shares exactly one input with the readings beside it
(:class:`~._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold`), and the dependency runs one way.
The placement also has a job at X-f3c-5 -- the flip is then a matter of
pointing the PLAIN fold at the reading in here, rather than editing the reading
back out of a module that answers four other questions.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes; all money is
:class:`~decimal.Decimal`.

    **The latest assertion is read off the walk's ORDER, never re-derived.**
    :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.cash_anchor_facts` loads its rows

    that order, and the two agreed for free only while ``observed_on`` was
    derived from ``created_at``; plan step 2 made the column user-supplied and
    broke that.

    **The books side is the fold's own prefix sum, not a fresh subtraction.**
    :func:`_books_balance_at` seeds at the assembly's stored opening equity and
    samples the leaf's :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.dated_deltas` through
    the shared :func:`~._fold.sample_cumulative` -- the same re-key the posting

    package is read off.  Summing ``walk.source_facts`` here instead would be a
    third statement of "which day does this event count from, and for how
    much", which is precisely how the fold and the posted ledger drift apart.

    **Cross-checked against a producer that shares no code with it.**  On a
    clone of the dev database migrated to head, 2026-09-01, Checking's figure
    is ``$2,370.02`` -- and the persisted double-entry ledger, written by
    ``account_posting_service`` and read by SQL that touches this package at no
    point, carries exactly ``$2,370.02`` of ``account_trueup`` postings on that
    account's linked ledger account with ``-$2,370.02`` against
    ``Checking -- Opening`` equity.  That equity leg is finding **N-171**, and
    it is what plan step X-f3c-4 moves onto the income statement.

    **THREE figures name that leg across the corpus and they do not contradict
    each other -- they are one quantity measured on three dates.**
    ``ledger.md``'s N-171 row says ``$15,065.08`` gross / ``-$1,495.10`` net
    "over four months"; the balance README's X-f3c-4 entry says ``$1,776.88``;
    this says ``$2,370.02`` on 2026-09-01.  The plug is the NET of every
    assertion's correction, so it moves every time the owner declares a
    balance -- which is why each of the three needs its date carried beside it,
    and why X-f3c-4 must RE-DERIVE rather than quote any of them.

    Args:
        account: The account to measure.  Must belong to ``ctx.user_id``, which
            :func:`~._cash_fold.assembled_fold` REFUSES rather than trusts.
            Must be attached to ``db.session``.  Its KIND is consulted once,
            for the scope below.
        ctx: The read pass's :class:`~._context.BalanceContext`.  Its scenario
            scopes the postings the books side folds; assertions and the
            opening are per-ACCOUNT and are the same in every scenario.  Its
            ``as_of`` decides nothing here -- every assertion has already
            happened (:func:`app.services.anchor_service.resolve_observation_day`
            refuses a future day at both write doors), so there is no clock to
            bound them by.

    Returns:
        The :class:`CashOutstandingDifference`, or ``None`` in the two cases
        where the question does not apply: an account whose balance carries a
        MODELLED tier (see the module docstring -- ruling **R-FO**, finding
        **N-213**), and an account carrying no assertion at all, which has
        declared nothing for its books to disagree with.  The second is
        production-unreachable, and what makes it so TODAY is
        ``account_service.create_account``, which writes an origination
        assertion and CHECKS that it landed; migration ``cfb15e782f86``
        backfilled the accounts that predated the rule and its own header

    this is what it is checked against).  Dropping the PLAN is the definition
    rather than an optimisation: the BOOKS are what the account has RECORDED,
    and what it is projected to hold is a different question this figure must
    not answer.

    *A first draft justified the omission by arguing it changed nothing -- that
    ruling R-G clamps a still-projected row to ``as_of + 1`` and an assertion's
    day has already happened.  That is true only for a pass reading at TODAY.*
    :meth:`~._context.BalanceContext.build` *takes an ``as_of``, and a pass
    pinned to a past one clamps the plan to a day that can precede the latest
    assertion -- so the two readings would then differ, and an argument that
    the choice is free would be false exactly where it was load-bearing.  The

    :class:`~._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold` -- which already carries a
    ``too-many-instance-attributes`` disable -- or summing ``source_facts``
    here, which would be a second statement of the one clock.  ``dated_deltas``
    is a PURE function of the walk, so calling it twice cannot produce two
    answers; what it costs is one list build and one sort over the account's
    settled rows (354 on the real Checking account).

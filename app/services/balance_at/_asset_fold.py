"""Balance-at-T seam -- the MODELLED fold: a cash fold plus a modelled return.

Plan step **X-g1** (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md`` Section 3.2).
"A modelled asset is an event stream", and the stream is the CASH one with two
more event kinds on it::

    AssetEvent = (effective_date, kind, payload)

    kind = ASSERTION    balance := asserted_value      (AccountAnchorHistory, EVERY row)
         | ACTUAL       balance += settled_cash_leg    (settled rows)
         | PLANNED      balance += reservation         (still-projected, clamped, R-G)
         | CONTRIBUTION balance += modelled_rate       (payroll deductions + employer)
         | ACCRUAL      balance += balance * rate      (modelled return, DAILY, R-T)

The first three are exactly :mod:`app.services.balance_at._cash_fold`'s three
tiers, taken whole through :func:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.assemble`
rather than re-derived -- which is the structural claim this module exists to
make: an INTEREST account, an INVESTMENT and a Property are not three questions,
they are the cash fold plus a rate.  The retired interest layer said exactly
that in its own words ("that module models an INVESTMENT's growth and an
APPRECIATING asset's appreciation on top of their cash bases, and this one models
an INTEREST account's accrual on top of its folded cash balance") years before
there was a shape that could express it; plan step X-g4b deleted it, and this
module is the sentence made structural.

**ACCRUAL is the only MULTIPLICATIVE kind, and that is the whole difference.**
Its delta is a function of the running balance at its own instant, so resolving
it must be sequential (:func:`_resolve`).  Between two events the balance is
constant, so ONE pass over the merged, date-ordered event list resolves every
accrual on the horizon into ordinary dated deltas -- after which
:func:`~app.services.balance_at._fold.sample_cumulative`, the sampler this
module shares with the LOAN fold and the cash fold, is unchanged.  Generalising
that sampler to be balance-dependent would have put this step's blast radius on
the loan side for no gain.

**What it REPLACED, and why the replacement was not a preference** (wired at
plan step X-g2b, and the producers it replaced were deleted at X-g4b).  A
modelled account's map used to be three producers merged by a preference
order -- a forward growth projection, the anchor-forward cash base, and a
REVERSE growth projection.  Measured on the prod-shape clone, that merge
rendered **$6,315.57** of net-worth history contradicting the user's own
recorded balance assertions: the three modelled accounts carry 15 of them and
the map read only the LATEST, re-deriving every earlier period from a model
(findings N-43 / N-74).  A fold has no join, so it has no join rule to get
wrong: every ASSERTION is replayed as a reset, which is what makes the earlier
periods read the numbers the user typed in.

**Four rules decide where the modelled tiers start and what they are worth.**

* **Ruling R-L, generalised at ruling R-Y.**  ACCRUAL exists only on days at or
  after the LATEST balance assertion, and the assertion's OWN day accrues.
  Everything at or before it is a bank fact the user typed in, and modelling
  across those days adds money the assertion already contains.  The retired
  interest layer had done this since plan step X-c2a -- before it, accrual began
  at the anchor PERIOD's start, up to 13 days early, worth $6.77 over 14 days on
  the real Fidelity Savings where the honest window earns $1.45 over 3 -- and
  ruling R-Y extended it to INVESTMENT and APPRECIATING, which skipped the anchor
  PERIOD entirely and so silently dropped up to a full period of return
  (measured: Roth +$105.26, Trad IRA +$44.95, Empower +$76.59, Property +$170.11
  at the anchor period).
* **The DAY-COUNT class stops being representable, and it is recorded here
  because the module that recorded it is gone.**  The retired per-period layer
  had to convert a pay period's INCLUSIVE ``end_date`` into the exclusive right
  boundary its interest formula wanted, and getting that wrong counted 13 days of
  a 14-day period -- understating a HYSA's yield by ~1 day in 14 (~7%), the
  interest-path twin of the growth engine's own day-count defect.  A date-keyed
  daily ACCRUAL has no period boundary to convert, so there is no convention left
  to misstate.
* **Ruling R-S.**  There is no backward direction.  Before the FIRST assertion
  the balance is ruling R-I's back-projection over the records it already
  contains -- the cash fold's own answer, inherited here for free -- and the
  reverse growth projection leaves the balance path entirely.
* **Ruling R-T.**  ACCRUAL is DAILY.  A step exists for every day, so a sampled
  date never falls inside an unresolved span and the answer never depends on
  which OTHER dates were asked for.
* **Ruling R-X.**  A day's accrual is computed at FULL precision and credited in
  whole cents, carrying the sub-cent remainder
  (:func:`_resolve`).  Every emitted step is therefore an exact cent -- so the
  grid identity stays exact by construction -- while the cumulative accrual at
  every date equals ``round(exact)``.  Rounding each day independently instead
  would make a small balance accrue nothing at all, forever: 0.45 cents a day on
  a $50 HYSA at 3.29% APY rounds to zero every day, and a $20 holding at 10.5%
  would grow $3.65 a year against a true $2.00.

**Ruling R-R partitions a contribution by SOURCE**, which is what makes the two
feeds disjoint by construction rather than by a de-dup rule: a recorded transfer
HAS a transaction row, so it is already an ACTUAL / PLANNED event; a payroll
deduction never has one, so it is a modelled CONTRIBUTION event.  That tier is
:mod:`app.services.balance_at._asset_contributions`, split off here at plan step
X-g2a on plan step D1c's cohesion line; this module asks it for dated events and
states no contribution rule of its own.

**Assembly and resolution are separate entries** (plan step X-g2a).
:func:`resolve` takes an ALREADY-assembled
:class:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold`, so a reader that
needs the cash period columns AND the modelled tiers off one account -- the
budget grid, from plan step X-g2b -- pays for ONE walk, ONE plan load and ONE
valuation.  :func:`fold_asset_balances` and :func:`asset_period_view` are the
convenience entries that assemble first, for the readers that want only the
modelled answer.

**TOTAL over every date and every account, like the folds it extends.**  An
account that models no return (an INTEREST account whose params row is absent,
an INVESTMENT with no ``InvestmentParams``) IS its cash fold; a date before every
event reads the seed; a future date answers.  The one place it fails loud is a
modelled account with NO assertion history at all, which has no honest window to
open an accrual on -- the same deliberate asymmetry
:func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.resolve_anchor` already enforces for the
interest path.

"""
Shekel Budget App -- Net-Worth Kernel (shared per-account balance chain).

The single, Flask-free home for the per-account balance-map projection
chain the ``balance_at`` seam dispatches through.  Promoted out of
``year_end_summary_service._balances`` (Loop B Phase 1) when the year-end
summary and the savings cockpit computed net worth from two copies of the
same math that could drift; the year-end consumer has since been deleted
(plan step F2).

**There is no per-kind dispatch left here** (plan step X-g2b, ruling R-AD).
Every non-loan account's map is ONE event replay
(:func:`app.services.balance_at._asset_fold.asset_period_view`): an account
that models a return gets its ACCRUAL and CONTRIBUTION tiers, and an account
that models none IS its cash fold, which is the same statement rather than a
fall-through.  The ladder this module used to hold -- INVESTMENT to the growth
engine, APPRECIATING to the appreciation curve, INTEREST to the accrual layer,
everything else to the cash fold -- had four branches for one question, and
each branch answered a period rather than a date (finding N-71) and spliced
three sources by a preference order (findings N-43 / N-74).  Verified before
the ladder was deleted: on both real databases the replay reproduces the PLAIN
fall-through to the cent on every one of 60 columns, for all three real plain
accounts.

AMORTIZING loans are NOT dispatched here at all: the seam reads its own
``positions()``-based map for them (plan step C3b3), because that producer sits
above this module.  An AMORTIZING account with no ``LoanParams`` does reach
here, and models no return, so it is its cash fold -- the same degrade the
seam's scalar makes.

The cockpit's forward net-worth trend PROJECTS investment and retirement
growth forward, and that forward WHAT-IF keeps ``growth_engine`` (ruling R-U);
what moved here is the balance-at-T half.  The loan SCHEDULE bundle
(``DebtSchedule``, with ``generate_debt_schedules`` and the rows accessor
``debt_schedule_rows``) lived here for that trend's history gate until plan
step recurrence:R16-c-2, where ruling R-R112 gates every loan from its
recorded start instead; no schedule is read there now, so the three went
with their last caller.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``: "services are isolated from Flask"): this
module imports no Flask symbol and performs no database writes.  Since plan
step X-c2b3 it issues no QUERY either -- every row it dispatches over is loaded
by the leaf or the fold below it.  All money is :class:`~decimal.Decimal`;
``float`` belongs only at a route's Chart.js serialization boundary, never
here.

Its public producers take ONE per-account bundle
(:class:`~app.services.balance_at._asset_contributions.ContributionInputs`)
rather than the three loose parameters the growth-engine dispatch needed, and
the wider seam bundle is sliced into it by :mod:`._inputs`, where that bundle
is defined -- so this module no longer duck-types a value object it must not
import (plan step X-g2b; the slice used to live here as
``account_balance_map_from_inputs``).

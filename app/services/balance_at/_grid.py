"""Balance-at-T seam -- the GRID kind-aware cash-flow view.

The budget grid is a single-account cash-flow surface (it reads the cash FOLD,
:mod:`._cash_fold`), but it is NOT always pointed at a cash account
(``resolve_grid_account`` falls back to any active account).  For a grid account
that MODELS a return -- an INTEREST-bearing HYSA / Money Market / CD / HSA, an
INVESTMENT, or an APPRECIATING asset -- the pure transaction running-balance
understates the real balance, because it ignores the return the net-worth
surfaces already credit.  This view gives such an account the modelled balance
AND the per-period modelled figures that explain the part of the balance change
the transactions do not -- so the grid's balance row still reconciles with the
rows above it.

**ONE per-period column, from ONE producer pass** (plan steps X-c2b1 / X-c2b2,
ruling R-K).  Every figure the grid renders for one pay period -- the projected
end balance, the income and expense subtotals, the two remainders ("Period
timing" and "Book vs bank"), the modelled contribution and the modelled
accrual -- is one
:class:`GridColumn`, and all but the last two come from a single
:func:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_periods.period_view_of`: one walk, one
plan load, one valuation, grouped on the two clocks the identity binds.

    balance[p] - balance[p-1]
        == net[p] + elsewhere[p] + period_timing[p] + book_vs_bank[p]
           + contribution[p] + accrual[p]

The grid used to compute those figures in three independent producer passes a
test then had to keep in step (finding N-48), against a subtotal that counted
only still-UNPAID rows while the balance counted the anchor plus the same rows
-- an identity that held only because neither side could see a settled row at
all, and that broke on 8 of 59 real period pairs (worst ``$2,505.17``) the
moment the balance became a fold (finding N-41).  Reading one row set grouped
two ways makes the identity a property of the object the template reads.

**The subtotals are the PAYCHECK's, across the owner's cash-flow set, and the
balance is ONE account's -- so the identity carries ``elsewhere[p]``** (developer
ruling ``credit_card:R-CC16``, plan step CC-4-1).  A plan item's ``account_id``
is the account its money is expected to move through, the phone bill that is
always paid by card being a row ON the card; the grid reads checking and its
cards as one set (:class:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.CashFlowSet`), so
``income`` / ``expense`` / ``net`` sum every member's rows -- the balance
account's through :func:`._cash_periods.period_view_of` and each other member's
through :func:`._cash_periods.paycheck_legs`, each off ITS OWN assembled fold
-- while ``balance`` stays the balance account's.  What the paycheck budgets on
the other members does not move that balance, and ``elsewhere[p]`` names it:
the other members' expense less their income, the sign that makes the identity
read forward.  Rendered "On other accounts", it is the figure the ``Credit``
cheat showed the owner as the Credit rows' total.  It is computed FROM the
other members' legs, never as a residual of the balance change, for the reason
:func:`._cash_periods._assemble_figures` gives for its two remainders.  A
transfer between two members counts ONCE, from the balance line's side
(ruling ``credit_card:R-CC23``; :mod:`app.services.cash_flow_set`).  On the
ruling's example -- phone ``$45`` on the card, grocery ``$500`` on checking, a
``$165`` checking -> card payment in the same paycheck -- Total Expenses reads
``$710``, Net ``-$710``, On other accounts ``+$45``, and checking's balance
moves ``-$665``.  A one-member set (no cards) carries ``elsewhere = 0.00`` in
every column and the R-O rule hides the row, so the RENDER of such an owner's
grid is byte-for-byte what it was before this step (measured on a production
clone, 2026-09-18); the record itself gained the field, and its three
subtotals are now rounded once each over the composed legs rather than read
off the cash column verbatim -- equal under the seam's standing premise that
every leg is cent-quantized.

**The identity carries FOUR terms, not three** (ruling R-W as corrected at
X-g2b, measured at ruling R-AH).  A modelled asset has TWO modelled tiers, and
on the real Empower 401(k) the CONTRIBUTION is the larger of them
(``$9,624.27`` against ``$8,152.58`` over the horizon): the three-term form
breaks on 53 of 59 period pairs, worst ``$181.59`` a column, and the four-term
form on none.  So the seam carries both tiers apart -- they answer different
questions, what the market did and what the user put in
(:func:`._asset_fold.asset_growth_at`) -- and the grid renders them as two rows
rather than one sum, which could otherwise report a gain on an account that lost
money.

**THERE IS NO KIND GATE, and its deletion is what plan step X-g3b was**
(ruling R-W, closing finding N-76).  Every account -- PLAIN, INTEREST,
INVESTMENT, APPRECIATING, and a loan the resolver cannot configure -- reaches
:func:`._asset_fold.resolve`, which is resolved over the very
:class:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold` this view regroups
into its cash columns (ONE walk, one plan load, one valuation).  The replay
decides what it decides: an account whose parameters model no return has no
ACCRUAL tier and one whose payroll does not fund it has no CONTRIBUTION tier, so
its columns ARE its cash fold.  A gate here would be a second statement of that
decision -- the shape plan Section 8 rules a defect -- and it was one: it read
``accrual_params(account) is None`` and so admitted exactly the INTEREST kind,
leaving an INVESTMENT or an APPRECIATING asset on the kind-blind cash basis
here while ``/savings`` answered it modelled.  Measured before the cutover, at
the last projected period on BOTH databases: the Empower 401(k) rendered
``$31,070.06`` here against ``$48,846.91`` there, with nothing on screen
explaining the gap.  (Ruling R-W recorded ``$48,712.19`` for the same figure on
2026-07-26; the ``$134.72`` between them is NOT explained here, because it was
not measured -- one day of this account's accrual is nearer ``$10``.  The
figure above is the one this cutover moved, re-measured on the day it shipped.)
The grid's balance now equals ``balance_map``'s on **900 of 900** (account,
period) pairs across both databases, which is the unification stated as a
property rather than as an aspiration.

**The cost this moved, stated per RENDER rather than per call.**  A modelled
grid account's column set now costs its contribution load -- an
investment-params query, a deductions query and a raise-aware gross fetch, the
same load ``/savings`` already pays for the same account -- measured
best-of-five on both databases at ``2.7 -> 14.8 ms`` for an INVESTMENT and
``2.7 -> 3.7 ms`` for an APPRECIATING asset, with PLAIN and INTEREST inside
run-to-run noise.  It is paid by EVERY grid render entry, including
``subtotal_rows``, which reads only ``income`` / ``expense`` / ``net`` off the
result; and the gross fetch loads the pay-period calendar a THIRD time in a
render that has already loaded it twice (findings **N-89** and **N-92**, both
recorded and both waiting on one context memo -- finding **N-93** records what
this step added to them).

**The replay's one fail-loud is now reachable from this surface too.**  A
modelled account carrying ZERO ``AccountAnchorHistory`` rows has no honest day
to open an accrual window on, so :func:`._asset_fold._latest_assertion_day`
raises rather than inventing one -- and deleting the gate widens that from
``/savings`` to ``/grid`` for the INVESTMENT and APPRECIATING kinds (INTEREST
already reached it).  The state is unreachable in production
(``account_service.create_account`` and migration ``cfb15e782f86`` guarantee
every account an opening row) and it is deliberate where it can happen, so no
guard is added here; it is stated because the blast radius moved to the landing
page.

**A loan is the one kind this view answers on the cash basis, and it is the
replay that decides so.**  Its amortization schedule drives its real balance
(principal paydown) while its grid "transactions" are payment transfers recorded
as income -- opposite sign, different magnitude -- so no accrual row reconciles
them.  Ruling D4 refuses a loan at the RESOLVER (``resolve_grid_account`` and
``resolve_analytics_cash_flow_set`` both skip amortizing accounts), so this is a
degenerate safety rather than a supported view; the replay reaches it anyway and
returns the cash fold, because ``_modelled_return`` models nothing for the
AMORTIZING kind.  An AMORTIZING account with no ``LoanParams`` lands in the same
place and belongs there.

        balance: The projected end balance the surface displays, cent-quantized
            -- the modelled balance for an account that models a return, the
            folded cash balance for every other kind.  Never ``None``: the fold
            is TOTAL, so every requested period has one.  (It was optional while
            the projection carried the anchor forward and omitted every
            pre-anchor period; on the real Checking account eight columns
            rendered ``--`` for periods it plainly held money in.)
        income: The period's income subtotal, cent-quantized -- every row
            ATTRIBUTED to the period, settled at its confirmed cash leg and
            still-projected at its live or entries-aware amount (ruling R-K).
        expense: The same, for expense rows, so the column reads ``income``
            minus ``expense``.  A magnitude in the ordinary case and not a
            bound -- see
            :attr:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_periods.CashPeriodFigures.expense`,
            which this reads unchanged, for the two shapes that invert one.
        net: ``round_money(income - expense)`` -- rounded ONCE at the boundary
            rather than as the difference of two separately-rounded legs,

            ``credit_card:R-CC16``): every member of the owner's cash-flow set
            contributes its rows, the balance account's through
            :func:`._cash_periods.period_view_of` and each card's through
            :func:`._cash_periods.paycheck_legs`.
        elsewhere: What the paycheck budgets on the set's OTHER accounts --
            their expense less their income, cent-quantized -- rendered "On
            other accounts".  The term that reconciles a paycheck-wide
            ``net`` with a one-account ``balance``: ``net + elsewhere`` is the
            balance account's own budget-clock net.  ``0.00`` in every column
            for an owner with no card, and for a balance line outside the set.
            Computed from the other members' legs, never as a residual.
        period_timing: Ruling R-K's remainder from the ROWS, rendered as
            "Period timing": money budgeted to this period that moved in
            another (or has not moved yet), and money that moved here but is
            budgeted elsewhere.
        book_vs_bank: Ruling R-K's remainder from the ASSERTIONS, rendered as
            "Book vs bank": what each balance true-up inside the period booked
            -- the gap between what the app had recorded and what the bank
            actually showed.
        contribution: The period's modelled CONTRIBUTION -- what the account's
            payroll puts in, employee plus employer (the read-only
            "Contributions" row).  ``0.00`` for every kind but INVESTMENT, whose
            feed is the only one that exists
            (:func:`._asset_contributions.contribution_events`).
        accrual: The period's modelled RETURN -- interest, market growth or
            appreciation (the read-only accrual row, whose LABEL the route
            resolves per kind, ruling R-AI).  ``0.00`` for an account that
            models none.

    **Neither modelled field is optional, and that is ruling R-AJ (c).**  Under
    one replay every requested period carries a ``Decimal`` for both, so
    ``Decimal | None`` is a state the producer cannot be in -- and a template
    guarding against it is a guard against an impossible shape, which reads as
    coverage and is not.  ``interest: Decimal | None`` is what this field was
    until plan step X-g3a; it was optional because the accrual arrived as a map
    that covered only the periods an INTEREST account's layering pass produced.

    """Which CONDITIONAL rows a given visible window renders.

    Ruling R-O's visibility rule, stated ONCE for all three rows it governs: a
    conditional row is present for the whole visible window when at least one
    visible column carries a non-zero value, and shows its own figure (``$0.00``
    included) in every column of that window.  Rejected at the ruling: always-on
    (a permanently-zero row on the forward-looking windows, which are the ones
    most used) and past/current-only (an all-zero PAST window then reads as "not
    measured" rather than "nothing to explain").

    The rule lives here rather than in each template because it is the same
    rule for three rows on four different windows (the visible grid, the Plan
    tab, the mobile This Period card, and the two self-refresh partials), and a
    template that decided it per surface is how one form factor ends up
    rendering a balance its own figures cannot explain (ruling R-P).

    **It is a METHOD on the view rather than a free function in the grid's
    presentation service, and that is the deliberate half.**  The rule is a
    predicate over the view's OWN columns, so a free
    ``row_flags(columns, periods)`` would take as an argument the one thing a
    caller can get wrong -- hand it a different account's columns, or the
    window it is not about, and it answers confidently and wrongly.  That is
    the shape plan Section 8 rules a defect rather than a contract (the fold
    once TOOK the period list its visibility rule needed, and a caller passing
    a window moved a balance by ``$150,000.00``).  Asked of the view, it cannot
    be asked about anything else.  It carries no money and decides no figure --
    only whether a row the seam already computed appears -- so it is not a
    balance producer wearing a presentation hat.

    The fields are declared in the order the rows RENDER, which is the order
    the replay resolves them in (ruling R-AH): a contribution lands on its pay
    period's ``start_date`` and the day's accrual is then taken on the balance
    that day ENDS holding, so the money is contributed and then earns.

    **Each of the two remainder rows carries its OWN flag** (ruling R-DH (f)).
    They were one row and one flag until plan step S1-c.  Sharing a flag would
    have been cheaper and is wrong for the same reason the split itself is: a
    period that carries only true-ups would render a permanently-``$0.00``
    timing row beside them, which reads as "measured and zero" for a fact that
    was never in question.  R-O's rule is per ROW, so it is asked per row.

    **The "On other accounts" row takes the same rule** (plan step CC-4-1): it
    is a reconciliation row like the two remainders, present for the window
    when any visible column budgets something on another member of the
    owner's cash-flow set, and absent -- not a permanently-``$0.00`` line --
    for the owner with no card, which is why the grid of such an owner is

    The single entry the budget grid reads to project its column set.  ONE
    :func:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.assembled_fold` of the set's
    BALANCE account supplies its balance and its own subtotals:
    :func:`._cash_periods.period_view_of` regroups it into the income and
    expense subtotals and ruling R-K's remainder, and
    :func:`._asset_fold.resolve` resolves the modelled tiers over the SAME
    record for the balance, the accrual and the contribution.  Each OTHER
    member of the set (ruling ``credit_card:R-CC16``; plan step CC-4-1) is
    assembled ONCE too and contributes its rows to the subtotals through
    :func:`._cash_periods.paycheck_legs`, its intra-set far legs excluded
    (ruling ``credit_card:R-CC23``).  So

        balance[p] - balance[p-1]
            == net[p] + elsewhere[p] + period_timing[p] + book_vs_bank[p]
               + contribution[p] + accrual[p]

    is a property of the construction rather than an invariant a test polices
    across three independent producer passes (finding N-48).

    **It takes the SET as one value** (the read pass is the other): the route
    hands over what the resolver built, and a single-account reader -- the
    cross-page equality tests, the anchor surfaces, the balance baseline
    harness -- says so with :meth:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.CashFlowSet.single`,
    a legitimate set of one under which ``elsewhere`` is ``0.00`` in every
    column and the subtotals are that account's own.  It took ``(account,
    ctx)`` until plan step CC-4-1; a first cut kept that signature and grew an
    ``others=()`` tail, so the route destructured the set it held and this
    rebuilt it -- one value, two spellings across a boundary, which the
    leaf's adversarial review named.

    **The sharing is the point, and it is what plan step X-g2a built**
    (Section 4's constraint under ruling R-AA).  Reaching the replay through its
    own entry (:func:`._asset_fold.asset_period_view`) would have walked the
    account, loaded its plan and valued its rows a SECOND time -- undoing plan
    step X-c1's "one walk, one plan load, one valuation, whichever reader is
    asking" for the sake of one extra tier.

    **EVERY kind reaches the replay** (ruling R-W, plan step X-g3b) and it is the
    replay that decides what each one models: an ACCRUAL tier only for an account
    whose own parameters carry a rate, a CONTRIBUTION tier only for an INVESTMENT
    whose payroll funds it (:func:`._asset_contributions.contribution_events`
    returns ``[]`` for every other kind -- an HYSA's payroll does not fund it).
    A PLAIN account resolves neither, so its columns ARE its cash fold: the same
    statement this module's old kind gate made by branching, now made by the
    producer.

    **The account's REAL contribution feed is loaded here, and it is the whole
    INVESTMENT half** (ruling R-AJ (a)).  :func:`._asset_fold._modelled_return`
    reads the CALLER's ``investment_params`` on the INVESTMENT arm, while the
    INTEREST and APPRECIATING arms read the account's own params row --
    so passing ``ContributionInputs.absent()`` here, as this entry did until the
    cutover, would model NO return at all for the whole kind, not merely no
    contribution.  It loads through :func:`._inputs._contribution_inputs_for_account`,
    the same entry the scalar and the growth chip call, so the app keeps ONE
    definition of what an account's payroll puts in.  Cost, measured best-of-five
    with a fresh context per run on both databases: an INVESTMENT grid account
    ``2.7 -> 14.8 ms`` (the deductions query plus the raise-aware gross fetch,
    the same load ``/savings`` already pays for the same account), an
    APPRECIATING one ``2.7 -> 3.7 ms``, and the real Checking within run-to-run
    noise at ``~100 ms`` (804 rows; the walk dominates).

    **The accrual is a producer's answer, not a residual** (plan step X-c2b2,
    finding N-52).  It used to be the period-to-period delta of the PREMIUM
    between two independently computed balance maps, which meant any
    disagreement between those maps rendered as interest EARNED: measured on the
    real Money Market, folding the cash map while the accrual still seeded off
    the retired ``current_anchor_balance`` cache would have shown ``$2,007.01`` of
    interest in the current column -- the ``$2,000.00`` of settled money the
    cache never saw, relabelled (finding N-49).  Both halves now come off ONE
    resolved step list, so the row is the accrual map itself.

    **ONE income basis, and nobody chooses it** (ruling R-Q).  The live override
    map -- recomputed salary income and derived loan debits -- is built inside
    the fold over the account's own plan and returned on the result, so the
    grid's CELLS render from the same map its balance row folded.  It used to be
    an argument threaded through two walks whose ``None``-handling differed by
    kind, which is how one account could be valued on two income bases.

    Args:
        cash_flow: The owner's :class:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.CashFlowSet`.
            Its balance account is projected (any kind: the replay reads its
            parameters to decide which modelled tiers it has, and no branch
            here consults its kind); its other members' rows join the
            subtotals and their balances do not.
        ctx: The read pass's :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`.
            **Its ``reported_periods()`` is the column set** since plan step
            C2-c -- the owner's whole saved calendar, in payday order, each
            period valued off its OWN derived span rather than re-based on the
            window's left edge.  The route used to pass that set in, having
            read it out of the table with its two derived columns attached.

    Returns:
        A :class:`GridBalanceView`.

    Raises:

        PayCalendarError: The owner's paydays cannot define a calendar, which
            since plan step C2-c is reachable from every per-period seam entry

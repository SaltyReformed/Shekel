"""Balance-at-T seam -- the GRID kind-aware cash-flow view.

The budget grid is a single-account cash-flow surface (it reads the cash FOLD,
:mod:`._cash_fold`), but it is NOT always pointed at a cash account
(``resolve_grid_account`` falls back to any active account).  For a grid account
that MODELS a return -- an INTEREST-bearing HYSA / Money Market / CD / HSA, an
INVESTMENT, or an APPRECIATING asset -- the pure transaction running-balance
understates the real balance, because it ignores the return the net-worth
surfaces already credit.  This view gives such an account the modelled balance
AND the per-period modelled figures that explain the part of the balance change
the transactions do not -- so the grid's balance row still reconciles with the
rows above it.

**ONE per-period column, from ONE producer pass** (plan steps X-c2b1 / X-c2b2,
ruling R-K).  Every figure the grid renders for one pay period -- the projected
end balance, the income and expense subtotals, the two remainders ("Period
timing" and "Book vs bank"), the modelled contribution and the modelled
accrual -- is one
:class:`GridColumn`, and all but the last two come from a single
:func:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_periods.cash_period_view`: one walk, one
plan load, one valuation, grouped on the two clocks the identity binds.

    balance[p] - balance[p-1]
        == net[p] + period_timing[p] + book_vs_bank[p]
           + contribution[p] + accrual[p]

The grid used to compute those figures in three independent producer passes a
test then had to keep in step (finding N-48), against a subtotal that counted
only still-UNPAID rows while the balance counted the anchor plus the same rows
-- an identity that held only because neither side could see a settled row at
all, and that broke on 8 of 59 real period pairs (worst ``$2,505.17``) the
moment the balance became a fold (finding N-41).  Reading one row set grouped
two ways makes the identity a property of the object the template reads.

**The identity carries FOUR terms, not three** (ruling R-W as corrected at
X-g2b, measured at ruling R-AH).  A modelled asset has TWO modelled tiers, and
on the real Empower 401(k) the CONTRIBUTION is the larger of them
(``$9,624.27`` against ``$8,152.58`` over the horizon): the three-term form
breaks on 53 of 59 period pairs, worst ``$181.59`` a column, and the four-term
form on none.  So the seam carries both tiers apart -- they answer different
questions, what the market did and what the user put in
(:func:`._asset_fold.asset_growth_at`) -- and the grid renders them as two rows
rather than one sum, which could otherwise report a gain on an account that lost
money.

**THERE IS NO KIND GATE, and its deletion is what plan step X-g3b was**
(ruling R-W, closing finding N-76).  Every account -- PLAIN, INTEREST,
INVESTMENT, APPRECIATING, and a loan the resolver cannot configure -- reaches
:func:`._asset_fold.resolve`, which is resolved over the very
:class:`~app.services.balance_at._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold` this view regroups
into its cash columns (ONE walk, one plan load, one valuation).  The replay
decides what it decides: an account whose parameters model no return has no
ACCRUAL tier and one whose payroll does not fund it has no CONTRIBUTION tier, so
its columns ARE its cash fold.  A gate here would be a second statement of that
decision -- the shape plan Section 8 rules a defect -- and it was one: it read
``accrual_params(account) is None`` and so admitted exactly the INTEREST kind,
leaving an INVESTMENT or an APPRECIATING asset on the kind-blind cash basis
here while ``/savings`` answered it modelled.  Measured before the cutover, at
the last projected period on BOTH databases: the Empower 401(k) rendered
``$31,070.06`` here against ``$48,846.91`` there, with nothing on screen
explaining the gap.  (Ruling R-W recorded ``$48,712.19`` for the same figure on
2026-07-26; the ``$134.72`` between them is NOT explained here, because it was
not measured -- one day of this account's accrual is nearer ``$10``.  The
figure above is the one this cutover moved, re-measured on the day it shipped.)
The grid's balance now equals ``balance_map``'s on **900 of 900** (account,
period) pairs across both databases, which is the unification stated as a
property rather than as an aspiration.

**The cost this moved, stated per RENDER rather than per call.**  A modelled
grid account's column set now costs its contribution load -- an
investment-params query, a deductions query and a raise-aware gross fetch, the
same load ``/savings`` already pays for the same account -- measured
best-of-five on both databases at ``2.7 -> 14.8 ms`` for an INVESTMENT and
``2.7 -> 3.7 ms`` for an APPRECIATING asset, with PLAIN and INTEREST inside
run-to-run noise.  It is paid by EVERY grid render entry, including
``subtotal_rows``, which reads only ``income`` / ``expense`` / ``net`` off the
result; and the gross fetch loads the pay-period calendar a THIRD time in a
render that has already loaded it twice (findings **N-89** and **N-92**, both
recorded and both waiting on one context memo -- finding **N-93** records what
this step added to them).

**The replay's one fail-loud is now reachable from this surface too.**  A
modelled account carrying ZERO ``AccountAnchorHistory`` rows has no honest day
to open an accrual window on, so :func:`._asset_fold._latest_assertion_day`
raises rather than inventing one -- and deleting the gate widens that from
``/savings`` to ``/grid`` for the INVESTMENT and APPRECIATING kinds (INTEREST
already reached it).  The state is unreachable in production
(``account_service.create_account`` and migration ``cfb15e782f86`` guarantee
every account an opening row) and it is deliberate where it can happen, so no
guard is added here; it is stated because the blast radius moved to the landing
page.

**A loan is the one kind this view answers on the cash basis, and it is the
replay that decides so.**  Its amortization schedule drives its real balance
(principal paydown) while its grid "transactions" are payment transfers recorded
as income -- opposite sign, different magnitude -- so no accrual row reconciles
them.  Ruling D4 refuses a loan at the RESOLVER (``resolve_grid_account`` and
``resolve_analytics_account`` both skip amortizing accounts), so this is a
degenerate safety rather than a supported view; the replay reaches it anyway and
returns the cash fold, because ``_modelled_return`` models nothing for the
AMORTIZING kind.  An AMORTIZING account with no ``LoanParams`` lands in the same
place and belongs there.

            is TOTAL, so every requested period has one.  (It was optional while

            pre-anchor period; on the real Checking account eight columns
            rendered ``--`` for periods it plainly held money in.)
        income: The period's income subtotal, cent-quantized -- every row
            ATTRIBUTED to the period, settled at its confirmed cash leg and
            still-projected at its live or entries-aware amount (ruling R-K).
        expense: The same, for expense rows (a magnitude), so the column reads
            ``income`` minus ``expense``.
        net: ``round_money(income - expense)`` -- rounded ONCE at the boundary
            rather than as the difference of two separately-rounded legs,
            because it is the figure the balance roll-forward has to reconcile
            with.
        period_timing: Ruling R-K's remainder from the ROWS, rendered as
            "Period timing": money budgeted to this period that moved in
            another (or has not moved yet), and money that moved here but is
            budgeted elsewhere.
        book_vs_bank: Ruling R-K's remainder from the ASSERTIONS, rendered as
            "Book vs bank": what each balance true-up inside the period booked
            -- the gap between what the app had recorded and what the bank
            actually showed.
        contribution: The period's modelled CONTRIBUTION -- what the account's
            payroll puts in, employee plus employer (the read-only
            "Contributions" row).  ``0.00`` for every kind but INVESTMENT, whose
            feed is the only one that exists
            (:func:`._asset_contributions.contribution_events`).
        accrual: The period's modelled RETURN -- interest, market growth or
            appreciation (the read-only accrual row, whose LABEL the route
            resolves per kind, ruling R-AI).  ``0.00`` for an account that
            models none.

    **Neither modelled field is optional, and that is ruling R-AJ (c).**  Under
    one replay every requested period carries a ``Decimal`` for both, so
    ``Decimal | None`` is a state the producer cannot be in -- and a template
    guarding against it is a guard against an impossible shape, which reads as
    coverage and is not.  ``interest: Decimal | None`` is what this field was
    until plan step X-g3a; it was optional because the accrual arrived as a map
    that covered only the periods an INTEREST account's layering pass produced.

    Ruling R-O's visibility rule, stated ONCE for all three rows it governs: a
    conditional row is present for the whole visible window when at least one
    visible column carries a non-zero value, and shows its own figure (``$0.00``
    included) in every column of that window.  Rejected at the ruling: always-on
    (a permanently-zero row on the forward-looking windows, which are the ones
    most used) and past/current-only (an all-zero PAST window then reads as "not
    measured" rather than "nothing to explain").

    The rule lives here rather than in each template because it is the same
    rule for three rows on four different windows (the visible grid, the Plan
    tab, the mobile This Period card, and the two self-refresh partials), and a
    template that decided it per surface is how one form factor ends up
    rendering a balance its own figures cannot explain (ruling R-P).

    **It is a METHOD on the view rather than a free function in the grid's
    presentation service, and that is the deliberate half.**  The rule is a
    predicate over the view's OWN columns, so a free
    ``row_flags(columns, periods)`` would take as an argument the one thing a
    caller can get wrong -- hand it a different account's columns, or the
    window it is not about, and it answers confidently and wrongly.  That is
    the shape plan Section 8 rules a defect rather than a contract (the fold
    once TOOK the period list its visibility rule needed, and a caller passing
    a window moved a balance by ``$150,000.00``).  Asked of the view, it cannot
    be asked about anything else.  It carries no money and decides no figure --
    only whether a row the seam already computed appears -- so it is not a
    balance producer wearing a presentation hat.

    The fields are declared in the order the rows RENDER, which is the order
    the replay resolves them in (ruling R-AH): a contribution lands on its pay
    period's ``start_date`` and the day's accrual is then taken on the balance
    that day ENDS holding, so the money is contributed and then earns.

    **Each of the two remainder rows carries its OWN flag** (ruling R-DH (f)).
    They were one row and one flag until plan step S1-c.  Sharing a flag would
    have been cheaper and is wrong for the same reason the split itself is: a
    period that carries only true-ups would render a permanently-``$0.00``
    timing row beside them, which reads as "measured and zero" for a fact that
    was never in question.  R-O's rule is per ROW, so it is asked per row.

    **The sharing is the point, and it is what plan step X-g2a built**
    (Section 4's constraint under ruling R-AA).  Reaching the replay through its
    own entry (:func:`._asset_fold.asset_period_view`) would have walked the
    account, loaded its plan and valued its rows a SECOND time -- undoing plan
    step X-c1's "one walk, one plan load, one valuation, whichever reader is
    asking" for the sake of one extra tier.

    **EVERY kind reaches the replay** (ruling R-W, plan step X-g3b) and it is the
    replay that decides what each one models: an ACCRUAL tier only for an account
    whose own parameters carry a rate, a CONTRIBUTION tier only for an INVESTMENT
    whose payroll funds it (:func:`._asset_contributions.contribution_events`
    returns ``[]`` for every other kind -- an HYSA's payroll does not fund it).
    A PLAIN account resolves neither, so its columns ARE its cash fold: the same
    statement this module's old kind gate made by branching, now made by the
    producer.

    **The account's REAL contribution feed is loaded here, and it is the whole
    INVESTMENT half** (ruling R-AJ (a)).  :func:`._asset_fold._modelled_return`
    reads the CALLER's ``investment_params`` on the INVESTMENT arm, while the
    INTEREST and APPRECIATING arms read the account's own params row --
    so passing ``ContributionInputs.absent()`` here, as this entry did until the
    cutover, would model NO return at all for the whole kind, not merely no
    contribution.  It loads through :func:`._inputs._contribution_inputs_for_account`,
    the same entry the scalar and the growth chip call, so the app keeps ONE
    definition of what an account's payroll puts in.  Cost, measured best-of-five
    with a fresh context per run on both databases: an INVESTMENT grid account
    ``2.7 -> 14.8 ms`` (the deductions query plus the raise-aware gross fetch,
    the same load ``/savings`` already pays for the same account), an
    APPRECIATING one ``2.7 -> 3.7 ms``, and the real Checking within run-to-run
    noise at ``~100 ms`` (804 rows; the walk dominates).

    **The accrual is a producer's answer, not a residual** (plan step X-c2b2,
    finding N-52).  It used to be the period-to-period delta of the PREMIUM
    between two independently computed balance maps, which meant any
    disagreement between those maps rendered as interest EARNED: measured on the
    real Money Market, folding the cash map while the accrual still seeded off
    the retired ``current_anchor_balance`` cache would have shown ``$2,007.01`` of
    interest in the current column -- the ``$2,000.00`` of settled money the
    cache never saw, relabelled (finding N-49).  Both halves now come off ONE
    resolved step list, so the row is the accrual map itself.

    **ONE income basis, and nobody chooses it** (ruling R-Q).  The live override
    map -- recomputed salary income and derived loan debits -- is built inside
    the fold over the account's own plan and returned on the result, so the
    grid's CELLS render from the same map its balance row folded.  It used to be
    an argument threaded through two walks whose ``None``-handling differed by
    kind, which is how one account could be valued on two income bases.

    Args:
        account: The account to project (the grid account; any kind).  The
            replay reads its parameters to decide which modelled tiers it has;
            no branch here consults its kind.
        ctx: The read pass's :class:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext`.
            **Its ``reported_periods()`` is the column set** since plan step
            C2-c -- the owner's whole saved calendar, in payday order, each
            period valued off its OWN derived span rather than re-based on the
            window's left edge.  The route used to pass that set in, having
            read it out of the table with its two derived columns attached.

    Returns:
        A :class:`GridBalanceView`.

    Raises:
        BaselineMissingError: When ``scenario`` is None.  A ``ValueError``
            subclass; ONE application-level handler answers it (plan step
            X-v2, ruling R-BW), so no caller pre-checks.
        PayCalendarError: The owner's paydays cannot define a calendar, which
            since plan step C2-c is reachable from every per-period seam entry
            rather than only from the recurrence pages -- see
            :meth:`~app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext.calendar`, where the
            reporting domain is derived, for the one state that produces it and
            the step that removes it.

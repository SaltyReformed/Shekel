"""Balance-at-T seam -- the CASH fold regrouped into per-period COLUMNS.

Ruling R-K's half of :mod:`._cash_fold`: the same assembled fold, read a second
way.  The fold answers "what is the balance on date D" off one running total;
this module answers "what does one pay-period COLUMN say" by grouping the very
same valued rows on the BUDGET clock beside it, so the grid's balance row and
its subtotal rows reconcile by construction rather than by a test holding two
producers in step.

**Why it is its own module (plan step S1-c).**  It lived inside ``_cash_fold``
until ruling R-DH (f) split the remainder in two, at which point that module
passed the 1,000-line ceiling.  Growing past a gate is a signal, not a nuisance:
assembling a running total and regrouping it into columns are two jobs, they
share exactly one input (the :class:`~._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold`), and the
dependency runs one way -- this module imports the fold and the fold imports
nothing here.  Splitting on that seam is what the ceiling was measuring.

The identity every column satisfies, in terms of
:class:`CashPeriodFigures`::

    balance(p.end) - balance(p.start - 1 day)
        == net + period_timing + book_vs_bank

(the boundary form, so the FIRST period is covered too -- it has no predecessor
column to subtract).  A modelled account adds two more terms above this layer;
see :mod:`._grid`.

Boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md``): no Flask symbol, no writes; all money is

    The per-period output of :func:`period_view_of`, and the grid rows ruling

    kind, in terms of :attr:`balance` below::

    construction, not a coincidence: :attr:`net` sums the rows attributed to the
    period on the BUDGET clock, :attr:`period_timing` is what the same rows
    contribute on the CASH clock MINUS that budget sum, :attr:`book_vs_bank` is
    what the user's own balance assertions booked inside the period, and the
    balances are the fold of those very steps.  Verified on the prod-shape
    clone 2026-07-25 over 360 (account, period) pairs -- 6 non-loan accounts x
    60 periods -- with zero breaks.

    An INTEREST account's modelled accrual is NOT in :attr:`balance` (this is
    the kind-blind CASH-FLOW view), so a grid layering it back on adds R-K's
    remaining terms and reads ``balance[p] - balance[p-1] == net[p] +
    period_timing[p] + book_vs_bank[p] + contribution[p] + accrual[p]``.

    **The remainder is TWO figures, and that is ruling R-DH (f).**  It was one
    -- rendered "Timing & true-ups" -- and on the developer's own data it read
    ``-$4,588.69`` in a single column, of which ``-$4,161.47`` was a plug the
    engine had booked against its own double count.  Even correct it summed two
    unrelated facts: money landing in a different column from the one it was
    budgeted to, and the gap between what the app had recorded and what the
    bank actually held.  They have different causes and different fixes, so a
    user cannot act on their sum.  Split, each is a diagnostic:
    :attr:`period_timing` should read ``$0.00`` whenever every bill's money
    moves inside the period it was budgeted to, so a persistently non-zero
    value means a bill is budgeted to the wrong period or dates are being
    recorded late; :attr:`book_vs_bank` is untracked spend and should be small.

        balance: The fold's balance at the period's ``end_date``, cent-quantized
            -- assertions replayed, settled cash counted from the day it moved,
            and the still-projected plan clamped forward (ruling R-G).

            settled at its confirmed cash leg, still-projected at its live or
            entries-aware amount.  A magnitude, cent-quantized.
        expense: The same, for expense rows, so the column reads ``income``
            minus ``expense``.  **A magnitude in the ordinary case and NOT a
            bound**: an expense whose cash leg inverts contributes NEGATIVELY
            here, which :func:`_budget_legs` derives and

            pins.  A settled envelope whose refunds exceeded its purchases is a
            second way in since ruling **bank_import:R-II**; the word

            with.
        period_timing: What the two subtotal rows cannot explain about the
            balance change from the ROWS alone: money BUDGETED here that moved
            in another period (or has not moved yet), and money that MOVED here

            settled in its own column -- which is every FUTURE period, so the
            row is conditional on screen.

            period -- the difference between what the app had recorded and what
            the bank actually showed, each time they looked.  Excludes the
            OPENING assertion (see :func:`_assertion_sums`).  ``$0.00`` for a

    ONE valued row set, grouped on TWO clocks, plus the assertion steps.  The
    same walk and the same plan :func:`~._cash_fold.balances_at` folds
    are grouped here a second way -- by the pay period each row was BUDGETED to
    -- so the grid's balance row and its subtotal rows stop being two producers
    that a test has to keep in step and become two readings of one set.

    **It takes an ALREADY-assembled fold**, split from its assembly at plan step
    X-g2a so a reader that needs the cash columns AND something else off the
    same account pays for ONE walk, ONE plan load and ONE valuation rather than
    two.  The grid is that reader: from plan step X-g2b it renders the modelled
    balance -- :func:`app.services.balance_at._asset_fold.resolve` over this very
    :class:`~._cash_fold.AssembledCashFold` -- beside the budget-clock subtotals
    this returns, and calling two entry points would have assembled the account
    twice.  Taking the assembled record rather than the account is what makes
    that sharing STRUCTURAL: the columns and whatever the caller resolves beside
    them are readings of one valued row set by construction, not two producers
    that a test keeps in step.

    **The convenience twin that assembled first is GONE (plan step X-i4).**  A
    ``cash_period_view(account, basis, as_of, window)`` stood beside this and
    had no caller in ``app/`` at all -- the grid, its only production reader,
    already came through here.  It took the account and the pass's own
    derivations as independent arguments (finding **N-354**), which is the
    shape X-i4 removes, and keeping a production function alive for test callers
    alone is what ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 13 forbids.  Its callers now spell
    ``period_view_of(assembled_fold(account, ctx), window)``, where the pass
    binds the account it values.

    **Why the subtotals had to change basis, measured.**  Today's subtotal counts
    only rows that are still UNPAID (``cash_ledger.sum_projected`` filters through
    ``is_projected``), while a balance folded from the facts counts money that
    MOVED.  On the real Checking account that identity breaks on 8 of 59 period
    pairs -- worst ``$2,505.17`` -- and every past column reads ``$0.00`` income
    and ``$0.00`` expenses while thousands of dollars moved through it
    (finding N-41).  So :attr:`~CashPeriodFigures.income` /
    :attr:`~CashPeriodFigures.expense` count EVERY row attributed to the period,
    which is budget-vs-actual and fixes the ``$0.00`` past columns as a side
    effect.  Verified on the prod-shape clone 2026-07-25: the eight past columns
    go from ``$0.00`` to real figures, the current column from ``-$140.63`` to
    ``$3,153.22``, and every FUTURE column is unchanged to the cent (nothing has
    settled there, so the two bases coincide).

    **What the remainders hold, and why they are TWO rows** (ruling R-DH (f)).
    Three things the subtotal rows structurally cannot say, falling into two
    causes.  :attr:`~CashPeriodFigures.period_timing` carries the two that are
    about WHEN money moved: a row that settled outside its own pay period (19 of
    the real account's 130 settled rows; nets to ``$0.00`` across history and
    swings to ``-$2,007.46`` inside one period), and a still-projected row
    ruling R-G clamped forward out of its column.
    :attr:`~CashPeriodFigures.book_vs_bank` carries EVERY balance ASSERTION
    (the first one included since plan step X-f3c-2a, where the opening used to
    be held back because the fold had swallowed its correction into the seed)
    (``-$2,906.31`` net over the 51 that follow the opening on the real
    account, measured 2026-08-01), which are about what the app did not know.
    Rejected at the ruling: leaving the subtotals
    unpaid-only, which turns the remainder into a garbage bucket holding all
    real past activity; shipping no remainder at all, which leaves a visible
    contradiction on the screen; and summing the two, which is what shipped
    until 2026-08-01 and produced a figure with no action attached to it.

    **The OPENING EQUITY is in neither, and since plan step X-f3c-2a the reason
    is structural rather than an exclusion.**  What an account held before its
    records begin is the fold's SEED -- a stored
    ``budget.account_openings`` fact, not a correction -- so it is part of the
    level every period is measured from and steps no period's balance.  The
    first ASSERTION does appear here like any other, because it is now an
    ordinary correction: ``0.00`` where the owner's declaration agrees with the
    books, and a real movement where it does not.

    Kind-blind, exactly as the fold is (ruling R-J): this is the CASH-FLOW view,
    whose balance has to reconcile with the transaction rows rendered beside it.

    The remainders are computed HERE and directly -- ``what moved in the column``
    minus ``what was budgeted to it``, and the assertions -- rather than as the
    leftover of the fold's balance change.  That distinction is the step's whole
    verification standard: a remainder defined as ``balance_delta - net`` makes
    the identity arithmetically true and therefore untestable, and it would
    silently ABSORB a row the budget grouping got wrong.  Computed from the row
    set, the identity is a claim the fold can falsify (Section 7.2).

    **The two remainders are rounded separately, and their sum is still exact**
    (ruling R-DH (f)).  Every leg reaching this point is already cent-quantized
    (stored ``Numeric(12,2)`` columns, and both live-override seams return
    ``round_money``), so each ``round_money`` is a no-op on real data and
    ``round(a) + round(b) == round(a + b)`` holds rather than being assumed --
    which is what lets the identity hold on the DISPLAYED figures, not merely on
    the raw ones, now that the row a user reads is two rows.

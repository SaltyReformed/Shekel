"""Balance-at-T seam -- a loan's RICH figures, with the balance deliberately absent.

The seam's fourth shape.  A loan tile wants more than a balance: the monthly
payment, the current rate, the payoff date, and whether the loan is retired.
Those are rich projection detail, not a balance-at-T, and the seam has always
been happy for a consumer to hold them.

What it must NOT hand out is the BALANCE.  ``LoanState.current_balance`` was a
balance-at-today, and the W9906 fence binds on function NAMES -- it cannot see
an attribute read.  So for as long as consumers held a ``LoanState``, the loan's
displayed balance reached the screen without passing the seam: the /savings loan
tile, the net-worth hero that reduces over it, the debt card, the Horizon's
index-0 liability point, and the property-equity card's mortgage leg were ALL
produced outside the one tested place, and the fence was structurally incapable
of noticing.  They agreed with the seam only because both paths happened to
bottom out in the same genesis ledger -- agreement by luck, not by construction,
which is the exact failure signature of the whole balance-bug family
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/``).  Plan step D2a deleted that field
outright -- the bundle now carries NO balance for any holder to leak -- and the
retired predicates below fold the loan's recorded events instead.

:class:`LoanFigures` closes that by CONSTRUCTION rather than by policing: it
carries no balance, so a consumer holding one cannot render a wrong balance even
by accident.  A consumer that wants a loan's balance has exactly one way to get
it -- :func:`~app.services.balance_at.balance_at` -- which is the point.  This is
the same "do not hand ``current_balance`` to out-of-cluster callers" move that
:func:`~app.services.balance_at.debt_schedule_rows` makes for the
``DebtSchedule`` bundle (``followup_debt_schedule_attribute_fence.md``).

``is_paid_off`` lives here, not in a consumer, for the same reason: it is a
LEDGER-derived predicate over the loan's confirmed balance, so it belongs beside
the balance rules rather than in a dashboard module that would have to reach for
the balance to compute it.

class LoanTerms:
    """A loan's CONTRACT facts -- everything derivable without a scenario.

    The scenario-INDEPENDENT half of what a loan surface reads.  Every field here
    comes from the loan's params and its rate history evaluated at the pass's
    ``as_of``: no projected payment, no ledger walk, no baseline scenario.

    **Why this is its own type (plan step C8e).**  :class:`LoanFigures` used to
    carry these four fields alongside the scenario-scoped ones, and that mixture
    was invisible while every field happened to be scenario-independent.  Step C8d
    added the first scenario-scoped field (the DERIVED ``payoff_date``, which folds
    the loan's projected payments), and the mismatch surfaced immediately as an
    outage: the escrow editor, the rate-history swap, and the recurring-payment
    amount read ONLY ``monthly_payment`` / ``current_rate``, never a balance, yet
    they began raising the seam's ``require_scenario`` for a user with no baseline
    -- a state ``baseline_service`` exists to repair, and one a loan can outlive
    ("a loan configured while the baseline was gone").

    Splitting the two along the dependency they actually have is what fixes that at
    the root: a consumer takes the narrower value when the narrower value is what it
    needs, so fail-loud stays exactly where a scenario is genuinely required and
    nothing degrades into a guessed answer.  No balance here either, for the same
    reason :class:`LoanFigures` carries none.

    Attributes:
        monthly_payment: The loan's P&I payment as of the context's ``as_of``
            (the governing rate period's level payment).
        current_rate: The annual interest rate in effect on ``as_of``, as a
            decimal fraction -- the resolver-derived source of truth that
            replaced the retired ``LoanParams.interest_rate`` column.
        is_originated: Whether the loan EXISTS yet -- whether its
            ``origination_date`` has arrived by the read pass's ``as_of``.

            The seam publishes this because ``balance_at`` correctly answers
            ``$0.00`` for a loan that has not been borrowed yet, and a consumer
            that reads a zero balance as "this debt is gone" then reports the
            opposite of the truth.  Three did: the dashboard's debt track counted
            an unclosed mortgage's whole principal as REPAID (66.67% paid, on a
            borrower who had paid nothing), the property equity chart dropped a
            mortgage closing in 26 days and drew ten years of debt-free equity, and
            the year-end panel reported -$198,049.28 of principal "paid".  A zero
            balance means "owes nothing"; it does NOT mean "has no debt ahead of
            it", and only this flag separates the two.
        is_arm: Whether the loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage
            (``LoanParams.is_arm``).  Projection detail, not a balance: it tells
            /debt-strategy to caption its projection as rate-assumption-bound (the
            strategy holds the CURRENT rate fixed and does not re-apply future ARM
            adjustments).  It is here so that consumer no longer needs the whole
            ``ResolvedLoan`` -- it reached for ``resolved_loan(account, ctx).params``
            to read this ONE boolean, and a route holding a ``ResolvedLoan`` is a
            route one attribute read away from an unfenced loan balance.

    """A loan's SCENARIO-SCOPED figures -- deliberately WITHOUT its balance.

    Every field is projection detail a loan tile renders beside the balance; the
    balance itself is not here, and its absence is the point (see the module
    docstring).

    **It COMPOSES :class:`LoanTerms` rather than re-declaring its fields** (plan
    step C8e).  Everything here needs the pass's baseline SCENARIO -- the payoff
    folds the loan's projected payments, the retired predicates read its
    scenario-scoped ledger walk -- while a loan's contract terms need none, so the
    two are separate values and a consumer takes the one it actually needs.
    Composing rather than copying is the same ruling
    :class:`~app.services.savings_dashboard_service._types._LoanAccountResult`
    carries: it used to copy these fields, and the copy "silently went stale the
    moment the seam grew ``is_originated``" -- a bundle hand-synchronised with the
    one it mirrors is the seam's fence with a hole in it.

    Attributes:
        terms: The loan's scenario-independent :class:`LoanTerms` (payment, rate,
            originated, ARM).  Read through here so there is ONE derivation of
            them, whichever value a consumer holds.
        payoff_date: The DERIVED payoff -- the date the loan's balance folds to
            zero (:func:`~app.services.balance_at.loan_payoff_date`, plan step
            C8), read off the pass's memo so every surface that shows a payoff
            shows the one the BALANCE reaches zero on.

            It used to be ``LoanState.payoff_date``: the last row of the
            resolver's committed schedule walk, which amortizes one contractual
            installment per month whether or not a payment stands behind it, and
            which forces a final row at the contractual date for a loan paying
            short (``is_last_month``) -- a phantom payment.  So the chip could
            disagree with the equity chart and the balance beside it about when
            the debt ends.  Now the payoff IS the balance reaching zero, from the
            same seed and the same plan :func:`~app.services.balance_at.positions`
            folds, and they cannot disagree.

            ``None`` in two cases the consumer must tell apart, and
            :attr:`is_retired` is what tells them apart: the loan is already
            RETIRED (no forward crossing left to date -- badge it), or it never
            pays off within its plan (negative amortization, or an underpayment
            too severe to clear the post-contractual extension -- say so; do not
            hide the chip).
        is_retired: Whether the loan is DONE -- it has ORIGINATED and the fold
            of its recorded events answers ``<= 0``.  It has no debt line left:
            no balance now, and nothing scheduled ahead.

            THE single definition of "this loan has no debt to draw", which the
            property equity chart drops on.  A loan that has NOT been borrowed yet
            also owes ``$0.00`` and is emphatically not retired -- its whole debt
            line is ahead of it -- which is what the origination half of this test
            separates, and what kept a mortgage closing in 26 days on the chart.
        is_paid_off: Whether the loan is retired AND the ledger can show at least
            one confirmed payment for it.  **Strictly narrower than
            :attr:`is_retired`, and built on it, so the two cannot drift.**

            The extra confirmed-payment guard is a BADGING rule, not a debt rule:
            it keeps a brand-new loan with a degenerate ``$0`` opening anchor -- a
            misconfiguration, not an achievement -- from being badged "paid off" on
            the /savings tile and dropped from the debt card.

            Use :attr:`is_retired` to decide whether a loan has a debt line; use
            this to decide whether to CONGRATULATE the user.  Collapsing the two
            was measured: a mortgage paid off by a lump sum recorded as a balance
            true-up (no payment rows) reads ``is_paid_off=False``, so the equity
            chart charted it -- and since a zero-balance loan has an EMPTY
            schedule, the back-projection clip admitted its whole 360-row
            contractual walk and drew **$197,049.32** of debt the borrower does not
            owe, on the same page as an equity hero reporting ``$0.00``.

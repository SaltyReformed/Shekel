"""
Shekel Budget App -- No books move or definition edit strands an unpaid recurring row

Plan step ``pay_calendar:C18-a``.  A recurring definition's occurrences start
above the books of every account it moves money in (ruling **R-PC85**), and
the walk names no occurrence whose row would land on or before them
(``recurrence._placement._lands_inside_the_books``).  A row the rule has
already generated and the owner has not settled -- an unpaid, still-Projected
bill or envelope -- is therefore STRANDED by any save that makes the books
drop the occurrence it answers: the rule stops naming it, and the maintain
pass retires a row its rule no longer names (plan step R10-a) whenever a pass
reaches that row's paycheck -- the save's own regeneration for a paycheck
ending on or after the edit's effective date (today unless the owner types an
earlier one), a later pass for an older one.  A row holding the owner's
records is retained with a notice instead; a record-free one is deleted and
the forecast rises by its amount without a word.  The owner decides instead --
marked paid it becomes a movement, cancelled it holds nothing -- and the doors
refuse the save until they have:

* the opening restatement, moving an account's books LATER (ruling
  **R-PC88**; ``opening_service._reject_books_open_on_or_after_planned_rows``);
* a recurring definition's edit, whatever field it changes (rulings
  **R-PC90** -- an account move -- and **R-PC91**, which widened it to any
  save, an envelope box unticked or (until recurrence:R5-a) a due day cleared):
  :func:`definition_edit_refusal`, asked by the transaction- and
  transfer-template edit routes AFTER the edit is applied, so it reads the
  state the save would leave.

**A row the books already hold may not become unpaid again** (ruling
**R-PC97**, developer 2026-09-23, the round-4 review's H2): a paid, received,
credited or cancelled row set back to Projected, which the database's books
boundary cannot see (its movement trigger watches a row only while it
carries a settle day, and a revert clears it).  Measured: a cancelled row
reverted onto its books day took $10.00 off the forecast (-90.00 ->
-100.00).  Round 9's door census found this and the conflict chooser (below)
as the doors left for a recurring row -- a census, not an argument, so a new
writer is not covered by it.  :func:`reject_revert_below_the_books` asks the
two questions the doors above ask, and each row type's one status door
refuses a revert it answers (``status_seam.apply_status_change``,
``transfer_service.apply_status_to_all_three``).  **A stopgap by design**:
plan step ``recurrence:R22`` designs the model under which no unpaid copy is
stored, so a revert only deletes a record and there is nothing to refuse.

**An ARCHIVED definition's hidden rows count** (ruling **R-PC93**, developer
2026-09-23; the round-2 review's H-B: a books move made while it was
archived saw nothing to strand, and the unarchive then restored rows inside
the opening).  Both doors count the rows its unarchive would restore as it
STANDS, before the save being graded
(:class:`~app.services.definition_unarchive.UnarchiveScope`, the scope the
unarchive routes restore by), and name such a row as the archived
definition's, with the remedy that reaches it.  The unarchive leaves
deleted, and names, a row the books already drop or hold (ruling
**R-PC95**), so the refusal names none it would not restore -- save where
the rule cannot be walked, and every hidden row is counted.  **Not covered**: an
unarchive still restores a row deleted by hand ABOVE the books, and the
conflict chooser's "use the template" un-deletes one without asking the walk
(ledger rows **REC-536** and **REC-535**, closed by plan step
``recurrence:R22``); a rule-less row, hand-added or left by a cleared rule,
is bounded by the books at no door but the unarchive (ledger row **PC-519**).

**Two questions per planned row, and either one refuses** (ruling **R-PC99**,
developer 2026-09-23, the round-6 review's H1).

*Does its schedule drop it?*  The WALK decides, never a stored day (this
step's first review, H1): :func:`~app.services.definition_unarchive
.books_reading` names the occurrences the books drop from the walk the save
would leave, and a row is matched to its occurrence by ``occurs_on``, the
key the maintain pass matches by, so a door refuses exactly the rows the
pass would stop naming.
Reading a row's STORED due day instead let a save through that strands one:
the regeneration re-dates every still-named row by the NEW rule, so funding a
bill from the paycheck containing its date moves its cash day back onto its
scheduled day, inside the books, while the stored day still read as outside
them.  The day a refusal names is the walk's for the placement
(:meth:`~app.services.recurrence.ResolvedRecurrence.books_day`: the due day
for a bill, ruling **R-PC86**; the paycheck's last day for an envelope,
ruling **R-PC89**) -- the row as the save would leave it, which is the
wording the developer ruled for R-PC91's message.  The books are its
DEFINITION's, since those are what its walk is bounded by.

*Do the books of the account it SITS ON hold its own day?*
(:func:`~app.services.definition_unarchive.own_day_held`.)  The balance
counts a row on the account it sits on, on its stored day, so a
still-Projected row on or before that account's opening is counted a second
time whether or not its walk still names it.  Ruling **R-PC98** (the round-5
review's H2) asked it first of an ORPHAN, a row the walk names nowhere --
left behind by a rule edit, its start moved later, say -- which no dropped
occurrence catches; R-PC99 asks it of every planned row, against the books
of the account it sits on rather than its definition's: a definition's
account move leaves the rows of paychecks that had already ended on the
account it left, and that account's restatement past them committed with
``-$100.00`` in the forecast where the books rule gives ``-$80.00``
(measured, orphans and named rows alike).  Every door asks it -- an edit
door of each row as the save LEAVES it, its regeneration applied (the
round-7 review's M1) -- and the refusal names the books it asked of: a row
its schedule would drop without sitting inside the books that drop it is
refused for the pass that would delete it, never as sitting inside them.

**An OVERRIDDEN row is refused over too.**  The pass keeps a row the owner
re-priced as a conflict rather than retiring it, but the conflict chooser's
"use" hands it back to its definition, and the next pass that reaches it then
retires it like any other.  A row that answers NO occurrence (``occurs_on``
``NULL``) is asked neither question here: no walk names it with or without
the books, and ruling **R-PC96** judges it at the unarchive alone, leaving
the books move allowed (finding REC-516 retains it either way).

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): plain data and ORM
reads in, a row or a sentence out; no Flask symbol, no writes, no clock.

    (``state_machine.finalised_edit_rejection``) -- are editable only after

    **A stopgap by design**: plan step
    ``recurrence:R22`` designs the model in which no unpaid copy is stored,

    with no walk there is no telling whether the books drop the row, and the

        including a definition with no rule, whose rows no walk names, and an
        owner with no pay periods, who has no rows.

Shekel Budget App -- Status Seam: the MECHANICS

:func:`apply_status_change` -- the ONE place a ``Transaction.status_id`` or a
``Transfer.status_id`` may be assigned -- and the two readings that grade what a
FORM submission means for the status it carries.

**This leaf is what the ``shekel-transaction-status-bypass`` fence allowlists**,
and the narrowing is the point rather than a tidy-up.  The entry read
``app.services.status_seam`` while that was one module; :func:`._common._module_in_allowlist`
matches a package PREFIX, so the split would have extended the exemption over
every leaf here without anybody deciding it should be.  That is precisely what
happened to ``transfer_service`` at plan step X-f2-c3, and its ``_status``
docstring records it.  Only this module writes ``status_id``; the record leaf
and the refusals leaf write nothing at all.

Split out of the single ``status_seam`` module at plan step **X-au-c3**; see
:mod:`._record` for the ground the split was made on.

Mutates the passed row in place; does NOT flush or commit -- the caller owns the
session boundary.  No Flask imports.

    """Return the settle day a FORM submission means, and refuse an impossible one.

    **The edit doors' half of the settled-iff-dated invariant, stated once**
    (plan step X-f1c, ruling **R-EG**).  Both full-edit forms submit the row's
    whole state on Save, and the documented way to unlock a finalised row is to
    set Status to Projected in that same form -- so a revert arrives as
    ``{status_id: Projected, settled_on: <the day the row already carried>}``.
    That day is a stale ECHO of the state being left, not an assertion that
    money moved: the user picked Projected, which says it did not.  The seam's
    own :func:`reject_settle_day_without_settled_status` refuses that pair with
    a 400 -- correctly, for a SERVICE caller, which is asserting both facts on
    purpose -- and applying that refusal to a form submission would make the
    only documented unlock path fail on every settled row.

    So the rule is: **a day counts only when the row is moving INTO (or staying
    in) the settled band.**  Anywhere else it is dropped and the seam clears the
    column, which is what a revert means.

    It lives here, beside the refusal it defers to, rather than in either route:
    the transaction PATCH and the transfer PATCH are two doors onto ONE rule,
    and two spellings of it is this arc's own root cause 1.  It does NOT weaken
    the service guard -- the seam still refuses a day handed to it for an
    unsettled status, so a programmatic caller that means it still fails loud.

    **It also enforces the FLOOR (ruling R-EL), and the floor is a DOOR rule
    rather than a seam invariant -- which is the whole reason it is here and not
    in** :func:`apply_status_change`.  :func:`reject_future_settle_day` refuses a
    day in the future from ANY caller, because no caller can legitimately record
    money that has not moved.  The other end is not like that.  A day at or
    before an assertion is ABSORBED into it by ``cash_ledger._walk``, which then
    resets the running total to the asserted balance -- and for a GENUINE
    pre-schedule settle that is CORRECT (ruling R-EB: an assertion reconciles, so
    anything before it is already inside the asserted balance).  Recording money
    that moved before you started budgeting is a real thing to do, and a bank
    import would do it in bulk.  **What is never legitimate is a HUMAN typing a
    year wrong**, so the bound belongs where a human types.

    Measured: enforcing it at the seam instead refused **six** existing tests
    whose scenario is a payment budgeted to a 2026 pay period whose cash moved in
    December 2025 -- the year-boundary attribution rule, and exactly the shape an
    import produces.  Enforcing it here refuses none of them, because they call
    the service.

    ``fields.Date()`` deserializes ``"0202-08-04"`` to a real ``date``, so the
    typo is an ordinary slip in a box whose own tooltip invites correction.
    Worked on a ``$1,000`` anchor observed three days ago with a ``$100`` settled
    expense: the grid reads ``$900``, and after the typo ``$1,000``, with the
    ``$100`` becoming an unexplained plug at the next anchor re-derive -- the row
    still reading Paid throughout.  The bound is
    :func:`app.services.pay_period_service.earliest_recordable_day`, the SAME
    floor an anchor's ``observed_on`` has used since finding **N-133**, and both
    settle-day inputs carry it as ``min``.

    **Only a FORWARDED day is bounded.**  A day dropped beside a revert writes
    nothing, so refusing it would break the unlock path R-EG exists to keep open.

    Args:
        user_id: The row owner, whose pay-period schedule sets the floor.
        new_status_id: The ``ref.statuses.id`` the row is moving to -- the
            SUBMITTED status when the form carried one, else the row's current
            one (an edit that changes only the day is an identity transition).
        submitted_day: The civil day the form submitted, or ``None`` when it
            submitted none.  An empty date input loads as absent rather than as
            an explicit ``None`` (the field is not ``allow_none``), because a
            settled row always carries a day: the way to remove one is to leave
            the settled band, which clears it.
        recorded: What the row ALREADY records
            (:func:`app.services.settle_day.recorded_settle_day`), or ``None``
            when it records no day.  **It is what makes this function
            ECHO-AWARE**, which is exactly why :func:`figure_for_status` takes
            the row beside it: without the stored value a door cannot tell an
            untouched prefill from a day the user just retyped, and both
            popovers prefill the control.  Defaulting to ``None`` treats every
            submission as a fresh assertion, which is the SAFE direction for a
            caller that genuinely has no stored pair -- a row settling for the
            first time -- and the wrong one for a re-save, which is why all
            three route doors pass it.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~app.services.settle_day.SettleDay` on the ``entered`` basis
        wrapping *submitted_day* when *new_status_id* is settled -- which is
        ``None`` itself when the form submitted none, and that is the same
        answer the unsettled branch gives; ``None`` otherwise.  The seam reads
        ``None`` as "derive the day from the status", i.e. preserve on a
        re-settle and clear on a revert.

        **The basis is ``entered`` for a day that MOVED, and *recorded*'s own
        basis for one that did not** (plan step X-az). A day that arrived in a
        date box and differs from the stored one is the owner's own record: no
        bank statement showed it and no balance assertion bounds it, which is
        exactly what :attr:`~app.enums.SettledDayBasisEnum.ENTERED` names.  A
        day EQUAL to the stored one is the control coming back untouched and
        asserts nothing, so the row's existing basis stands --
        :func:`app.services.settle_day.submitted_settle_day` is that rule, and
        it carries the ``$4,173.07`` this function cost production without it.
        Stating it there rather than at the three routes is the same argument
        that put the rest of this function here -- the transaction PATCH, the
        transfer PATCH and the entry PATCH are doors onto ONE rule.

    Raises:
        ValidationError: When the day would be FORWARDED and precedes the
            owner's earliest recordable day (ruling R-EL).  A 400: it is
            ordinary user input from the correction box.

    Note:
        **The ``submitted_day is None`` arm was forbidden here until plan step
        X-az and is load-bearing now**, and the reversal is worth stating
        because the rule behind the old prohibition has not changed.  It read:
        the arm is unreachable as a DECISION -- both branches already answer
        ``None`` for a ``None`` day -- so no single-line mutation of this
        function could fail a test written against it, and a guard whose only
        possible test cannot fail is not a guard (finding **N-184**).  That was
        exact while the settled branch returned the day it was handed.  It now
        returns a :class:`~app.services.settle_day.SettleDay`, which cannot
        wrap a ``None``, so the two branches answer differently and deleting
        this line raises rather than returning the same value by another route.
        The test that fails when it goes is a settled status with no submitted
        day -- the ordinary re-settle, which must reach the seam as "derive the
        day" and not as a malformed value.

    2026-08-17; the echo term added 2026-08-18 after a neutral review measured
    what its absence cost).

    Both full-edit forms submit the row's WHOLE state on Save, so a settled row
    reverting to Projected posts the Actual box's current contents alongside
    ``status_id = Projected``.  When the box was NOT touched that figure is a
    stale ECHO of the state being left, and keeping it would make the documented
    unlock path fail on every settled row -- the trap ruling **R-EG** removed
    for the settle day.  So an echo is dropped.

    **A DIFFERENT figure beside an unsettling status is not an echo, and
    dropping it was a measured money defect.**  The first version of this rule
    read the status alone: it took no row, so it could not tell a prefill from a
    number the user had just retyped, and it discarded both.  Measured end to
    end -- a bill settled at a hand-typed ``$245.32``, re-read off the statement
    as ``$214.37``, corrected and reverted in one Save: HTTP 200, no message,
    and the row still recording ``$245.32``, which is what
    :meth:`Settlement.from_settle` then re-books.  Worse than the day's
    analogue, because a revert CLEARS the day and RETAINS the figure, so a
    silent drop there becomes a silently wrong booking here.

    Such a submission asserts two contradictory things -- "this much moved" and
    "it did not move" -- so it is REFUSED, in the sentence
    :func:`reject_figure_without_settled_status` carries, which tells the user
    to correct the figure and revert as two acts.  That refusal was unreachable
    from any HTTP door until this term existed.

    Args:
        row: The row the submission is about, for the refusal's noun.  For a

        new_status_id: The ``ref.statuses.id`` the row is moving to -- the

            none.

    The ONE place a ``Transaction.status_id`` or a ``Transfer.status_id`` may be

    the inline PATCH, ``cancel``, ``mark_as_credit`` / ``unmark_credit``, the
    envelope ``transaction_service.settle_from_entries``, and
    ``transfer_service.update_transfer``'s mirror onto a transfer and its two
    shadows -- routes through here so the status mechanics are uniform and
    impossible to skip.

    Does the status MECHANICS only, in order:

      1. ``verify_transition`` -- the state-machine legality gate, which picks
         the workflow from *row*'s own model class; raises ``ValidationError``
         on an illegal move (e.g. Cancelled -> Paid), which the route layer
         surfaces as a 400.
      2. assign ``status_id``.
      3. maintain the SETTLEMENT RECORD -- ``settled_on``,
         ``settled_day_basis_id``, ``settled_amount``, ``settled_basis_id`` and
         the clearing link -- as ONE act (see the *settle_day* and *settlement*
         args).  **Transactions only**, because
         ``Transfer`` carries none of those columns: a transfer's money moves on
         its two shadow rows, and the transfer service applies this seam to those
         shadows, so a transfer settle still records what moved and when.
      4. ``db.session.expire(row, ["status"])`` so a pre-commit reader (a cell
         render, a test assertion) sees the new ``Status`` row, not the stale
         ``lazy="joined"`` one -- the exact trap ``mark_as_credit`` documented
         and handled inline before this seam absorbed it.  Both models declare
         ``status`` as ``lazy="joined"``, so both need it; the transfer path did
         not do this before X-aj1 and held only because every route commits
         before it renders.

    It deliberately does NOT post to the ledger and does NOT flush or commit:
    ledger emission is reconciled once at the END of each handler, after every
    effect field is applied, never at the status flip (Build-Order Step 3,
    Commit 6 -- the same placement ``transfer_service.update_transfer`` uses);
    the caller owns the session boundary.

    Args:
        row: The :class:`~app.models.transaction.Transaction` or
            :class:`~app.models.transfer.Transfer` whose status changes.  Must
            be session-attached so the ``status`` expire reloads; its
            ``status_id`` is read as the current state for the transition check
            and its CLASS selects the workflow.
        new_status_id: The ``ref.statuses.id`` to move to.
        settle_day: Settle-day policy, read only for a ``Transaction``.
            ``None`` (the default) DERIVES the day from *new_status_id*: stamp
            ``display_today()`` on entering a settled status (Paid or
            Received) that has none yet, **preserve an existing one on an
            idempotent re-settle**, and clear it on entering a non-settled
            status (so a reverted / cancelled / credited row drops its stale
            settle day and the basis that described it).  A non-``None``
            :class:`~app.services.settle_day.SettleDay` is written verbatim,
            and it states BOTH the day and HOW that day is known.

            **The basis is the CALLER's to state and there is no default**
            (plan step **X-az**, finding **N-332**).  A door that knows a day
            knows where it came from: the statement matcher writes a day the
            bank POSTED (``observed``), the reconcile panel writes the day a
            BALANCE was asserted for and so an UPPER BOUND (``asserted``), and
            an edit box writes the owner's own (``entered``).  ``settled_on``
            carried all three with nothing saying which, and the matcher told
            the panel's apart by testing whether ``reconciled_by_id`` was
            populated -- exact over those three writers, blind to the third of
            them, and one new writer from wrong.  Packaging the day WITH its
            basis is what leaves no default to get wrong: a caller cannot pass
            a day without saying what kind it is.

            **A day supplied for a NON-settled status is REFUSED**
            (:func:`reject_settle_day_without_settled_status`, finding
            **N-183**), which is what makes "a row is settled if and only if it
            carries a settle day" a property of this function rather than a
            convention its callers keep.

            **The day is the USER's, not the server's** (ruling R-DH (b)).
            ``display_today()`` reads the display timezone, where
            ``date.today()`` would read the process's UTC day and file an
            8pm-Eastern settle under tomorrow.  This is also why the seam no
            longer assigns ``db.func.now()``: that reached PostgreSQL's clock,
            one of the four database-clock reaches finding N-65 had to build
            ``_freeze_db_clock`` to contain, and a Python ``date`` is a value
            the suite's own clock freeze already governs.

            **The preserving rule is load-bearing and is finding N-146's fix.**
            The transfer service's deleted seam re-stamped every entry into a
            settled status including an identity re-submit, and since plan step
            E1a a settle's civil day IS the ``entry_date`` its postings are
            filed under -- so editing the notes on a paid transfer moved its
            money to today.  **Finding N-178 then showed the seam alone is not
            enough**: both mark-done routes passed an explicit instant, which
            overrode this rule, and a replayed POST re-dated a settled transfer
            by however long ago it really settled.  Neither route passes one
            now, so the preserve rule is the only rule.

            **A RE-SETTLE is a RE-ENTRY, not a first entry**, and that is why
            preservation matters beyond the edit forms: re-submitting a row's
            own settled status -- which the full-edit popover does on every
            Save, since it posts the whole row and not a delta -- must not move
            its money to the day the form was saved.

            The sharpest case used to be ``Paid -> Settled``, the ARCHIVE: it
            was a genuine STATUS CHANGE that still had to preserve the day.
            Plan step **X-am** deleted that status, so every within-band move
            left is the identity one, and preservation is what makes an
            untouched Save a no-op instead of a re-dating.

        settlement: WHAT moved, when this change RECORDS a settle
            (:class:`Settlement`).  Written to ``settled_amount`` and
            ``settled_basis_id`` in the same act as the day above, so one call
            states everything a settle knows.  The figure and its basis are
            paired by ``ck_transactions_settled_amount_needs_basis``; the settle
            DAY is deliberately not paired with either, because a revert
            withdraws the day and keeps what moved.

            **A row ENTERING the settled band must supply one**, and that
            refusal is what makes "a settled row states what moved" a property of
            this function rather than a convention its callers keep.  Before plan
            step X-au-c3 a settle recorded a figure only when a human had typed a
            correction, so most settled rows recorded nothing and every reader
            fell back to the row's PLAN -- and because a plan is a derivation,
            the plan then had to be FROZEN at settle so a later price change
            could not move a figure the bank had already taken.  A mandatory
            record is what leaves nothing to freeze.

            ``None`` leaves whatever the row already records untouched -- which
            is what an identity re-submit, a settle-day correction, an archive
            and a REVERT each mean.  A revert releases the ASSERTION
            (``settled_on``, ``settled_day_basis_id`` and ``reconciled_by_id``,
            above) and keeps what moved, because the two are different facts
            with different lifetimes; the comment at that assignment carries the
            argument.

Shekel Budget App -- Status Seam

The single status-mechanics primitive for BOTH status-bearing rows.
``apply_status_change`` is the ONE place a ``Transaction.status_id`` or a
``Transfer.status_id`` is assigned.  Every status-changing path -- the manual
``mark_done`` branch, the inline PATCH, ``cancel``, ``mark_as_credit`` /
``unmark_credit``, the envelope ``settle_from_entries``, and the transfer
service's mirror onto a transfer and its two shadow rows -- routes through it so
the status mechanics are uniform and impossible to skip.

**It became the only seam at plan step X-aj1** (ruling **R-DN**,
``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``).  ``transfer_service`` used to
carry a SECOND implementation of this same seam for a transfer's rows, and that
duplication is why the ``shekel-transaction-status-bypass`` checker (W9907)
needed a two-module allowlist at all.  **Merging the seams does not by itself
shrink that allowlist**, and saying so here matters because the obvious
inference is wrong: ``transfer_service`` still writes a status through two
CONSTRUCTORS (``_build_shadow`` and ``create_transfer``), which W9907's
born-Projected rule refuses, so its entry survives until plan step X-aj2 replaces
the write door.  What the merge did remove is the duplicate ATTRIBUTE writes --
and three defects the duplicate had and this one did not:

* it stamped the settle instant UNCONDITIONALLY on entering a settled status
  rather than preserving an existing one, so an identity re-submit of an
  unchanged status re-dated a settled transfer -- and since plan step E1a that
  day IS the posted ``entry_date``, so it moved the money (finding **N-146**).
  **The seam alone did not close that class**: plan step X-f1b0 found both
  mark-done routes passing an explicit instant that overrode this seam's
  preservation, re-dating a replayed settle by however long ago it happened
  (finding **N-178**), and removed both;
* it never expired the ``status`` relationship, though both models declare it
  ``lazy="joined"`` -- latent rather than live, since every route commits before
  rendering, but true by accident rather than by construction;
* it mirrored a drifted shadow's status with no transition check at all, which
  ruling **R-DO** replaced with a refusal.

**It is a PACKAGE since plan step X-au-c3, and the leaves are the three
subjects**: :mod:`._seam` (the mechanics -- ``apply_status_change`` and the two
form-submission readings), :mod:`._record` (WHAT a settle records: the
``Settlement`` value and the reads over it), and :mod:`._refusals` (the
invariants stated as guards).  The split is the one ``transfer_service`` and
``cash_ledger`` already made at the same 1000-line ceiling, and by the same
rule: BY RESPONSIBILITY, not by line count.  **The public surface is this module
and ``__all__`` is it** -- a leaf is private, and a caller outside the package
depends on the names below, so no import site changed when the split landed.

**The W9907 allowlist narrowed WITH the split**, to ``_seam`` alone.  Prefix
matching would otherwise have exempted every leaf here from the status-write
fence without anybody deciding it should be -- the exact widening that happened
to ``transfer_service`` at plan step X-f2-c3.  Neither of the other two leaves
writes ``status_id`` at all.

Architecture:
  - A LOW-LEVEL primitive: it depends only on the state machine, the
    settled-status predicate, the session, and the models -- never on the
    higher-level services that call it (``transaction_service``,
    ``credit_workflow``, ``transfer_service``, the route layer, and the loan /
    paycheck settle paths).  Living below its callers is what keeps it free of
    the ``transaction_service <- entry_service <- entry_credit_workflow <-
    credit_workflow`` import cycle: were the seam in ``transaction_service``
    (which imports ``entry_service``), ``credit_workflow`` could not import it
    without closing that cycle.
  - **It also owns the DOOR-SIDE reading of a submitted settle day**
    (:func:`settle_day_for_status`, plan step X-f1c / ruling R-EG), which is
    form-submission policy rather than a primitive.  It lives here anyway, and
    the narrower "primitive only" claim this paragraph used to make alone was
    corrected by a neutral review: the rule has THREE route doors (the
    transaction PATCH, the transfer PATCH, and the transaction PATCH's
    shadow branch) spread over two route packages, so the alternatives were a
    shared route helper -- a cross-package private import, which W9910 fences --
    or three spellings of one rule, which is this arc's own root cause 1.  It
    sits beside the refusal it defers to
    (:func:`reject_settle_day_without_settled_status`) so the forgiving door
    rule and the fail-loud service rule are read together.
  - The dependency claim above is unchanged by that: the function is pure, and
    reads only the settled-status predicate.
  - No Flask imports.  Mutates the passed row in place; does NOT flush or
    commit -- the caller owns the session boundary.

Shekel Budget App -- Status Seam: the refusals

The invariants of a settlement stated as GUARDS, so every caller of the seam
inherits them rather than each door remembering one.  They are gathered here
because they are one subject -- what a row may and may not assert about its own
money -- and because :func:`._seam.apply_status_change` runs five of them
ahead of any mutation, so a refused call leaves the row untouched; the two
form readings beside it (``figure_for_status``, ``tender_for_status``) run
the other two for the edit doors, ahead of the seam.

Split out of the single ``status_seam`` module at plan step **X-au-c3**; see
:mod:`._record` for the ground the split was made on.

Five of the seven are this project's answer to a rule that cannot be a CHECK
constraint, and each says so in its own docstring: the settled-status
questions need ``ref.statuses.is_settled``, which a constraint on
``budget.transactions`` cannot see, and the ref convention keeps status ids out
of a schema; the stated-figure-over-purchases question is a count over
another table (:func:`reject_stated_figure_over_purchases`).  One is the
WORDS of a trigger: :func:`reject_settlement_on_a_deleted_row` says what
:mod:`app.deleted_row_infrastructure` refuses.  (An eighth,
``reject_settle_day_without_a_record``, was the one that MIRRORED a CHECK --
``ck_transactions_settle_day_needs_a_record`` said in words -- and went with
that CHECK and the row's figure columns at plan step ``balance:X-bi-4b-2``.)

Pure: reads columns and the settled-status predicate, raises or returns.  No
session, no mutation, no Flask.

    """Refuse a settle day supplied for a status that is not settled.

    **One half of the settled-iff-dated invariant, stated once** (plan step
    X-f1, finding **N-183**).  A row carries the civil day its money moved if
    and only if it is in a settled status (Paid or Received), so a day
    handed in beside a Projected / Credit / Cancelled status is not a value to
    store -- it is a request to record a payment that has not happened.

    It is a module-level function rather than an inline check inside
    :func:`apply_status_change` because ONE caller has to ask the question
    BEFORE the seam can: ``transfer_service.create_transfer`` validates
    ``spec.settled_on`` against ``spec.status_id`` before any row exists, and
    for an unsettled create it never reaches the seam at all (its settle branch
    is gated on the status being settled), so the day would be silently
    dropped.  Two moments, one rule -- the alternative is the same sentence
    written twice, which is this arc's own root cause 1.

            the only way here is a service-layer mistake, for which a 400 is
            generous.  Plan step **X-f1c** is what makes it a user mistake with

            submitting a day while moving the row back to Projected becomes an
            ordinary form error.  The class is chosen for the door that is

    is a forecast in a fact column.  ``Transaction``'s class docstring specified

    ``$900``; PATCH its day forward and the route answers ``200`` with the

    the user to correct the day against their statement, and a statement's most
    common disagreement is a PENDING item carrying a FUTURE posting date.

    **The opposite rule on ``TransactionEntry.settled_on`` is not a
    contradiction.**  A future ENTRY posting day is the CONSERVATIVE direction --
    no assertion closes over it, so the debit stays reserved and the balance
    stays low -- so that door bounds only from below and says so.  A future
    ``Transaction.settled_on`` points the other way: it takes settled money OUT
    of the balance.  The two fields' rationales do not transfer.

    **The recorded clearing fact does not undo that** (plan step X-f3a-1, ruling
    **R-FL**), and an adversarial review was right to ask: a LINKED purchase is
    cleared whatever its day says, so a linked entry moved to a future day would
    release its reservation and put already-reserved money back in the
    projection -- the very failure this refusal exists to prevent, arriving
    through the exempt door.  It cannot happen, because
    ``entry_service.update_entry`` RELEASES the link whenever the posting day
    moves: a future-dated entry is therefore always unlinked, and the day rule
    answers it exactly as this paragraph describes.

    It lives here, beside :func:`reject_settle_day_without_settled_status` and
    the ``datetime`` refusal, for the reason those are here: ONE door, every

    has to remember.  Both date inputs also carry ``max`` = today, so the browser

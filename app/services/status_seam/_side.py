"""
Shekel Budget App -- Status seam: a TRANSFER SIDE'S payment record (the Transfer arm).

Plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` (rulings **R-BAL88**, **R-BAL142**).  A
transfer's money moves on its two SIDES, and each side's payment record hangs
off the TRANSFER by a side link (``transaction_entries.expense_transfer_id`` /
``income_transfer_id``), keyed with the record's account onto that side's
endpoint.  Until this step each side's record hung off a hidden twin row and
this seam wrote it through the row's arm (:mod:`._covering`), one call per
twin, with the twin's own status, day and clearing link copied onto it.  The
twins carried nothing a side needs: a transfer's status is ONE column on the
transfer, and a side's day is its record's.  So this arm writes a side's record
DIRECTLY, and the transfer writer
(``transfer_service._status.apply_status_to_all_three``) calls it once per act
for both sides, under ONE press.

**What it writes, and the row arm's rule it follows for each fact:**

* the FIGURE, who wrote it and the name -- :func:`._covering.record_figure`,
  the row arm's own figure half, with the side's leg label as the name;
* the DAY and how it is known -- the side's resolved day
  (``transfer_service._side_days``) through ``settle_day.record_settle_day``,
  so the books boundary refuses a day the account's books do not reach; a
  payment's purchase day IS its settle day (ruling **R-BAL39**), so
  ``purchased_on`` follows a day that moves;
* the STATEMENT LINK -- released whenever the day moves or the transfer
  leaves the band (ruling **R-FL**: a link records that a statement showed
  this money on that day); a day re-stated on the SAME day keeps it, and
  raises the basis by :func:`._covering.raises_basis`, never lowering a
  side's own evidence (``settle_day.is_evidence``);
* a REVERT un-dates the record and keeps it (ruling **R-BAL61**), and the next
  settle re-dates the same record;
* a close at ``$0.00`` keeps NO record on either side (rulings **R-BAL82**,
  **R-BAL141**): records a revert kept are taken off the books through the one
  removal act (:mod:`app.services.movement_removal`), both sides in ONE call
  under the save's press, so the dialog's figure and the receipt's are one
  derivation and a matched line is freed only where the page named it
  (rulings **R-CC127**, **R-CC135**).

**The transfer's optimistic-lock counter moves whenever a side's record or
day nets a change** (developer ruling 2026-08-18, the ``$214.37`` two-tab lost
update).  A record is a row of another table, so a figure or day correction
writes nothing of the transfer and its counter would stand still; both
popovers pin the transfer's ``version_id``.  ``flag_modified`` forces the
transfer into the flush, exactly as the row arm's ``_record_moved`` does for a
row.  Until this step the transfer service compared the twins' counters before
and after the act (``_update._bump_parent_version_if_a_leg_moved``), which saw
a day move only because the twin's own day column moved -- a side record's day
is its own now, and the arm that writes it is the one that knows.

**The tender is the side's endpoint**: a record's account is held to its
side's endpoint by the side key, so a transfer settle names no tender and a
new record books on the endpoint.

Services-boundary discipline (``CLAUDE.md`` Architecture): no Flask imports;
mutates in place and never commits; the removal act's posting reversal
FLUSHES, and the caller owns the session boundary.

    """Keep a transfer's two side records in step with the act its writer is applying.

    Called by the transfer writer BEFORE it writes the transfer's own status
    (``status_seam.apply_status_change``), so the transfer's ``status_id`` is
    still the status the act is LEAVING -- which is what "was settled" reads.
    Three cases, total over what the writer can ask:

    * **neither before nor after in the settled band** -- a cancel of a
      Projected transfer: nothing moves;
    * **in the band with a record** -- a settle, a re-settle after a revert, a
      figure correction or a born-settled create: each side's record carries
      the figure and its own day (a new record when the side holds none), or,
      for a ``$0.00`` figure, neither side keeps one;
    * **otherwise each side's record follows its day** -- a revert un-dates
      it, a day correction re-dates it, an identity re-submit moves nothing.

    Every refusal runs before the first write, for the seam's reason: a
    refused act leaves both records untouched.  That includes the books
    boundary: each day this act will write is graded against its side's
    endpoint here (``cash_ledger.reject_movement_before_books_open``, the
    producer ``settle_day.record_settle_day`` asks again at the write), so a
    day the second side's books do not reach is refused before the first
    side is written (the cp2a review's L1, measured: a settle naming the
    from-side's day onto a to-side whose books open later left the new
    from-side record staged when the to-side was refused).  The removal act
    a ``$0.00`` close runs refuses a line the press did not name as it
    starts, and that act is this function's only write in that case.

            side's record as it stands (``transfer_legs.transfer_side_leg``),

        new_status_id: The ``ref.statuses.id`` the transfer is moving to --
            its current one for a correction.
        days: Each side's day once the act lands, ``(expense, income)``, as
            the writer resolved them (ruling **R-BAL142**); ``(None, None)``
            out of the band.
        settlement: WHAT moved, when the act records a settle; ``None``

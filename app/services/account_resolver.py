Shekel Budget App -- Account Resolvers

Shared helpers to deterministically pick the account used by the
budget grid and the analytics services for balance and reporting
queries.

* ``resolve_grid_account`` -- 4-step fallback chain used by the
  budget grid (every step refuses an AMORTIZING account -- ruling D4
  / step A1; a loan's balance is not a transaction sum, see
  :func:`is_cash_flow_account`):

    1. override_account_id  (query param -- future URL-based override)
    2. user_settings.default_grid_account_id  (if set and still active)
    3. First active checking account  (by sort_order, id)
    4. First active grid-eligible account  (by sort_order, id)
    5. None

* ``resolve_cash_flow_set`` -- the grid resolver's answer widened to
  "checking and its cards" (ruling ``credit_card:R-CC16``, plan step
  CC-4-1): the primary grid account plus the owner's active revolving
  accounts, as one :class:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.CashFlowSet`
  whose balance line is the primary or an override within the set.
  Read by the grid, the dashboard and the spending report.

* ``resolve_analytics_cash_flow_set`` -- the SAME set for the calendar,
  which takes an explicit ``account_id`` as a question about THAT
  account: an override the admission test refuses answers ``None`` (the
  route's 404) where the grid resolver falls through to the primary.
  It replaced ``resolve_analytics_account`` at plan step CC-4-3, whose
  "first active checking, no settings layer" default was a second
  spelling of the primary; every analytics surface now reads the one
  primary the grid reads.

One admission test (``_admissible_grid_account``: the owner's, active,
a cash-flow kind) sits behind every explicit id and every saved default,
so neither resolver can hand a loan to a surface that renders a
cash-flow balance (ruling D4 / step A1; plan step X-a1 closed the
calendar door finding N-38 measured open).

    """Return True when a CASH-FLOW surface may render *account*.

    A cash-flow surface renders a balance beside the account's OWN transaction
    rows, so the two have to reconcile on screen.  This predicate gates the
    surfaces reached through the resolvers in this module: the budget
    grid, the dashboard hero and pulse, and the analytics calendar's
    end-of-day line and month-end figure.

    **What such a surface READS is no longer one answer** (plan step X-g3b).
    The dashboard and the calendar read the seam's cash entries
    (``cash_balance_map`` / ``cash_balance_at`` / ``cash_daily_balance_series``
    -- a pure running sum from the anchor); the grid reads
    ``grid_balance_view``, which renders the MODELLED balance with the accrual
    and contribution rows that explain it (ruling R-W).  Both are cash-flow
    surfaces in the sense this gate cares about, and the gate itself is
    unchanged by that split: a LOAN is refused from all of them.  The remaining
    consumer, the cash detail page, carries its own wider gate
    (``routes.accounts._cash_page.cash_detail_wrong_type``, which also
    refuses appreciating and retirement / investment kinds), so it is
    not routed through here.  An AMORTIZING loan's balance is not
    a transaction sum -- payment transfers INTO the loan read as inflows,
    so the grid rendered the real Mortgage RISING by the full PITI every
    month (plan-of-record finding B-3, ruling D4: the grid refuses an
    amortizing account; step A1).  Branches on the ``has_amortization``
    boolean column, never a type-name string, matching
    :func:`app.services.account_projection.classify_account`.

    **One predicate, both resolvers, because it is one question.**  It was
    ``is_grid_account`` and gated the grid path alone, which read as a
    grid preference rather than the kind rule it is -- and the calendar
    reached the same producers through ``resolve_analytics_account`` (its
    resolver until plan step CC-4-3) with no gate at all.  Measured on a
    dev clone 2026-07-25, before plan
    step X-a1 closed it: ``/analytics?view=month&account_id=3`` rendered
    the Mortgage at ``$178,103.41`` and ``account_id=8`` rendered the Van
    Loan at ``$531.94``, where the loans owed ``$177,277.97`` and
    ``$15,663.59`` -- finding B-3 itself, on the one cash-flow surface
    ruling D4's enumeration missed (finding N-38).

    **It lives here rather than beside the page it gates because a SECOND

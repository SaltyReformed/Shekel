"""
Shekel Budget App -- Retirement Dashboard Inputs and Resolvers

The LOADER and the resolvers behind the retirement picture: what a render
reads from the database once (:func:`load_gap_inputs`), and the single
definitions of the questions that picture asks of the user's settings --
which retirement date is planned and who owns it, what safe-withdrawal rate
applies, what estimated retirement tax rate is stored, what the pension
benefit sums to, what the owner's current paycheck is, and what the
final-year take-home comes to.

**It stopped ORCHESTRATING at plan step C2-f2d-2.**  ``compute_gap_data``
lived here and was one of the two implementations of "the retirement picture
at a candidate plan"; :mod:`app.services.retirement_plan` is now the only
one, and it composes the resolvers below.  What is left here is what that
producer -- and the lever solver, and the readiness shaping -- all read
from, which is why it is one module and not three.

All functions accept plain data (the render's read pass, loaded inputs) and
return plain data.  No Flask imports.

    The assumptions rail's counterpart to
    :func:`resolve_retirement_date_provenance`, and it exists for the same
    reason: the rail has TWO render sites -- the dashboard's include and
    ``retirement.update_settings``'s re-render after a save -- so a list
    assembled in the template would be assembled twice, in Jinja, which is
    where this project does not compute.

    **Recurring raises only**, which is :func:`recurring_raises`'s membership
    rule and is stated there; a one-time raise has no assumption to state and
    contributes no row.  **Each row is a PROBE since plan step salary:S3-f-2b**:
    the rail renders the salary form's own end-year pair (a mode and a year,
    ruling **R-SAL13**) pre-filled from the row, and every readiness refresh
    carries them, so the ``effective_year`` here is the floor the year input
    states and the ``raise_id`` is what names the probe's parameters.

    Args:
        salary_profiles: The owner's active
            :class:`~app.models.salary_profile.SalaryProfile` rows.

    **It lists every ACTIVE profile's recurring raises, which is not the
    same set as the raises the page PROJECTS**, and an adversarial review of
    plan step salary:S3-c is why that is said here rather than implied.  The
    projections read ``salary_profiles[0]``, each pension's own
    ``salary_profile`` and the profiles that FUND an account; an owner with
    two active profiles therefore sees rows for raises that feed no figure,
    and a probe on one of those moves nothing.  Listing what the owner has
    RECORDED is the honest claim and the useful one -- the rail links each
    row to the page that edits it -- but it is a weaker claim than "what this
    page projects from", and only the first is true.

    Returns:
        One dict per recurring raise, in profile then row order, carrying

        ``flat_amount``, ``effective_month``, ``effective_year`` and

"""A loan's TERM rows: its params, anchors, rates, escrow lines and due dates.

The half of :mod:`app.services.loan_loaders` that answers *what are this loan's

:class:`~app.models.loan_anchor_event.LoanAnchorEvent` /
:class:`~app.models.loan_features.RateHistory` /
:class:`~app.models.escrow_line.EscrowLine` loaders, the synthesized origination

Sits above :mod:`._shadows`, which owns *which rows are this account's payments*:
:func:`_settled_payment_due_dates` reads that partition and nothing there reads
back.  The two were one 1,054-line module until plan step **balance:X-bl-2a**
pushed it past pylint's 1,000-line ceiling, and the cut is the seam that step
created rather than the line count: a contractual fact about a loan and a query

    """One dated balance assertion for a loan, as plain data.

    The single anchor shape BOTH anchor consumers walk (the read switch's
    final commit): the genesis posting walk derives its opening / true-up
    corrections from these, and the loan resolver's replay fallback consumes
    them as its duck-typed anchor events (it reads ``anchor_date`` /
    ``anchor_balance`` / ``created_at`` / ``event_id``, all here).  Three
    provenances:

    * **The origination anchor is SYNTHESIZED from the immutable
      :class:`LoanParams`** (``origination_date`` / ``original_principal``)
      rather than read from a stored row -- the origination
      :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` write is retired, since that row was always a
      verbatim copy of the params (verified on production data).  Legacy
      stored origination rows are ignored, not migrated: append-only history,
      value-identical to the synthesis.  It is the loan's ONE opening
      (``is_opening=True``), ALWAYS -- a loan originates before it can be
      tracked, so the ledger opens at origination and there is no date it reads
      the loan out of existence (plan step C1).
    * **A tracking-start is a real stored fact** (the ``tracking_start``
      :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` the setup door writes for the balance stated at
      setup, plan step ``recurrence:R20``, or the dashboard's tracking-start
      door appends after the fact): the operator's real balance as of a date.
      It is an ordinary balance ASSERTION (``is_opening=False``,
      ``is_tracking_start=True``) that RESETS the running balance at its own
      date -- NOT the opening.  Where the window between origination and it
      carries no payment record, the walk holds the opening balance flat across
      it (the honest ACTUAL fold; the contractual back-projection that fills it
      is a separate ESTIMATED tier).
    * **A user true-up is a real stored fact** (the ``user_trueup``
      :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` the balance-edit flow appends): the operator's
      dated balance assertion, the source document the self-healing TRUEUP
      correction is derived from and re-derived against.  Also an
      ``is_opening=False`` assertion (``is_tracking_start=False``).

    Attributes:
        account_id: The loan account the assertion belongs to.
        anchor_date: The date the balance was asserted (origination date for
            the opening).
        anchor_balance: The asserted balance owed (the original principal for
            the opening), cent-quantized ``Decimal``.
        is_opening: ``True`` ONLY for the loan's single opening, the synthesized
            origination; ``False`` for a tracking-start or a user true-up (both
            ordinary balance assertions) -- drives the OPENING vs TRUEUP posting
            kinds.
        created_at: The assertion's creation instant, the chronology's SECOND
            term; the synthesized origination uses the earliest possible UTC
            instant so any same-day assertion wins.  It does NOT decide a tie on
            its own: ``created_at`` is ``server_default=func.now()``, which
            PostgreSQL evaluates at TRANSACTION START, so every row written in
            one transaction shares an instant.
        event_id: The stored ``budget.loan_anchor_events.id``, the chronology's
            THIRD and final term -- what makes the key TOTAL, so exactly one
            ordering of a loan's anchors exists (see
            :func:`load_loan_anchor_facts`).  The synthesized origination has no
            stored row and carries :data:`_ORIGINATION_EVENT_ID`.
        is_tracking_start: ``True`` for a ``tracking_start`` assertion (a
            mid-life import's balance-as-of-date), ``False`` for the origination
            opening and every user true-up.  The balance math never branches
            on it: the drift scorecard labels the tracking-start row by it, and
            the write door's duplicate rule scopes its comparison by it
            (:func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service._governing_loan_anchor`,

    The one anchor loader every consumer shares (the genesis walk and every
    resolver-input builder), so no two sites can disagree on what a loan's
    anchors are.  The single ``is_opening`` anchor is ALWAYS the synthesized
    origination (:func:`synthesize_origination_anchor` -- from the immutable
    *params*, never a stored row; see :class:`LoanAnchorFact`).  Every STANDING
    ``tracking_start`` and ``user_trueup`` :class:`LoanAnchorEvent` is loaded as
    an ``is_opening=False`` balance ASSERTION -- the two differ only in
    ``is_tracking_start`` (a label; the walk resets on both identically) --
    through :func:`load_standing_loan_assertions`, so a statement a
    :class:`~app.models.loan_anchor_withdrawal.LoanAnchorWithdrawal` names
    resets nothing (plan step ``recurrence:R23``).

    **The returned order IS the loan's chronology, and stating it HERE is the
    point of this function** (plan step X-an-b, closing finding N-196).  Facts
    come back ascending by ``(anchor_date, created_at, event_id)`` -- BUSINESS
    date first, the recording instant next, the stored row id last -- which is
    the cash side's key, term for term
    (:func:`app.services.cash_ledger.cash_anchor_facts`), and the loan side was
    the only gap.  Two properties are load-bearing and neither was true before:

    * **The key is TOTAL.**  ``created_at`` is ``server_default=func.now()``,
      which PostgreSQL evaluates at TRANSACTION START, so two anchors written in
      one transaction (a backfill, a migration, a fixture) share an instant and
      ``(anchor_date, created_at)`` does not order them.  ``event_id`` does, and
      the later INSERT wins -- the same "the last one recorded is that day's
      closing balance" rule the cash walk and this table's own write door
      (:func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service._governing_loan_anchor`) already apply.
    * **It is ONE statement, not a rule each consumer re-derives.**  This list
      had no ``ORDER BY`` and its two consumers each broke a tie their own way:
      the fold's walk (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`) reset
      at the LAST of a tie, the resolver
      (:func:`app.services.loan_resolver.select_latest_anchor`) took ``max()``,
      the FIRST -- so on a full tie carrying two balances they were GUARANTEED to
      name opposite rows, and which row each named was whatever PostgreSQL
      returned.  Finding **N-133 / R1** ruled this same question on the cash
      side: state the order where the rows are READ, and do not restate it as a
      re-sort in the consumer.

    The sort is in PYTHON rather than an ``ORDER BY`` because the synthesized
    origination has no stored row to order with, so SQL alone cannot produce the
    final list; sorting the MERGED list is what makes the contract hold for
    every fact rather than only the stored ones.

    **Origination is the opening ALWAYS** (plan step C1): a loan originates
    before it can be tracked, so opening at a mid-life ``tracking_start`` read the
    loan out of existence for the whole pre-tracking window (the false pre-opening
    zero, B-11).  A ``tracking_start`` now RESETS the running balance at its own
    date like any true-up, so a date at/after it is unchanged, while a date before
    it reads the origination opening held flat -- the honest fold of the recorded
    facts.

    Args:
        params: The loan's :class:`LoanParams` row (supplies the account id
            and the immutable origination fields).

    Returns:

        created_at, event_id)`` -- always non-empty (the synthesized origination
        opening is always present), so a configured loan is always resolvable.
        The opening is first for every loan the write doors admit, since both
        refuse an assertion earlier than ``origination_date``; the sort does not
        depend on that guard holding.

    * The write door's duplicate rule
      (:func:`app.services.loan_anchor_service._governing_loan_anchor`, ruling
      **R-EQ**) takes the governing statement of one source from this list.  A
      withdrawn statement read there would refuse a new, identical one as
      "already recorded" -- the very correction a withdrawal makes room for.

    They were two queries until this step, and a predicate added to one query

    The project's SINGLE derivation of "which contractual installment is this

    (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.loan_event_stream`),
    the payment-history table
    (:func:`app.services.loan_posting_service.confirmed_loan_payment_history`),
    the forward plan's PLANNED tier and the settled-payment guards below, so no
    two of them can disagree on a payment's due date.

    **It takes a LEG, settled or projected, from every production caller
    since plan step balance:X-bi-6-4b** (a projected one since X-bi-6a).  A
    payment is a :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` of its
    parent transfer, and the two facts this reads -- the ``due_date`` and the
    pay period's start -- are the PARENT's columns, which a leg exposes under
    the same two names.  A shadow row carries both facts too
    (``16f83aa0`` recorded that neither producer's signature would accept a
    transfer; this signature does), so the derivation is one function over
    two row shapes rather than a second spelling per shape, and it keeps
    accepting a shadow until ``X-bi-6-4d`` deletes the shadows.

    The payment's OWN ``due_date`` is the answer: the recurrence engine stamps
    each generated instance with the date its rule produced
    (:func:`app.services.recurrence_engine`), so it is the installment's
    identity as a stored fact.  It is deliberately NOT re-derived from the
    payment's pay period, because a pay period is the CASH basis (when the money
    moved / which period the ledger books it in), not the installment basis: a
    payment settled LATE -- past its due date, into the next biweekly period, a
    routine event over a weekend or holiday -- sits in a pay period that no
    longer contains its due date.  Deriving the due date from that period's
    start (the pre-fix behaviour) then reports the NEXT month's installment: a
    July payment recorded as an August one, which both mis-states the payment
    history and stamps a CONFIRMED schedule row with a FUTURE date, breaking
    every date-basis balance walk that reads it.

    ``monthly_due_date`` remains the fallback for a payment with no stored
    ``due_date`` -- an AD-HOC transfer, since
    ``ck_transfers_template_row_needs_due_date`` dates every transfer of a
    definition and :attr:`app.models.transfer.Transfer.due_date` is nullable
    for the rest.  It
    reconstructs the due date from the pay-period start, which is correct
    exactly while the payment's period still contains its due date.

    PRECONDITION on the stored value, and plan step R7c-c re-words it without
    changing it (plan ledger row **D27**): the payment's recurrence rule must
    fire ON A DAY OF THE MONTH, so
    :func:`app.services.recurrence.compute_due_date` stamps each instance
    with the installment date rather than falling back to ``period.start_date``
    (its no-day behaviour, and the origin of the legacy rows migration
    ``c4e91a7b2d38`` backfills).

    **The predicate was a COLUMN and is now a derivation.** It read
    ``recurrence_rules.day_of_month``, which R7c-c drops; the same question is
    :func:`app.services.recurrence.scheduling_day_of_month` answering non-``None``,
    which is :func:`app.services.recurrence.fires_on_day_of_month` joined with
    the rule's
    first occurrence.  The rules that satisfy it are unchanged -- the migration
    graded the two equal on all 46 live rules before dropping the column -- so
    this is the same precondition stated over the columns that survive.

    The loan payment-transfer flow guarantees it: ``app/routes/loan/
    payment_transfer.py`` derives the cadence through
    ``loan_recurrence_sync.loan_cadence_start``, which states the first
    contractual installment as the rule's ``starts_on``.  A loan payment set up
    as a plain every-paycheck transfer would NOT -- a ``PERIOD``-unit rule has
    no day-of-month coordinate at all -- and would keep regenerating pay-period
    starts into a column the posting walk now reads.  Still unenforced, which
    is what D27 records, and plan step R5 makes it structural by giving a
    generated row its own ``due_on``.

    This value is a POSTING INPUT, not display metadata: the fold's event stream
    (``loan_ledger.loan_event_stream``) DATES every payment by it, the replay
    (``loan_ledger.replay_loan_events``) orders on that date and applies its
    strict ``anchor_date < due_date`` post-anchor boundary against it, and the
    charge calendar keys its accrual periods off it -- so moving it moves the
    POSTED balance.  Any writer of
    ``due_date`` must therefore follow it with a posting reconcile --
    ``transfer_service._POSTING_RELEVANT_FIELDS`` is what enforces that.

    Its ``pay_period`` is read on EVERY call since the derivation moved into the
    shared :func:`installment_for` (previously only the no-``due_date`` branch
    touched it), so a caller must hand it a payment whose ``pay_period`` is
    loaded.  **:func:`._shadows.income_shadows`' two producers are what
    guarantee that**: each adds the parent's period to its load because it
    sorts on it, so every production caller comes through the partition; a
    transfer fetched by a bare ``session.get`` costs a lazy load here rather
    than only on the fallback path.

    Args:
        shadow: The payment's leg -- settled or projected -- or, until
            ``X-bi-6-4d``, a shadow row.  Its ``pay_period`` must be loaded:

            :func:`._shadows.projected_income_legs` each eager-load it (see

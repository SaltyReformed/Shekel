"""WHICH transfers are an account's payments, and which of them have HAPPENED.

The half of :mod:`app.services.loan_loaders` that answers *which payments*,
against :mod:`._terms`' *what are this loan's contractual facts*.  It owns the
two producers -- :func:`settled_income_shadows` and
:func:`projected_income_legs` -- the settled half's membership clause
(:func:`settled_half_clause`), and the partition value that composes them
(:func:`income_shadows`).

A payment INTO an account is the to-side LEG of a transfer into it
(:class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg`): a payment received by a
loan, or a contribution into an investment account.  **Both halves are legs
read off ``budget.transfers`` since plan step balance:X-bi-6-4b**; the settled
half was the loan-side income SHADOW row until then, and the producers keep
their shadow-era names until ``X-bi-6-4d`` deletes the shadows and rewrites
their readers (a coordinator ruling on sequencing, 2026-09-24).

**Its two jobs are both rule-14 answers, and plan step balance:X-bl-2a is where
they became one each.**  Settled-ness had two derivations -- this module's
status-id filter and ``loan_payment_service.get_payment_history``'s read of the
``is_settled`` column -- agreeing under a pinned parity; and the amount model's
eager-load set was baked into the query, so a ROW loader decided what its
callers would traverse.  The partition is single now, and the load is the
caller's statement.

**The two halves are ONE relation, each other's complement, since X-bi-6-4b**
(ruling **R-BAL140**).  A payment is PLANNED while its transfer is Projected
and its side's money has not moved -- :func:`~app.services.transfer_legs
.planned_transfer_legs`' test, ruling **R-BAL79** -- and SETTLED otherwise, so
each half is the other's exact complement over the live, non-excluded
transfers into the account and no payment can be counted twice or not at all.
From X-bi-6a to X-bi-6-4b the settled half was the shadow rows keyed on the
SHADOW's status while the plan half keyed on the parent's, so a status drift
no door writes was counted twice (a settled shadow holding no movement under a
Projected parent) or not at all (a Projected shadow under a settled parent).

A LEAF: models, the ref cache, the shared balance predicates and
:mod:`app.services.transfer_legs`, whose one join attaches each settled leg's
covering movement as its record.  Flask-isolated, reads only, no commits.  No
amount is read off a transfer for a payment that has settled: a settled leg is
worth what its record moved (Transfer Invariant 5).

    each producer adds) -- fewer when the periods are already loaded and more
    with whatever the caller's options add; a consumer wanting one half pays
    for that half alone.

    **The classification is TOTAL and refuses what it cannot place.**  A
    transfer here is settled, or it is ``Projected``; the balance-excluded
    statuses are dropped in SQL, so nothing else can arrive today.  That is a
    claim about the ``ref.statuses`` seed, not about this code, and a set

    :class:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg` per live, non-excluded
    transfer INTO the account in the scenario that :func:`settled_half_clause`
    admits -- not Projected, or its to-side money has moved (ruling
    **R-BAL140**) -- each carrying its covering movement as its ``record``
    through the one join (:func:`~app.services.transfer_legs.grid_transfer_legs`),
    and NOTHING ELSE.  Every settled-payment consumer reads this ONE set, so no
    two can disagree on which payments are settled: the fold's event stream
    (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`), the fold's display bound
    (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.confirmed_shadows_through`), the ledger's
    per-payment principal reader, the asset contribution pass, and
    :func:`_settled_payment_due_dates` (the escrow forward-only guard's
    boundary :func:`latest_settled_payment_due_date`, since finding N-34; the
    tracking-start ordering guard that also read it was deleted at plan step
    ``recurrence:R20``).

    **The set is keyed on the TRANSFER, never on its movement alone.**  A
    ``$0.00`` close -- a transfer settled with no movement, ruling **R-BAL82**
    -- is a payment of nothing that still settles an installment, so the walk
    must see it; :func:`~app.services.transfer_legs.recorded_transfer_legs`,
    which is movement-rooted, would drop it.  Its leg carries no record and is
    dated by the installment it skips (ruling **R-BAL139**,
    :func:`app.services.loan_ledger.payment_visible_on`).

    **Each transfer that arrives must be settled or Projected, and the gap is
    the refusal.**  The query excludes the balance-excluded statuses and
    admits a Projected transfer only when its to-side money has moved (the
    status drift R-BAL140 counts once, by its movement); a sixth status that
    is neither is admitted by the clause's ``NOT Projected`` arm, so it is
    refused by name HERE, at the one door every settled-payment reader
    passes, rather than wherever a reader first values it.

    Two bounds the resolver's
    :func:`app.services.rate_period_engine.is_confirmed_payment_eligible` filter
    applies are deliberately ABSENT:

    * **No post-anchor LOWER bound.**  The fold walks EVERY settled payment from
      origination, because an anchor is a running-balance RESET
      (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.walk_loan_ledger`), not a payment exclusion.
      A pre-anchor payment is split and posted (its principal effect is later
      subsumed by the anchor correction), never silently dropped.
    * **No has-happened-yet UPPER bound.**  Settlement is the confirming event: the
      Step-2 cash entry posts the moment a payment settles, so the split correction
      must post in the SAME moment or the loan-linked ledger holds raw cash with no
      interest / escrow backout from the payment's period start until the next loan
      write (the 2026-07-02 adversarial review's H2 -- demonstrated as a ~$1,636
      understatement on the real Mortgage).  The READERS apply their own bound, so
      posting early changes when the fact is RECORDED, never when it is SHOWN.

      **That bound is the payment's SETTLED day, not its pay period, on every
      reader** -- the fold's since step C2 (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.payment_visible_on`),
      the resolver's replay since plan step **X-an**.  This paragraph used to say
      the readers' PERIOD bound kept an early-settled payment out of every
      displayed balance until its period began, and finding **N-187** is that
      sentence being false in both directions at once: an early-settled payment
      IS shown from the day its cash moved, and the resolver was the one reader
      still waiting for the period -- so it planned an installment the ledger had
      already paid down.

    Sorted by pay-period start -- the app's canonical payment chronology and the
    order the fold's running balance is walked in -- with the TRANSFER's id as
    the deterministic tie-breaker, the key the projected half already used.  It
    was the shadow's id until X-bi-6-4b, and the two orders agree wherever a
    transfer's shadows were written with it -- measured, not argued: 0
    inversions on the 2026-09-23 21:17 production dump.  A shadow re-created
    later takes a later id; the transfer's id is immune to that.  The order is
    immaterial to the guards (they take a ``min`` / ``max`` / set), and
    load-bearing for the walk, so it
    is applied ONCE here rather than by each caller.  The resolver's
    biweekly-collision redistribution (a display fix) is NOT applied, and is
    immaterial to a sequentially walked running balance.  ``pay_period`` is
    eager-loaded HERE, which reads it itself as the sort key.

"""What the BANK says an account held at the end of a day -- ONE fold, sampled.

An anchored import states a figure for a day (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6e-1``,
ruling **R-GF**), and the recorded lines say what moved on every day around it.
Together they determine the bank's own balance for any day the lines reach::

    bank_balance(D) = anchor.balance + sum(lines posted in (anchor.day, D])

with the sign falling out of which day comes first, so no branch decides it.

**One anchor PER RUN, and every other level in the run is a CHECKPOINT**
(plan step ``balance:X-bj-1b``, finding **N-343**, rulings **R-BAL63** to
**R-BAL66**).  The recorded days fall into RUNS -- contiguous stretches some
import covers (:func:`covered_runs`) -- and a run is as far as any walk can
honestly go, so the choice of what to walk from is a choice per run: the
strongest standing bank level the run reaches, then the latest day.  Every
other standing bank level the run reaches is read as a checkpoint,
``walked - observed``, which is the bank's record checked against itself: two
of its own figures with every line between them recorded either agree to the
cent or one of them was placed on a day it is not the balance for.  Until this
step ONE level was chosen for the whole account, so a ``file_chain`` level in
an old run left every day of a later, disconnected run unpriced -- including
that run's own placed day, whose crossing is empty.  A run holding lines and
no standing bank level anchors on nothing (**R-BAL64**): its days are absent
rather than priced from a level the owner typed, which ruling **R-BAL52**
keeps out of this walk permanently.

**One derivation, sampled at whatever grain the reader asks for**, which is the
discipline the cash side already pays for and this module exists to keep:
:func:`fold_bank_balances` prefix-sums the account's recorded days ONCE and
reads that running total at every requested day -- and at every checkpoint's
day, through the same :func:`_walked` -- and :func:`bank_balance_on` is that
same fold sampled at one.  A scalar that re-walked to its date with its own
window is exactly the shape that put ``$15.96`` between the cash scalar and
the cash series on the real Checking account (``balance_at._cash_flow``), and
a statement account will hold a few hundred recorded days, so there is nothing
to buy by writing the second walk.

**Two readers, and they mean different things by EVIDENCE.**
:func:`~._anchor.recorded_opening_before` asks this for the balance before a
file's first line, and what it learns is that TWO STATEMENTS AGREE -- so it
caps what it returns at
:attr:`~app.enums.StatementBalanceEvidenceEnum.CORROBORATED` and applies its own
weakest-link rule on top, against the anchor of the run that priced the day
(:meth:`BankBalances.anchor_for`).  A REPORT asks this to display a figure and
learns nothing new, so it carries each anchor's own strength unchanged.  The
cap therefore lives at the reader that earns it, never here.  A checkpoint
that DISAGREES changes neither reader's answer (**R-BAL66**): the comparison
is an instrument and never a gate (**R-GF**), and by rank the checkpoint is the
weaker of the two figures, so letting it weaken the anchor would invert the
evidence ladder.

**A day is answered only when the recorded lines REACH it** from its run's
anchor.  The walk is exact only if every line between the two days is
recorded; a gap between imports means lines nobody has imported, and summing
across one yields a confident wrong number.  Such a day is ABSENT from the
fold's result rather than present with a guess -- the same direction
:func:`~._anchor.recorded_opening_before` already fails in, and for the same
reason.

**The windows it reads are trustworthy only because deletion releases
anchors** (:func:`~._anchor.release_anchors_from`): an import's window claims
days its lines covered, and ``delete_import`` takes the lines only it sighted
while a later overlapping import keeps its own window.  Before that release
existed this reported "covered" over a `$150.00` hole.

Services-boundary discipline: no Flask import, no clock read.  It queries, which
is this package's shape (:mod:`._identity`, :mod:`._anchor`) and for the same
reason -- the recorded-history half of one subject is not a different subject.

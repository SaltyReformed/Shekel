"""Which day is a statement's stated balance the balance FOR, and how firmly?

**A bank states its balance as of the EXPORT INSTANT and labels it with the
export's own day, so the day on the header is not the day the figure is for.**
Measured on the developer's own SECU exports: the 2026-08-21 file reads
``Balance as of 08/21/2026,2501.310000`` while its last line is 08-18 and
``2501.31`` is 08-18's closing; the 2026-08-16 file reads ``$4,747.63``, which
is 2026-08-13's closing, over a list containing two 2026-08-14 lines worth
``-$1,006.72``.  Ruling **R-GF**, plan step ``bank_import:X-f6e-1``.

**So the claim and the day it is for are two facts, and the LINES solve the
second.**  Given a known opening -- the balance before the file's first line --
the stated figure is effective at day ``d`` exactly when::

    stated - sum(lines posted on or before d) == opening

over the candidates ``{the day before the declared window} + {every line
day} + {the day the window ends, or the day the header names if earlier}``,
bounded above by the day the header itself names.  **The line days and the
stated day, NOT every day of the window** (ruling **R-BAL74**, amending
**R-BAL71**'s candidate clause; developer 2026-09-18 on X-f6b-1's adversarial
review): a feed sync that returned no line
since the last one still places the bank's figure on the day the bank stated
it, because that day is a candidate in its own right; a CSV, whose window is
its own line extremes, keeps exactly the candidates it had.  The build's
first cut took EVERY day of the window and named the LATEST satisfying one,
which put a figure that lags its file onto the last QUIET day after the line
it is the closing of -- and that is money, not naming: the cash walk treats
an app row settled on or before a level's day as already inside the bank's
figure, so on the developer's own 08-16 lag shape over a weekend a purchase
settled on the Saturday was absorbed into Friday's closing and Monday's
derived balance read `$25.00` high until the next assertion.  Found by
adversarial review 2026-09-18.

**A SOLVED day is only as good as the opening it was solved against**, which is
why :class:`~app.enums.StatementBalanceEvidenceEnum` records the WEAKEST LINK
in the chain behind the figure rather than how the day was worked out.  An
anchor solved against an uncorroborated opening is uncorroborated; recording
the minimum makes that true by construction, and is what stops a re-upload of
the same file from laundering an assumption into a corroboration.

**A file may legitimately state a balance NO day of its own explains**, and
that is measured rather than allowed for: a DATE-RANGE export states the
CURRENT balance, not the range's closing.  The developer's own
2026-01-02..2026-03-31 export, pulled 2026-08-23, reads
``Balance as of 08/23/2026,2459.600000`` -- 145 days past its last line and
`$255.41` from the `$2,715.01` its 139 lines imply.  Such a file records its
CLAIM with no anchor, which is the honest absence rather than a guess.

**Only a file that contradicts ITSELF is refused**, and that needs no evidence
from outside it: a per-line running balance states what the account held on
every day the file covers, so a header the chain reaches on no such day is a
file disagreeing with itself.  An earlier draft refused on a mismatch against
RECORDED history too, and an adversarial review reproduced it rejecting an
honest export while blaming the file for the app's own stale anchor.

**An anchor is a conclusion drawn from lines, so the doors that CHANGE lines
release it** (:func:`release_anchors_from`).  Recording a line at or before an
anchor's day means that anchor was solved without it; deleting an import means
the lines it was solved against are gone.  Both were reproduced as silently
wrong openings -- `$150.00` on the delete path -- before the release existed.
Releasing rather than re-solving is deliberate: the next import re-establishes
an anchor from evidence that is present, where a re-solve would be the app
inferring its way around facts that moved underneath it.

**A placed anchor is a LEVEL, and a release is an APPENDED withdrawal** (plan
step ``balance:X-bj-1``, rulings **R-IS** and **R-JN**).  The solved day and
its evidence were two columns on ``budget.statement_imports`` until that step,
nulled by UPDATE to release; they are a row in the level relation
(:class:`~app.models.account.AccountAnchorHistory`, ``statement_import_id``
set, its amount locked to the file's own claim by key) beside the owner's
true-ups, and a release is an :class:`~app.models.anchor_release.AnchorRelease`
naming the level and the import whose lines undercut it.  A level STANDS when
no release names it; :func:`~._balance.bank_levels` is the one read of that,
and :func:`~._balance.standing_bank_levels` its narrowing.  What this bought: the badge on
the statements page can name a release's cause (finding **BAL-485**), and the
relation is append-only at the database tier as its siblings are.

**Deriving a balance from a recorded anchor is :mod:`._balance`'s**, not this
module's, and the split is the walk/fold one the cash side already pays for: a
FOLD is a balance, a walk is a fact.  This module decides which DAY a claimed
figure is for; that one turns a settled anchor plus the recorded lines into a
balance for any day, and :func:`recorded_opening_before` is one of its two
readers.  Keeping the arithmetic there is what stops the report added at plan
step ``bank_import:X-f6e-2`` becoming a second statement of it.

Services-boundary discipline: no Flask import, no clock read.  It DOES query,
which is :mod:`._identity`'s shape in this package and for the same reason: the
recorded-history half of one subject is not a different subject.

    own day, so a write that changes those lines takes the conclusion with
    it.**  Both doors that change them call this:
    :func:`~._record.record_statement` with the earliest day it freshly
    recorded, and :func:`~._undo.delete_import` with the earliest day whose
    lines it is about to remove.  Which levels go is :func:`resting_on`'s
    answer over :func:`~._balance.standing_bank_levels`; this function only
    writes.

    **It writes a release row per level and edits nothing** (plan step
    ``balance:X-bj-1``): the level relation is append-only at the database
    tier, and a withdrawal that stays beside the level it withdrew is what
    lets the statements page say WHY a figure is no longer placed.

    Args:
        account_id: The account whose anchors to examine.
        day: The earliest day whose lines changed.
        import_id: The import whose lines changed -- the cause the release
            records, and the import whose OWN level is never released by its
            own lines.  ONE parameter for both roles because they are one
            import at both doors: the recording import solved its level
            against its own complete line list, so those lines never undercut
            it; the delete door names the DOOMED import here before deleting
            it, so the cause reaches ``system.audit_log`` before the key's
            ``SET NULL`` takes it off the row, and that import's own level is
            about to cascade rather than be withdrawn.

    Returns:
        How many anchors were released.

    **Reproduced as money before this existed**, by two independent adversarial
    reviews on 2026-08-23.  A later export inserting a line into a day an
    earlier anchor had already priced left that anchor believing a balance the
    bank had since restated, and the next import solved its own day against it
    -- storing a day two days early under a *corroborated* badge, and refusing
    an honest export with a figure the bank's file never asserted.  Deleting an
    import removed the lines an anchor rested on while a later overlapping
    import kept its span, so the coverage test reported "covered" over a
    `$150.00` hole.  One rule closes both: the evidence moved, so the
    conclusion goes.

    **Released rather than re-solved, deliberately.**  Re-solving would be the
    app inferring its way around facts that have changed underneath it; the
    next import re-establishes an anchor from evidence that is actually
    present, and until then the account honestly holds none.

    Args:
        parsed: The file -- its lines in chronological order, the window it
            declares and the claim its header makes, or none.  The two claim
            fields are ``None`` together, which the adapter holds and this
            refuses to depend on: a function whose whole job is to be total
            over its inputs may not rest a guard on another module's
            invariant.  The lines may be EMPTY (a feed sync over a quiet
            window states a balance and no line); only the file-chain arm
            reads a line, and an empty file carries no chain.
        recorded: What the account's already-recorded statements say it held
            before the window's first day, with the strength of that claim,
            or ``None`` when they do not say.

    Returns:
        The :class:`ImportedBalance`, or ``None`` when the file states no
        balance at all.  A file that DOES state one but whose own lines cannot
        reach the day it claims gets a value with ``effective_on`` and
        ``evidence`` both ``None`` -- the claim recorded, the anchor
        undetermined, which is the honest absence rather than a guess.
        :attr:`~ImportedBalance.day_is_solved` says which of the three arms
        answered: the first two WORK OUT a day, the third assumes one.

    Raises:
        StatementBalanceUnexplained: When the file carries a per-line running
            balance that reaches its own header figure on no day it covers.
            **Only that**: a mismatch against RECORDED history is not the
            file's fault, and an earlier draft refused honest exports for it.

    **Three arms, and each is named rather than reached by falling out of a
    loop.**  A first draft iterated ``(chain, recorded)`` and returned on the
    first non-``None``, which stated a fallback that did not exist -- a chain
    that failed to solve never tried the recorded opening, correctly, but the
    shape said otherwise.  Found by adversarial review 2026-08-23.

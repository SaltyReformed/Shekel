"""The SECU checking CSV adapter -- one source, read into the shared shape.

Ruling **R-FP**'s file path.  It turns State Employees' Credit Union's own
transaction export into :class:`~._line.StatementLine` values and does nothing
else: no database, no clock, no request, no matching.

**Why this format and not the OFX**, measured on the developer's own exports
2026-08-16 and recorded here because the answer is not obvious:

* SECU publishes the same statement as OFX, QFX, QBO and CSV.  The first three
  are the SAME file -- 342 identical ``STMTTRN`` blocks, differing only by two
  Intuit routing tags -- so the choice is really CSV or OFX.
* The OFX truncates every description to the OFX ``NAME`` limit: 326 of 361
  lines land at exactly 32 characters, which renders a card purchase as
  ``POINT OF SALE DEBIT L340 DATE 12`` with no merchant in it at all.  The CSV
  carries up to 96 characters including the merchant, and the CSV description
  STARTS WITH the OFX name on 306 of 306 shared lines -- the same statement,
  one of them cut short.
* The CSV carries the bank's own category and, when the export option is
  ticked, a per-line RUNNING BALANCE.  The OFX carries neither.
* The OFX's one advantage is ``FITID``.  It buys nothing measurable: the
  positional identity key reproduced the ``FITID`` key exactly across two
  exports twelve days apart (:func:`~._line.group_key`).

**Columns are bound by HEADER NAME, never by position, and that is a measured
requirement rather than defensive style.**  SECU offers two balance options and
they occupy the SAME column index with DIFFERENT meanings: index 10 reads
``Running Balance`` in one export on disk and ``Daily Balance`` in another,
where the latter is populated only on each day's last line.  A positional read
silently reinterprets one as the other -- and on a span whose days each hold a
single transaction it would pass every check while meaning something else.
:func:`_bind_columns` refuses ``Daily Balance`` by name and says which option to
tick.

**The file states itself twice more, and BOTH are required here.**  A CSV export
ends with a TOTALS row -- ``Category`` reading ``Totals:``, a ``Memo`` reading
``N items``, and the credit and debit sums.  It is both a trap and a gift.  The
trap: it parses as a transaction and would import as a fabricated
``+$43,597.96`` / ``-$43,213.56`` line dated nowhere.  The gift: it grades the
parse.  **This adapter REFUSES a file without it**, because it is the only
cross-check that survives when the running-balance option is not ticked -- and
it is the last row of the file, which is exactly what a truncated or interrupted
download loses.  All six of the developer's real exports carry it.

What is NOT checked, and why: the file's own ``Balance as of`` header.  It was
measured to lag the line list -- on the 2026-08-16 export SECU reported
``$4,747.63``, which is 2026-08-13's closing balance, while the same statement
listed two 2026-08-14 lines worth ``-$1,006.72``.  A gate on a figure the bank
computes at a different instant from the lines would refuse honest files.

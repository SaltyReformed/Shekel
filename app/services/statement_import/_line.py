            the whole arc exists to obtain -- of 110 movements matched to bank
            lines on exact amount, only 33 carried the day the app had recorded
            (finding **N-173**).
        transaction_on: The civil day the bank STATED the transaction itself
            happened, or ``None`` where the source states none.
            **The NULL is the source saying so, not the app not knowing**
            (plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-3a``): this field held a COPY of
            :attr:`posted_on` for a source that does not distinguish the two,
            so no reader could tell an observed swipe day from a restatement of
            the clearing day -- and a match writes this day onto a purchase's
            ``purchased_on``, where a clearing day would claim the purchase was
            made on the day it cleared.
            **It is NOT bounded by ``posted_on``**: 2 of 361 lines in the
            developer's own SECU export carry an OFX ``DTUSER`` one day AFTER
            their ``DTPOSTED``, both ACH deposits.
        amount: Signed, positive INTO the account -- the same convention
            ``cash_ledger.settled_cash_leg`` uses, so a later match compares
            two figures that already agree about direction.

            re-import PAIRS on** (:func:`pair_by_statement`): it is what the

        merchant: What the bank calls the MERCHANT, or ``None`` where the
            source names none.
            **The NULL is the source saying so**, exactly as
            :attr:`transaction_on`'s is, and for a sharper reason: plan step
            ``bank_import:X-f6a-3d`` makes this string the KEY a merchant
            rule is stated against, so a source that cannot name
            a merchant must key NOTHING rather than key something wrong.
            Measured on the developer's own 2026-08-16 exports: SECU's CSV
            names one on **361 of 361** lines, and its OFX truncates 326 of
            those same 361 descriptions to exactly 32 characters -- so dozens
            of distinct merchants arrive as the identical string
            ``POINT OF SALE DEBIT L340 DATE 12``.  A reader that fell back to
            the description would key a policy on that and fire it on every
            one of them; ``None`` fires on nothing.
        source_category: The bank's own category string, or ``None``.
            Provenance only: it is the bank's opinion about a merchant, and
            reading it as a Shekel category would be a reference value no
            ``ref`` table governs.

    ``sequence_in_group`` is derived from the order lines happened to appear in

    with nothing reconciling the two -- the root cause three of this project's

    **Two measured consequences of comparing positionally, both reproduced

      the bank had restated a line it had not;
    * a genuinely NEW ``$4.75`` line that the bank INSERTED ahead of the
      recorded one was refused with the same sentence, for a line that had
      never been recorded.  The insertion behaviour is OBSERVED rather than
      hypothetical: it is why :func:`~._record._refuse_restatement` stopped
      comparing running balances.

    Pairing on the wording answers both correctly and still refuses the event
    the refusal was designed for (:attr:`GroupPairing.restates`).

    The same coffee twice at the same shop for the same price is two lines with

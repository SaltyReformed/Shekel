"""Which account at a SOURCE is which account here -- the whole of that fact.

Ruling **R-FP**: the source-account mapping "is a fact, not a guess".  This
module is its entire life, and gathering the three moments in one place is what
plan step ``bank_import:X-f6a-4`` added: it is LEARNED from a first import,
CHECKED against every import after, and FORGOTTEN with the last import that
could have taught it.  The first two lived in the write door and the third was
written in the undo door beside a byte-identical lookup, which pylint's
cross-file ``duplicate-code`` reported and was right to.

**The forgetting is what makes a wrongly-recorded pairing repairable**, which
is the second live shape of finding **N-302**.  The pairing refuses every later
file that names a different account -- correct, and until X-f6a-4 unrepairable:
an owner who chose the wrong Shekel account on a first import could never
import that account's statements again, because nothing in ``app/`` deleted an
``account_external_identities`` row.

Services-boundary discipline: plain data in, no Flask import.  Nothing here
commits.

    Ruling **R-FP**: the source-account mapping is a FACT, not a guess.  The
    user states which account a file is for; the FILE states which account it
    is for; and this is where the two are held together.

    **It reads and raises; it writes nothing.**  Recording is
    :func:`record_identity`, and the split is not tidiness: the write door's
    whole claim is that it refuses BEFORE it stages anything, and an ``add``
    here would be autoflushed by the very next query -- ahead of the last
    refusal the door can still raise.  A claim that a refusal "leaves the
    database exactly as it was without depending on the rollback" has to be
    true of the ordering, not just of the outcome.

    **It checks in BOTH directions**, and the second one is the arm that
    matters.  Comparing only against this account's own recorded identity would
    let a file already claimed by ANOTHER of the owner's accounts be imported
    here as a first import -- so one bank statement would be recorded twice,
    under two accounts, and the second account's balance would later be
    reconciled against the wrong bank.

    **Both lookups are scoped to the OWNER.**  A global search would make one
    user's masked account number ("******3820", a 10,000-value space) collide
    with another user's, permanently locking the loser out of importing their
    own statements -- and the refusal would disclose that some other account in
    the system held that number, which is the existence oracle the project's
    404-for-both rule exists to prevent.

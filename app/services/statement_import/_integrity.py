"""Does the statement agree with ITSELF?

A source carrying a per-line running balance states the same account twice --
once as a sequence of amounts, once as a sequence of balances -- and the two
must agree.  That redundancy is the only self-check the app has over a record it
did not author, and it is worth more than it looks: it catches a missing line, a
mis-ordered parse and an edited file, none of which any later stage could
distinguish from the truth.

**The chain is an EXPORT OPTION, so most files arrive without it**, and what
stands in its place is two other self-checks rather than nothing: the adapter
refuses a file that disagrees with its own ``Totals:`` summary
(``_secu_csv._verify_against_totals``), which catches a dropped line, and
:mod:`._anchor` solves the file's stated balance against a known opening, which
catches a file whose header and lines cannot both be true.  SECU stopped
offering the running-balance column on its standard download between the
2026-07-19 and 2026-08-16 exports, so every file the app sees today takes that
path.

**The header is not a substitute for this chain and never was** (ruling
**R-FP**'s adapter question, 2026-08-16): a bank writes it as of the export
INSTANT, so the developer's 2026-08-16 export reads ``$4,747.63`` -- 2026-08-13's
closing -- while listing two 2026-08-14 lines worth ``-$1,006.72``.  What
:mod:`._anchor` does with it is solve WHICH DAY it is the balance for rather
than assume it is the last one, which is the difference between reading a
header as a closing balance and reading it as an observation.

Services-boundary discipline: plain data in, nothing written, no clock read.

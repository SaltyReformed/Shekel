"""The SOURCE ADAPTER registry -- ruling **R-FP**'s seam, in one table.

*A statement importer is a SOURCE ADAPTER over one normalized line shape*, so
everything downstream of this module -- verification, identity, recording, and
in later leaves the matching and its review -- is source-independent.  Adding a
way for a statement to arrive is a parser plus one row here plus one
:class:`~app.enums.StatementSourceEnum` member; it is never a branch in the
importer.

**One adapter today, and that is a scope decision rather than an oversight.**
SECU's checking CSV is the only format the developer's own accounts need for
this leaf: the Capital One card export has no Shekel account to be imported
into until the credit-card arc creates one, and ``X-f6b``'s automated source is
its own step.  What this module buys with one entry is that the second one
costs nothing structural -- which is the whole of R-FP.

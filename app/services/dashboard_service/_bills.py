Shekel Budget App -- Dashboard: the shared bill query and bill dict.

The ONE Projected-expense item load the dashboard's two bill surfaces
read (the still-due totals and the due-soon list, both in
:func:`~._pulse.compute_pulse_section`) -- the set's own rows and the
expense legs of its transfers since leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-1b`` -- plus the
render-ready bill dict those items become, with the E-21 single-base entry
progress.  Defined here once rather than per producer, so the item set, the
eager loads and the Projected / expense / not-deleted filter cannot drift
apart.

Pure aggregation -- no Flask imports, no database writes.

    """Load the unpaid (Projected) expense items for a set of periods.

    The single load the dashboard's bill surfaces share -- the still-due
    totals and the due-soon list (both in
    :func:`~._pulse.compute_pulse_section`) -- so the item set, the
    eager-loads and the Projected / expense / not-deleted filter are defined
    exactly once rather than copied per producer (DRY).

    **The items are the PAYCHECK's across the owner's cash-flow set --
    checking and its cards -- not one account's** (developer ruling
    ``credit_card:R-CC16``, plan step CC-4-3), and since leaf
    ``balance:X-bi-6-1b`` (ruling **R-BAL86**) they are the set's OWN rows
    plus one LEG per transfer, read off the parent in ``budget.transfers``
    rather than off a shadow row: :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set
    .own_rows_clause` selects every member's plan rows and no shadow, and
    :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.set_transfer_legs_in_periods` draws
    each transfer the set touches in these periods from the side
    :func:`~app.services.cash_flow_set.leg_accounts_shown` names (ruling
    ``R-CC23``: once, from the balance line's side, when both endpoints are
    members).  It was ``Transaction.account_id == account_id``, then the
    paycheck-rows clause that carried the near-side shadow in as an expense
    row; the two loads below keep both properties and neither selects a
    shadow row of its own (a settled leg's RECORD is still reached through
    the one join in ``transfer_legs``, which walks ``transactions.transfer_id``
    until ``X-bi-6-4`` re-parents the movement).

    **A transfer's EXPENSE leg is a bill; its income leg is not**
    (:func:`~app.services.transfer_legs.expense_legs`, the one spelling the
    Spending report shares).  The Gate B4b ruling read "a transfer-out shadow
    is an obligation the paycheck still owes on the member it leaves"; a leg
    states the same thing from its side rather than from a row's type: the
    from-side leg (money leaves) is kept, the to-side leg (money arrives)
    dropped.  A payment from the
    balance account to a card is therefore one obligation, on the balance
    line's side; a card -> checking transfer is none (the set shows it from
    the balance line, where it is an income leg); a transfer with one
    endpoint outside the set (card -> savings) shows from its member
    endpoint, as a checking -> savings transfer always has.

    selectinload(entries) + joinedload(template) avoid N+1 lookups when a
    consumer checks ``tracks_purchases`` or iterates purchases for the
    entries-aware still-due / progress computation; the transfer load
    states its own (the pricing chain, which includes the period a bill's
    ``period_start_date`` reads).  The Projected filter routes through the
    centralized ``is_projected_clause`` (D6-09 / MED-02) over BOTH tables so
    every SQL filter over Projected shares one definition with the Python
    ``is_projected`` predicate.

        cash_flow: The owner's cash-flow set, whose members' items to load.
        scenario_id: The scenario the items belong to.

            yields an empty result.

        :class:`Transaction` rows with ``category``, ``pay_period``,

def txn_to_bill_dict(

    """Build a bill dict for the dashboard bills template from a plan item.

    Used by :func:`~._pulse._due_soon` to produce one
    render-ready dict per due-soon bill.

    **The item is a row or a transfer leg** (leaf ``balance:X-bi-6-1b``),
    and every question below is one both shapes answer -- a leg reads its
    ``name``, ``due_date``, ``pay_period``, ``category`` and
    ``tracks_purchases`` off its parent, the last as ``False`` -- so there
    is no branch here on which it is.  Two keys are identity: ``id`` is
    :func:`~app.services.transfer_legs.cell_key` (a row's id, a leg's
    ``(transfer id, account id)``), and ``is_transfer`` says the item is a
    leg where it used to say the row carried a ``transfer_id``.

    Expects txn.template and txn.entries to be accessible -- callers
    dealing with collections should eager-load them via selectinload
    /joinedload to avoid N+1 queries.

    E-21 / MED-03 / F-028 / F-056: for entry-tracked (envelope) bills
    the ``amount`` field is set from the row's resolved BUDGET so it shares
    the same declared base as ``entry_remaining`` and
    ``entry_over_budget`` (built from the same figure in
    :func:`_entry_progress_fields`).  ``amount_base`` carries the
    label the template surfaces to the user ("budget") so the base is
    disclosed in the UI, not implicit.  Non-entry-tracked rows show what
    the row CONTRIBUTES; ``amount_base`` is None there so the template
    skips the label.

    **That contribution arrives as an ARGUMENT** (plan step X-au-c2).  It
    read ``txn.effective_amount``, a model property that could not answer
    for a row whose amount is DERIVED -- such a row stores no figure, and
    resolving a paycheck needs the owner's whole pay-period set, which no
    per-row property can hold.  The caller resolves the whole row set
    ONCE through :func:`app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id` and
    indexes it here, so the paycheck engine runs once per read pass
    rather than once per bill (finding **N-228**).

    Args:
        txn: The row or transfer leg to convert.
        today: The reference date used to compute days_until_due.
        contribution: What this row contributes, from the caller's
            :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.contributions_by_id` map --
            ``0`` for a row that contributes nothing, the entered
            figure a SETTLED row RECORDED as moved, else the row's resolved
            amount.  Read only for a non-entry-tracked row; an envelope
            answers on its E-21 budget base instead.
        budget: What the row's amount RESOLVES to, from the caller's
            :func:`~app.services.cash_ledger.amounts_by_id` map -- the E-21
            declared base.  An ARGUMENT rather than a read of
            ``txn.estimated_amount`` since plan step X-au-c2b, for the reason
            the contribution beside it is one: under the amount model a derived
            row stores no figure in that column, and this is the second of the
            two questions a caller must resolve for a whole row set at once.

    Returns:
        Dict matching the bills template contract, including the
        entry progress fields from _entry_progress_fields and the
        ``amount_base`` label that discloses which base the amount

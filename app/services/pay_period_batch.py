Shekel Budget App -- Pay Period Batch

**What a batch of paydays IS, and what refuses one** -- split out of
:mod:`app.services.pay_period_write` at plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-c-1``
(developer ruling **R-PC74**, 2026-09-12, closing ledger row **PC-507**).  A
batch has a size this app will materialise in one call
(:data:`PERIOD_BATCH_MIN` .. :data:`PERIOD_BATCH_MAX`,
:func:`reject_out_of_range_batch_size`), a first payday that must be a civil
day (:func:`reject_undatable_payday`), the days it lands on
(:func:`requested_paydays`), a floor it may not start under
(:func:`reject_backward_payday`) and a ceiling it may not start at
(:func:`reject_skipped_paycheck`, since plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-c-2a``).
None of that touches a row: the writer asks every one of these before it
issues a statement, which is what lets it promise that a refused batch leaves
nothing behind.

**Why a module of its own.**  The writer stood at 998 of pylint's 1,000 lines
after ``C17-a`` and ``C17-b-2``, and ``C17-c-2`` -- the leaf that rewrites its
doors -- could not land in a file at the ceiling.  **PC-507 named the remedy a
SPLIT and not a trim**, on the terms ledger row **PC-498** records (answering a
ceiling by deleting argument is how a module loses the reasoning that keeps it
correct), and named the PLACEMENT the developer's rather than the next
session's to assume, as **R-PC60** placed ``_grid`` and **R-PC69** placed
``_projection``.  He placed it here: the whole batch shape, leaving the writer
its two doors and its statements.  What stays there is what
``TestThereIsOneWriter`` pins to that file -- the one ``PayPeriod(...)``
construction and the one ``DELETE`` in ``app/`` -- and this module imports no
model and issues no statement, so that census reads exactly as it did.

**Three of these names are PUBLIC and were private before the move**, for the
reason :mod:`app.services.pay_period_gates` gives: a function another module
calls is part of this module's surface, and keeping the underscore would have
made every call site read as a privacy breach.  Nothing here computes
differently than it did inside the writer -- a move and a rename, ``$0.00``.

**The dependency runs ONE WAY**: the writer imports this module, and this
module imports nothing from the writer, ``pay_period_admin`` or the routes.
Its imports are the derivation (:mod:`app.services.pay_calendar`, whose
producers the batch's days and its floor are answered by), the rhythm value
and the form error it raises.

The floor and its mirror, and why a third refusal was DELETED
=============================================================

Plan ruling **R-PC1** stated ONE rule -- "the last paycheck must hold no row
dated on or after the new payday".  Tracing it against ``shekel-prod-db`` found
it wrong in both directions, so the developer ruled it into two (2026-08-10): a
structural floor and a financial coverage rule.  What survives is the floor,
and since plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-c-2a`` its mirror stands beside it.

:func:`reject_backward_payday` -- **structural, and TEMPORARY.**  A new payday
may not land inside a paycheck the owner already has.  Its only job is keeping
plan step **C6**'s mid-schedule insert closed, and **C6 removes it.**

:func:`reject_skipped_paycheck` -- **structural, and PERMANENT** (rulings
**R-PC67** and **R-PC76**).  A batch's first new payday may not fall at or
past the SECOND payday the owner's plan projects after their record, because
then a whole planned paycheck is missing between the two and the derived
calendar -- which cannot express a hole -- files it into the paycheck before.
Both read the plan through
:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.planned_paydays_after` -- the floor its
first day over the STORED eras (the calendar as it derives today), the
ceiling its second over the eras the batch leaves STANDING (the calendar it
leaves behind); where a batch retires no era they are one window over one
sequence.

**The coverage rule was DELETED (developer ruling 2026-08-11), and the argument
is recorded because this module could re-derive it.**  It refused any write
that moved a day from COVERED to UNCOVERED underneath a SETTLED row filed in a
surviving period, and it was approved on the claim that stranding such a day
reproduces ``balance:N-128`` -- the two halves of the cash period view
disagreeing.  **That claim was false, and it was the whole of the case for the
rule.**  ``_cash_periods._assemble_figures`` values each column at that
period's OWN ``end_date`` and computes ``period_timing`` as ``moved - net``, so
a settle day past the last reported end is absent from BOTH sides of ruling
R-K's identity and cancels.  The money reports as a timing remainder -- the row
ruling R-DH split out to carry precisely this -- and the balance is right
either way: on that end date the bank had genuinely not taken it.  Pinned by
``test_cash_period_view.py``'s
``test_a_settle_day_past_the_window_keeps_every_column_exact``, and driven on a
production CLONE: retiring 58 of 61 periods strands three real rows totalling
``$177.47`` and every surviving column reconciles to the cent.

**Two things that are NOT evidence for it, stated because the first draft of
this paragraph offered both.**  Production has never been in the refused state
-- **0** settled rows fall outside its schedule's coverage -- so production is
silent on this rule rather than supporting its removal.  What production shows
is the DESIGN it rests on: 21 of 160 settled rows settle outside their OWN
paycheck (measured 2026-08-11), carried by the remainder with nothing refusing.
And the refusal's message offered THREE remedies, not one -- re-date the row,
move it, or choose a schedule that still covers the day.  The first two falsify
when money moved; the third is declining the edit.  **The measured COST is what
decided it**: 5 of the owner's 61 truncation points refused, one over three
rows that cleared the bank ONE day late.

**"Outside the reported window" is not a windowing nicety on the load-bearing
surface**: ``routes/grid/page.py`` passes the owner's COMPLETE period set, so there
the phrase means "outside every paycheck they have".  The identity holds all
the same -- it is a property of where each column is valued, not of how the
window was chosen -- but the reassurance must not be read as "only a partial
view sees this".

Flask-isolated: takes and returns plain data, never imports ``request`` /
``session``.  Raises :class:`~app.exceptions.ValidationError`, the form error
each refusal actually is, so the route that took the input renders it.

    really paid 2025-12-31, because payroll moved the 2026-01-01 nominal day
    back, typed 2025-12-31 -- which is what the sign-up form asked for -- and

    which bounded a batch on ``max(end_date)`` -- a derived column plan step
    C4-c dropped, and one that made the guard do a second job nothing credited
    it with.

    That second job is this function's ONLY job: **keeping plan step C6 closed.**
    Under the derivation a gap and an overlap are not expressible -- consecutive
    paydays define adjacent intervals -- so there is nothing left here to refuse
    except a payday landing INSIDE an existing paycheck, which splits it.  C6
    owns that, behind two questions ledger row **P10** records as unruled: what
    happens to a row ``DerivedPeriod.attribution_day`` would now clamp into the
    wrong half,
    and whether the split-off payday is repopulated (a monthly billed twice) or
    left empty (income understated for the whole horizon).  **When C6 answers
    them, this function is what it deletes.**

    **The floor is WHERE THE LAST PAYCHECK ENDS, and since plan step C14-d it
    asks the derivation rather than restating it.**  It is
    ``payday_after(stored_eras, latest_payday)`` -- the same call
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.derive_periods` makes to close the last
    saved period, whose ``end_date`` is that day minus one.  So the first day

    and the two cannot come apart.  Since plan step ``C17-b-2`` that day is
    the next payday of the ERA grid after the one the latest record stands
    for, anchored on the era's phase rather than stepped from the record.

    *That was a maintained agreement until C14-d, and the docstring said so:
    "on any schedule this app can write those two spellings select the same
    set, because the last period's end IS ``payday + cadence - 1``".  A rule
    that two places must always agree is rule 14's tell -- one value with two
    homes -- and the remedy is to delete a home rather than keep them in step.
    The home deleted here is this function's own ``latest_payday +
    cadence_days``, one of the five spellings*
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.projected_payday` *censuses -- and this
    module held TWO of them:* :func:`requested_paydays` *routed to the grid
    producer in the same step, and to the PROJECTION at ``C14-e-3``, so two of
    the five went and the census now names one.*

    **``C14-d`` moved ``$0.00`` and this fence now MOVES MONEY, which is
    ``C14-e-3``.**  That step's own ``$0.00`` was structural rather than a fact
    about stored data -- an adversarial review corrected a first draft resting
    it on every row holding ``none``, which any owner can falsify in one POST
    through the four doors ``C14-b`` shipped -- because
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.projected_payday` took no convention and
    nothing in the pay-calendar package read one.  It reads one now, so the
    floor below is a DISPLACED day for any owner who has answered the question.

    **What the change buys is measured, not asserted** (probe over production's
    own schedule, 1,951 paydays from 2026-03-26 at cadence 14 out to
    ``CALENDAR_DATE_MAX``, 2026-09-05).  Both spellings refuse the same **0**
    paydays with the convention at ``none``.  Under ``prior`` the open-coded
    floor refuses **58** of the owner's own future paydays -- the R-PC47 case
    exactly: a payday nominally
    2026-01-01 is really paid 2025-12-31, and ``latest + cadence`` puts the
    floor on the nominal day and refuses the real one -- and the producer call
    refuses **0**.

    **The floor reads the STORED eras, an obligation written down by an
    adversarial review of ``C14-d``, MOVED by ``C14-e-1`` without being
    gradable, and GRADED at ``C14-e-3``.**  The floor reads the stored eras
    and not the batch's own
    :attr:`Rhythm.shift <app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm.shift>`.  The
    argument's rhythm is what the operation LEAVES BEHIND, and a batch that
    changes the convention would otherwise compute its floor under the new one
    while :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.derive_periods` still closes the
    existing calendar under the old -- the disagreement between fence and
    boundary ``C14-d`` exists to end, reintroduced through the argument list.

    **Nothing could grade that until ``C14-e-3``, which is why it stayed an
    obligation for two steps.**  While
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.projected_payday` returned the nominal
    grid day the stored convention and the batch's own selected the SAME floor,
    so no test could tell this function from one reading the wrong half -- and
    an obligation marked discharged with nothing grading it is worse than one
    left open, because the next reader stops looking.  With the displacement
    live the two part company, and
    ``TestTheFloorReadsTheSTOREDConventionAndNotTheBatchS`` lands both
    directions: stored ``prior`` with an incoming ``next`` must ACCEPT a payday
    on 2030-11-27 (reading the batch's half refuses a day the owner was really
    paid), and stored ``next`` with an incoming ``prior`` must REFUSE it
    (reading the batch's half splits a paycheck they already hold).

    **Under ``next`` it still refused those 58 until ``C17-b-2``**, ledger
    row **N-495**: the ANCHOR was the last RECORDED payday, so a payday
    payroll moved forward carried its whole projection forward with it, and
    the floor inherited exactly the error the derived end had -- the point of
    asking the producer being that the fence cannot be wrong in a way the
    calendar is not.  The anchor is the era's phase now, at both.

    **Why it is not two days, and an adversarial review of C3-b is why.**  That
    step's first cut bounded at ``latest_payday +
    MIN_MATERIALISABLE_CADENCE_DAYS``, on the reasoning that the only insert
    worth refusing is one before an existing payday.  That is wrong by the
    length of a paycheck, and P10's BOTH damage arms are then reachable through
    a door P10 says is closed.  Measured on the two-period fortnightly
    schedule: recording 2026-01-23 shrank the 2026-01-16 paycheck from 01-29 to
    01-22 and moved a row due 01-25 from rendering on 01-25 to rendering on
    01-22, while ``/pay-periods/generate`` left the split-off half EMPTY and

    **It binds at EVERY batch with a survivor, whichever door sent it**
    (ruling **R-PC76**, 2026-09-12).  ``regenerate`` is the door that states
    a start beside a kept record; registration, first-time generate and reset
    have no survivor; and the continue path (extend, the rolling top-up)
    continues the plan.  Ledger row P80 exists because this class of
    constraint was once written per door, so it lives here, asked by the one
    writer, and a future door that keeps a prefix and states a start inherits
    it without its author remembering.  The test tree pays for that
    totality: a fixture that needs a hole (a 2026 block beside a 2024 opening
    payday) builds it through a helper that writes the rows directly, the
    state the tree's own predicate reserves for "a row no application door
    can write".

    **The continue path cannot reach it, since plan step ``C17-c-2b``.**
    Between ``C17-c-2a`` and that step one continue-path state did, and it
    was stated rather than absorbed (``C17-c-2a``'s adversarial review):
    ``pay_period_admin.extend_pay_periods`` restated the LATEST era from the
    horizon (ledger row **PC-509**), so for an owner truncated below a later
    era whose cadence was LONGER than the kept one's -- a weekly era from
    01-02, a 30-day era at 01-30, the record cut to 01-16 -- the top-up
    offered 01-30 at 30 days, skipping the weekly 01-23, and met this
    refusal from ``/grid`` with no handler.  ``C17-c-2b`` made the door
    record the plan's own paydays (01-23, then 01-30) through
    ``pay_period_write.continue_paydays``, a prefix of the sequence this
    function reads, so it is neither asked of that batch nor able to fire on
    it; the two steps deployed together.

    **It replaced ``pay_period_gates.reject_unconfirmed_gap``,
    ``PayPeriodGapRequired``, ``confirm_gap`` and the settings banner**,
    which asked the owner to CONFIRM the hole (plan step ``C14-f``, ruling
    **R-PC64**) and were deleted whole: a confirmed gap was still a gap, and
    the reference that gate graded from -- where the RETIRED tail used to
    open -- was the record rather than the plan, so a batch retiring nothing
    was not graded at all.  The ceiling here reads the plan
    (:func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.planned_paydays_after`, the sequence
    the floor's day is the first of).  Five weeks of unpaid leave is not a
    state this refuses the owner from recording -- it is an ``unpaid`` era
    KIND, which R-PC67 named the honest model of unemployment and deferred
    until asked for.

    **It reads the eras the batch leaves STANDING, not the stored ones**, and
    this step's adversarial review is why.  A rebuild retires every era whose
    first payday falls past the last kept payday, and a retired era takes its
    plan with it: fortnightly from 01-02 with a 30-day era minted at 01-30,
    then a fortnightly rebuild from 02-20 retiring that era, is a 35-day
    01-16 paycheck with two fortnightly paydays missing -- accepted against
    the stored plan (whose second payday was the 30-day era's 03-01), and the
    same batch from 02-06 was refused against it where the kept rhythm's own
    window ``[01-30, 02-13)`` admits it.  The floor keeps the stored eras,
    because its question is where the paycheck the owner HAS ends, which is
    the calendar as it derives before the batch.

    Args:

            any that exist.  Its earliest is what may skip: a batch whose
            first requested day the record already holds continues the plan
            from there, and every day it adds is on that plan.
        standing_eras: The eras the batch leaves STANDING -- those with a
            surviving payday, and the earliest whenever any payday survives
            (:func:`~app.services.pay_era_write.eras_describing`) -- whose
            plan is the calendar the batch leaves behind.  Empty only beside
            an empty payday set, by that function's contract.

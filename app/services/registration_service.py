"""
Shekel Budget App -- Registration: one sign-up builds a whole owner.

Everything a new owner needs before they can be shown a screen: the ``User``
row and its settings, the REAL pay calendar they stated, a baseline scenario,
the default Checking account, the category tree and the tax reference data.
:func:`register_user` is the one door, and
:class:`RegistrationSpec` is what a sign-up says.

**Why it is a module of its own, and it is plan step ``pay_calendar:C14-e-3``
that forced the question** (developer, 2026-09-06).  This lived in
:mod:`app.services.auth_service`, which is now two subjects in one file: an
IDENTITY tier -- hashing, verification, the HIBP breach check, the lockout
counters, ``authenticate`` and ``change_password`` -- and this one, which
builds an owner's whole financial baseline and touches eight tables.  The two
share nothing but :func:`~app.services.auth_service.hash_password`, which this
module imports and nothing here is imported back.

**The pressure that surfaced it was the pylint ceiling and the pressure is not
the reason.**  ``auth_service.py`` stood at 971 lines of a 1,000-line maximum
when ``C14-e-3`` had to widen the sign-up payday refusal, and ledger row
**pay_calendar:PC-498** says the remedy for that ceiling is a SPLIT and not a
trim -- a trim deletes argument, which is how the file came to be full.  Four
placements were costed and the developer took this one over moving the single
refusal to :mod:`app.services.pay_schedule_service`, over raising the ceiling,
and over trimming: the ceiling is a forcing function that had by then caught
over-writing twice in one arc, and the split is a DISTINCTION -- who you are
against what you own -- rather than a filing decision made to fit.

**The refusals are asked HERE, before the ``User`` row exists**, which is
:func:`register_user`'s standing property: a validation that fired later would
leave a partly-built owner in the session.  Four of the five belong to
:mod:`app.services.pay_schedule_service` and one,
:func:`_reject_impossible_first_payday`, belongs to this module because
registration is the only door that asks *which day were you last paid* against
a clock.

Pure of Flask: it takes a value object and returns a ``User``.  The session is
:mod:`app.extensions`' and the caller commits.

    """Refuse a sign-up payday the owner could not have been LAST paid on.

    Registration asks for the owner's MOST RECENT payday, and the rule is one
    sentence: **the paycheck that payday opens must still be running.**  That
    is what makes the rest of registration work with no second step -- sign-up
    day falls inside period 0, so the default account's opening assertion,
    dated today, has a real paycheck to post its correction into rather than
    reaching
    :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period`'s clamp.

    Each end refuses for its own reason.  A payday whose money has not landed
    is not one that has happened; a paycheck that has already ENDED means a
    later payday arrived that the owner did not name.

    **It asks the DERIVATION where that paycheck runs, and that is plan step
    ``pay_calendar:C14-e-3``.**  The rule was arithmetic here --
    ``[first_payday, first_payday + cadence_days - 1]``, accepting
    ``[today - cadence_days + 1, today]`` -- one of the spellings
    :func:`~app.services.pay_calendar.projected_payday`'s census names, agreeing
    with the derivation only while no payday could move.  Same repair ``C14-d``
    made to ``pay_period_batch.reject_backward_payday``.  What the old
    spelling cost is measured in that step's own entry.

    **The lower refusal's message is deliberately about the paycheck, not about
    the owner's arithmetic.**  It read "one of the two does not match the
    other" until an adversarial review of plan step X-ad-a found a user whose
    two answers match perfectly: on payday itself, before the deposit posts,
    "the day money landed" is honestly one cadence ago.  The form's wording was
    the real defect and it was fixed there.

    Args:
        first_payday: The stated most recent payday, read as a day on the
            owner's NOMINAL grid -- the same reading
            ``pay_period_batch.requested_paydays`` gives it, since this value
            becomes both the batch's phase and the first era's
            ``effective_from`` (plan step ``pay_calendar:C17-a``).
        rhythm: The stated cadence and payday convention
            (:class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm`).  ``register_user`` asks
            ``reject_out_of_range_cadence`` and ``reject_shift_on_short_cadence``
            of it BEFORE this, so neither producer call below can be handed an
            out-of-range question.
        today: The owner's civil today, read once by the caller so this bound
            and the opening assertion's day cannot straddle midnight.

    Returns:
        The day the schedule will RECORD -- *first_payday* displaced under
        *rhythm*'s convention, resolved here and threaded to the next refusal

class RegistrationSpec:
    """Everything one sign-up states: an identity, and a real pay calendar.

    **The pay-calendar half is plan step X-ad-a** (ruling **R-DB**, and the
    cross-arc fork ruled to it on 2026-08-09).  Registration used to FABRICATE
    a pay period covering ``[today, today + 13]`` because
    :func:`app.services.account_service.create_account` refuses an owner with
    no pay period -- and that invented payday is what then blocked the owner's
    real one: the forward-only batch guard of the day
    (``pay_period_service._reject_overlapping_batch``, replaced at plan step
    C3-b by ``pay_period_write._reject_backward_payday``, now
    ``pay_period_batch.reject_backward_payday``) refused any batch
    starting on or before the latest existing ``end_date``, so ``today + 1``
    through ``today + 13`` were REFUSED outright and every date from
    ``today + 14`` on left a permanent hole in the calendar (finding
    **N-123**).  The remedy is not a better guess: it is to ask.

    Frozen, so a constructed spec is an immutable record of one sign-up
    request, and modelled on
    :class:`app.services.account_service.AccountSpec` for the same reason --
    seven co-loaded values are one concept, not a keyword list.

    **No field carries a default, deliberately.**  ``first_payday`` has no
    defensible one, and giving the other two a default here would put a second
    copy of the app's biweekly premise below the one place that states it
    (``BaseConfig.DEFAULT_PAY_CADENCE_DAYS`` / ``DEFAULT_PAY_PERIOD_HORIZON``,
    applied by the Marshmallow layer and by ``scripts/seed_user.py``).  This
    module reads no Flask config by design -- see the module docstring.
    **That holds for ``history_opens_on`` too, and it is the field where the
    rule is least obvious**: ``None`` is its commonest value and would look
    like a harmless default.  It is now the SAFE reading -- not stated, so
    count only the record -- but a caller still has to reach it deliberately,
    because the field is the difference between an owner who answered and one
    who was never asked.

    Attributes:
        email: The user's email address.  Stripped and lowercased by
            :func:`register_user`, which also re-validates its shape.
        password: The plaintext password (12 characters minimum, 72 UTF-8
            bytes maximum -- bcrypt's hard input cap).
        display_name: The user's display name; stripped, and required to be
            non-empty after stripping.
        first_payday: The day the owner was LAST paid, which opens their
            schedule.  **Last, never next**, and that is the 2026-08-09
            ruling: an answer whose PAYCHECK still covers sign-up day has
            nothing to overlap on an empty calendar, so the default account's
            opening balance has a paycheck to post into and the owner needs no
            second step.  A NEXT payday would leave sign-up day uncovered and
            the opening correction would reach
            :meth:`~app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period`'s
            clamp.  *The window was spelled ``[today - cadence_days + 1,
            today]`` here until ``pay_calendar:C14-e-3``, arithmetic the
            derivation stopped agreeing with once a payday can move;
            :func:`_reject_impossible_first_payday` owns the rule.*
        rhythm: How often the owner is paid and what their payroll does when
            a payday lands on a weekend or a federal holiday
            (:class:`~app.services.pay_rhythm.Rhythm`).  Persisted
            as the owner's schedule, so extend and the rolling top-up have
            both halves to continue from.  *They used to infer a cadence where
            it was absent -- pay-calendar finding **P8** -- which plan step
            C4-b-2 closed by making the absence unstorable.*  It arrives as
            the PAIR rather than as two fields since plan step **C14-b**
            (ruling **R-PC56**: the convention is asked wherever a cadence
            is), because the two carry a joint rule: a convention that
            displaces a payday needs a cadence longer than the longest run of
            closed days, which
            :func:`~app.services.pay_schedule_service.reject_shift_on_short_cadence`
            refuses in :func:`register_user`'s up-front block.  Neither half
            has a default, and the rule is sharpest for the convention:
            ``NONE`` is both the commonest answer and the value that means
            *nobody has told us*, so a default would state as fact what no
            owner was asked -- the error ruling ``balance:R-IF`` was written
            to correct.
        num_periods: How many periods to generate forward from
            *first_payday*.
        history_opens_on: How far back the owner's paychecks reach, or ``None``
            for NOT STATED, which counts only the recorded paydays (plan step
            **balance:X-bh-2**, ruling **balance:R-IA** as amended
            2026-08-31).  The FLOOR on the
            backward payday rhythm the paycheck engine counts a month position
            and a year-to-date over.  It may not fall after *first_payday*:
            paychecks cannot have begun after the most recent one.  Asked here
            because the app knows the CADENCE and cannot derive when a job
            began, and asked at SIGN-UP because the form is already asking the
            other two halves of the same rhythm.

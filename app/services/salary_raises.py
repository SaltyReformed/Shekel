"""How a salary RAISE changes what a paycheck pays, and when it is an event.

Split out of :mod:`app.services.paycheck_calculator` at plan step **R-F16**,
which is the step that pushed that module past its 1000-line ceiling.  The
split is by CONCERN rather than by line count: applying raises is a rule about
``salary.salary_raises`` rows that two unrelated engines consume -- the
paycheck pipeline (:func:`~app.services.paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck`
/ ``project_salary``) and, until plan step salary:X-av-3a, the pension salary
projection, which reads the paycheck pipeline's own walk since.  It computes
no paycheck and reads no cadence -- a flat raise's paychecks a year is its
caller's argument -- so it never belonged to the engine's own file.

Pure: plain inputs, plain outputs, no Flask, no ORM, no clock, no database.

**A raise compounds on a PER-PAYCHECK pay since plan step salary:X-av-3a**
(rulings **R-SAL59**, **R-SAL60** and **R-SAL65**).  ``apply_raises`` walked
an ANNUAL salary through every application and rounded once at the end; the
salary's stored fact is what one paycheck pays now
(:class:`~app.models.salary_pay_entry.SalaryPayEntry`), so the walk lives in
:meth:`~app.services.payroll_basis.PayrollBasis.base_pay_on`, which reads the
two halves stated here: WHICH applications land between two days
(:func:`applications_between`) and what ONE application does to a paycheck's
pay (:func:`raise_pay`), each rounding to the cent the way a stub prints it.
The pension projection reads the same walk, so there is one.

**Every caller passes real ``SalaryRaise`` rows as of plan step salary:S3-c,
and the ENGINE passes :class:`RaiseTerms` values as of salary:S3-f-1.**  The
``raises`` argument was duck-typed so the pension projector could extrapolate
over FABRICATED values (deep-hunt #83) -- it built a ``TerminatedRaise`` per
row to carry a terminal year invented from
``auth.user_settings.merit_raise_horizon_years``.  Ruling **R-SAL11** made
that year a stored column on the row, so the fabrication, the value class it
produced and the setting it read are all deleted; the reads below are plain
attribute access rather than defended lookups.  The duck typing itself is
KEPT, and ruling **R-SAL20** is why: :attr:`~app.services.payroll_basis
.PayrollBasis.raises` is the profile's rows' terms unless a caller supplies
other terms, and a what-if over one raise's end year (plan step
**salary:S3-f**) arrives as :class:`RaiseTerms` carrying a row's terms with
that one changed.  That is an INPUT the owner typed for one request, with the
row still the one home of the stored fact -- not a second home computed from a
global on every render, which is what S3-c deleted.

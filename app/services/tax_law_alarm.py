Shekel Budget App -- Tax Law Alarm

**Is the tax law the app carries complete for the year a date calls for?**
ONE pure check (ruling **salary:R-SAL74**, plan step **salary:X-at-4**) that
every alarm reads, so no two alarms can disagree about which year is missing:

* the banner on every owner page, from November 1 (:data:`Stage.NOTICE`;
  ruling **R-SAL87** put it on every page), ``app/__init__.py`` and
  ``templates/_tax_law_notice.html``;
* the weekly scheduled GitHub run, failing from November 1, and from December 1
  (:data:`Stage.REFUSE`) the refusal: the ``tax-law`` job in ``ci.yml`` on
  every pull request, and the same check before ``docker-publish.yml`` builds
  the release image, so a pull request checked green in November cannot ship
  one after it and neither can a tag -- all three through
  ``scripts/check_tax_law.py``.

**Why alarms, and why here.**  The law is one copy in the code
(:mod:`app.tax_law`), so a new year arrives only in a release that adds it.
Nothing prices a missing year as missing:
:func:`~app.services.tax_config_service.resolve_tax_year` answers a year the
law lacks with the latest earlier year's rules (ruling **R-SAL76**), which is
the right answer to "what should this paycheck cost?" and the wrong one to
"has anyone added next year?".  Forgetting is silent by construction, so this
check makes it loud.

**What "complete" means (ruling R-SAL86).**  A year is in when the law carries
it and it lists every state an earlier year lists: a state, once supported,
is supported in every later year.  Federal rules and FICA need no check here,
because :class:`app.tax_law.TaxYearLaw` refuses a year without them and
:class:`app.tax_law.TaxLaw` refuses a skipped year, so a year the law carries
has both.  A year MAY ship in parts -- federal before a state that publishes
later -- and every alarm keeps naming the missing state until it lands.

**One reading this module adds, which the ruling does not state:** a state
first listed in a later year owes nothing to the years before it, so adding a
state never raises an alarm about the past.  A profile in that state is priced
for those earlier years on the state's first listed year (the resolver's
forward reach, :func:`~app.services.tax_config_service.resolve_tax_year`);
plan step salary:X-at-3, which decides the supported states, is where that is
asked.

The check reads no clock: every caller passes the day it means, which is what
lets the tests drive it to any date.  What keeps the weekly calendar sweep's
faked clock away from the GitHub alarms is that the script runs outside
pytest and reads the real one; the in-app banner, rendered inside the suite,
does move with the sweep's date.

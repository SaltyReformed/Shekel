"""The ONE replay of a loan's event stream: charges accumulate, payments clear.

Plan step **X-au-g-2c-3b-2**.  Every walk over a loan answers the same question
in the same way -- *time charges the loan, cash covers what is charged, and the
remainder pays the debt down* -- and until this step the application stated that
rule TWICE:

* the SETTLED walk (:func:`.._walk.walk_loan_ledger`), which replays a loan's
  anchors and its real payments, and
* the FORWARD fold (``balance_at._plan_fold._split_plan``), which replays the
  projected plan.

They were not copies of each other by choice.  ``balance_at`` has an import
closure of 50 modules and reaches ``loan_ledger`` (closure 23) -- both figures
measured 2026-09-02, and worth re-measuring before either is quoted again -- so
the arrow runs one way and the seam could not hand its fold down.  *The DIRECTION
is what the argument needs and it is checkable in a line:* no module under
``loan_ledger`` imports ``balance_at``, and ``_plan_fold`` imports
``loan_ledger``.  **That is the third time this
arc has found one rule duplicated because it sat on the wrong side of the import
graph** -- the ALLOCATION at plan step X-au-g-2c-3a, the CHARGE CALENDAR at
X-au-g-2c-3b-1, and now the REPLAY that consumes them both -- which is what
argues the shape is structural rather than incidental.  The remedy is the same
one each time: put the rule at the tier every walk can reach.

## The rule, in full

```text
balance := seed
standing := (interest 0.00, escrow 0.00, extra 0.00)

CHARGE   (a period began)  on or before the loan's first tracking start,
                                            clear standing first (R-R117)
                           balance <= 0  -> nothing accrues, nothing impounds
                           otherwise     -> standing += (accrue(balance, rate),
                                                         escrow, extra_per_period)
PAYMENT  (cash arrived)    allocate cash + standing.extra against standing,
                           advance the balance, and clear standing
RESET    (an assertion)    record the balance just before, overwrite it, and
                           clear standing (R-R72 part (2)) -- save the loan's
                           first tracking start, with no Record balance on
                           its day and the standing installment's own payment
                           still to walk, which charges that installment
                           again on the balance it states (R-R118)
```

**Fused, the CHARGE and the PAYMENT made the payment COUNT the clock** (plan step
R16-a): while a month's interest was charged inside the per-payment step, N
payments inside one month charged N months.  Measured on a production clone, 30
payments of ``$531.94`` fourteen days apart charged the identical ``$1,096.34``
as 30 a month apart, split for split.  Separated, a second payment inside one
accrual period arrives with nothing standing and pays pure principal.

**A RESET clears whatever charges stand before it** (ruling **R-R72** part (2),
applied at plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1**): "the balance on this date is X"
supersedes every earlier month, interest owed included, so the standing
interest, escrow and hypothetical extra are zeroed with the balance overwritten.
The arm was UNREACHABLE until plan step **recurrence:R16-c-2**, when every
contractual installment from origination began to be charged
(:func:`.._charges.contract_charges`): a month nobody paid now leaves its
charge standing when a later assertion arrives -- a pre-tracking month of a
loan configured mid-life, cleared by its tracking start (when that start is
the loan's first balance, only the last month before it still stands when it
lands: see the next paragraph).

**A loan's FIRST tracking start clears the months before it one by one**
(ruling **R-R117**).  Clearing only when the reset walks is too late for a
payment the start holds -- one due before it and marked paid after it: that
payment walks first, by its due date, and paid every unrecorded month since
origination, arrears first, as its interest.  So when the loan's first
balance after its opening is a tracking start, each charge dated on or before
it REPLACES what stands (:func:`_first_tracking_start`): a month before the
start is paid for only by a payment of its own, and the months after it are
charged as ever.  A true-up (a Record balance), and a tracking start dated
after another balance, keep the reset's own clearing alone.

**That start charges the month it lands in on its OWN figure when that
month's payment walks after it** (ruling **R-R118**).  A payment due off the
contractual day, after the start but inside the interval of the installment
standing when the start walks, walks after the start; the start's own
clearing alone would leave it nothing to pay, so it would pay pure principal
(finding **REC-555**).  The ruling's "lender's day" design (the REC-552
study's option A*) walks the start before that installment's charge, so the
installment accrues on the start's figure.  So when no payment has walked
since the standing charge, and the next event after the start that is a
charge or a payment is a payment (:func:`_flag_recharging_starts`), the
start re-charges that installment on the balance it states
(:func:`_accrued`, the charge arm's own accrual).  The start's displaced
balance does not move, since a charge never touches the balance.  A second
payment inside the interval, after one walked before the start, clears
nothing fresh and pays pure principal, as any second payment does.  Any
other balance keeps R-R72 part (2) ("a Record balance in the same place
keeps your Sept 11 rule", in the ruling's words), and the start re-charges
nothing when a true-up shares its day, whichever of the two the loader
orders first: the design walks a Record balance at its own date, after the
standing charge, so it clears what stands, and the interval's payment
after it pays pure principal, as the ruling's "as the 'lender's day'
design does" requires.  **One residual on that day, not this ruling's:**
the design also walks the start BEFORE the charge, so the Record balance
always closes the day, where the loader closes it on whichever statement
was recorded later (plan step X-an-b's chronology, finding N-196,
:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.load_loan_anchor_facts`; unchanged).  A
Record balance of $25,000.00 recorded before a start of $24,604.17 on the
same day leaves $24,104.17 after the example's $500.00; the design would
leave $24,500.00.

**One stream, PAST and FUTURE** (plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1**, rulings
**R-R90** and **R-R72**).  The stream carries the loan's recorded FACTS -- its
assertions and its settled payments -- and, after them, its PROJECTION: the
payments it has not yet made (:attr:`LoanEventStream.projections`).  Since plan
step **recurrence:R16-c-2** it carries ONE list of charges, the contract's
installments from origination through its LAST event
(:func:`with_contract_charges`, ruling **R-R100**); until then the plan raised
a second list of its own against its projections.  **A projected payment is
never placed before a recorded fact.**  Its walk key is ``max(on_date,
boundary)`` where the boundary is the day after the loan's latest recorded
payment or assertion (:func:`projection_boundary`); payments pushed to the
boundary keep their order among themselves by their OWN date, and no event's
``on_date`` is rewritten.  A charge is never pushed: an installment dated
before the boundary is part of the facts' own calendar, so a month skipped
behind a later settled payment is cleared by THAT payment -- arrears first,
exactly what the servicer's books say, save a month on or before the loan's
first tracking start, which that start drops (ruling R-R117, above) -- and
the overdue catch-up behind it
pays what then stands.  So the splits of the recorded facts are a function of
the facts ALONE, whether or not a projection follows them.  That is what lets
the posted ledger (which replays the facts and nothing else) and a screen
(which replays the facts and then the plan) agree to the cent on every
recorded payment: the fact prefix of both replays is the same list in the same
order.  The hypothetical ``extra_per_period`` joins the cash at the charges on
or after the boundary only -- "an extra $100 a month" is money the owner has
not paid yet, so it never reprices a recorded month.

    closed loan's refund, so a what-if search would report an ``excess`` inflated

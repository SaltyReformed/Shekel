"""A loan's CONTRACT terms, loaded once per read pass for every reader in it.

The ONE producer of a loan's :class:`._charges.LoanCalendar` from its stored
rows (:func:`build_loan_calendar`), and the per-pass memo that hands the SAME
instance to the two readers a pass has (:class:`LoanCalendars`): the walk,
whose charges are built from it (:func:`._walk.load_loan_stream`), and the cash
price of a derive-mode loan payment
(:class:`app.services.cash_ledger.LoanPricing`).

**Pricing kept a second bundle of these terms until plan step
recurrence:R25** (ruling **R-R105**: "one bundle that pricing and charging
both read"; finding **REC-545**).  ``cash_ledger._loan_installment``'s
``_LoanCashBasis`` held the rate periods, the due day and the origination, and
``LoanPricing`` the escrow lines beside it -- the identical four facts this
module's calendar holds, each loaded by its own path, so a pass that walked a
derive-mode loan and priced its payments resolved the loan's terms twice
(measured on a production copy 2026-10-08: rate periods, params and escrow
lines each loaded twice for one balance read).  The bundle is deleted; both
readers take this memo's calendar.

**The memo holds the PARAMS too**, because the walk needs them beyond the
calendar (its opening assertion is synthesized from them,
:func:`app.services.loan_loaders.load_loan_anchor_facts`), and loading them
once per pass for both is what keeps the walk at the one params load it made
before.  The loan resolver's bundle and the payoff calculator still load the
params and resolve the terms on their own paths inside one pass; that is
finding **REC-559**, owned by plan step recurrence:R16-f, after which every
reader takes this memo.

**A memo on the PASS, not a cache**: a write path that changes a loan's terms
and then re-renders builds a fresh pass, so there is no invalidation question
-- the convention :class:`app.services.balance_at.BalanceContext` states for
every memo it holds.  A reader holding no pass builds a fresh
:class:`LoanCalendars` for its one use.

"""The loan walk: ONE running-balance replay over ONE event stream -- FACTS.

The single chronological walk a loan's whole architecture derives from.  It
seeds the balance at zero and folds the loan's three kinds of fact
(:mod:`._events`) through the ONE replay (:mod:`._replay`): each accrual period
CHARGES the loan, each settled payment's cash ALLOCATES against what stands, and
each anchor RESETS the balance -- so the loan's opening, every true-up, and every
payment split come from ONE running balance and can never disagree on the balance
interest accrued on, the way three independent walks could.

**The walk yields FACTS, not a balance-at-T.**  Its output is a
:class:`LoanLedgerWalk` -- one :class:`~._replay.PaymentOutcome` per payment
and one :class:`LoanAnchorCorrection` per anchor, in CONTRACT-time order.
Turning those facts into "what is owed on date D" is the FOLD -- re-key each event
by the date it becomes VISIBLE (:func:`dated_deltas`, here since plan step E1a
because BOTH sides consume it), then prefix-sum the paydowns -- and the prefix-sum
lives in the balance seam (:mod:`app.services.balance_at._fold`) as of plan step
**D-fold**, not here.  A consumer holding a walk therefore cannot reach a balance
from a public leaf name, which is why the walk needs no fence (the sampling that
would turn the dated facts into money is seam-private).

**Two consumers, one walk.**  The posting writer
(:mod:`app.services.loan_posting_service`) projects this walk into the balanced
corrections it reconciles onto the general ledger; the seam's read pass folds it
into a balance at a date.  The walk is the leaf both depend on, which is what
makes the posted ledger a re-derivable projection of the loan's facts rather
than a second opinion about them.

**Takes no as-of, and reads no clock**: it walks the loan's FACTS and records
every one of them, whatever their date.  Its output is therefore a function of
the loan's data ALONE -- which is what makes it re-derivable -- and deciding
which facts have HAPPENED as of a date belongs to a reader (the seam's fold).  The
cash ledger's walk
(:func:`app.services.account_posting_service.walk_account_ledger`) has taken no
as-of since Step 3; the loan half caught up at step A3 (``4e46a0a8``).

**The same walk carries the loan's PROJECTIONS when the seam appends them**
(plan step **recurrence:R16-c-1**, ruling **R-R90**): :func:`replay_loan_stream`
is the pure replay over any :class:`~._replay.LoanEventStream`, and a stream
holding the forward plan's payments behind the recorded facts yields the loan's
WHOLE timeline from one seed, the origination.  Nothing above changes for the
posted ledger -- :func:`walk_loan_ledger` builds no projection, so its walk is
still the facts alone -- and a projection cannot alter a recorded payment's
split, because the replay never places one ahead of a fact
(:func:`._replay.projection_boundary`).

    drives the running balance to the anchor's verified value at the anchor's
    date, and the walk amortizes forward from there.  The posting writer turns
    each of these into a balanced correction: the opening anchor's is the loan's
    OPENING (its ``owed_before`` is zero, so it books ``-original_principal``
    onto the loan and ``+original_principal`` onto the loan's opening-equity
    account); a ``user_trueup`` anchor's is the append-only TRUE-UP that
    reproduces the resolver's balance jump without editing any prior posting.

    The correction's loan-linked leg is ``owed_before - anchor_balance`` (its
    equity leg the negative), so the two sum to zero and the ledger's implied
    ``owed`` moves from ``owed_before`` to ``anchor_balance``.  A correction whose

    * At an ANCHOR (opening or user-trueup): record a
      :class:`LoanAnchorCorrection` carrying the balance JUST BEFORE the reset,
      then reset the running balance to the anchor's verified value.  The opening
      anchor is always the first event, so its ``owed_before`` is zero.

    Resetting at EVERY anchor -- rather than seeding from the latest anchor only,

    reproduce the resolver penny-for-penny on a TRUED-UP loan: the pre-anchor

    The bridge from the walk (events ordered by when they HAPPENED, in CONTRACT

    contributes the amount it moved the running owed balance by:

    * an anchor: ``anchor_balance - owed_before`` -- the jump its reset booked;
    * a payment: ``-principal`` -- the debt its cash actually paid down.

    Negated, these are exactly the amounts the posting writer books onto the

    in either consumer:

    * the balance seam's fold prefix-sums the deltas and samples a date

    **The deltas are computed in EVENT (contract) order and then re-keyed by
    VISIBLE date, and that is deliberate.**  A payment's split depends on the
    balance at its installment, so the walk runs in due-date order
    (:func:`._replay.replay_loan_events`, over
    :func:`._events.loan_event_stream`); the ledger stores those
    amounts, and a reader counts whichever are visible.  Under the one clock a
    payment's visible date is its SETTLED date and an anchor's is its own date
    (:mod:`._visible`) -- the same day each posting carries in ``entry_date``
    -- so a late-settled payment's principal is shown from the day its cash
    moved, while its split stays fixed to the installment it paid.  A
    PROJECTION's is its effective day (``max(due, as_of + 1d)``, ruling D1),
    carried on its event by the seam that built it, so a walk holding the
    loan's plan dates its future paydowns here by the same rule and one
    prefix-sum values the whole timeline (plan step recurrence:R16-c-1).

    **Dated FACTS, not a balance-at-T** (the fence ruling): each pair says
    what ONE event contributed and when it counts -- amounts already readable
    off the public splits and corrections.  Turning them into "what is owed on
    date D" is the prefix-sum, which stays seam-private

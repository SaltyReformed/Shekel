"""The loan fold's EVENT STREAM: what happened to a loan, in the order it happened.

A loan's balance is a fold over its event stream, and this module builds that
stream.  THREE kinds of fact enter it, and nothing else:

* an **ASSERTION** -- the loan's opening (its origination, ALWAYS) plus every
  balance assertion made after it: a mid-life ``tracking_start`` and every user
  balance true-up, all loaded as
  :class:`~app.services.loan_loaders.LoanAnchorFact` and all RESETTING the running
  balance at their own date (a ``tracking_start`` is never the opening -- step C1);
* a **PAYMENT** -- the to-side leg of a settled transfer into the loan, its
  covering movement the record that cash actually moved
  (:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.settled_income_shadows`);
* a **CHARGE** -- what an accrual period cost the loan
  (:func:`.._charges.contract_charges`), one per CONTRACTUAL installment from
  origination (plan step recurrence:R16-c-2, ruling **R-R100**).  It joined the
  stream at plan step **X-au-g-2c-3b-2**, and it is the fact that stops the
  payment COUNT being the clock: while a month's interest and escrow rode on
  the payment RECORD, N payments inside one month charged N months.

**Every fact enters the stream, whatever its date, and nothing here reads the
clock.**  A loan's anchors are FACTS -- the origination is a verbatim copy of the
immutable :class:`~app.models.loan_params.LoanParams`, a true-up is the
operator's dated assertion -- and this module RECORDS them; deciding which have
HAPPENED as of a given date is a READER's job.  Dropping a future-dated anchor --
what the walk did while it took an ``as_of`` -- made the persisted ledger a
function of the wall clock at the moment the sync happened to run, which is a
corruption generator, not a cache (step A3, ``4e46a0a8``).

**What this module does NOT decide is the ORDER**, and that is plan step
X-au-g-2c-3b-2's division.  ``merge_anchor_and_payment_events`` lived here and
sorted the stream itself; the forward fold sorted its own, and the two were one
rule stated twice.  The order between KINDS is now
:func:`.._replay.replay_loan_events`'s alone, and the order WITHIN a kind is each
loader's, preserved by a stable sort.  What survives here is the mapping: which
rows are facts, which date governs each, and what figure each carries.

The one exception is :func:`confirmed_shadows_through`, which IS a reader's
bound and lives here only because it is the same settled-payment set narrowed:
see its docstring.  Since plan step recurrence:R16-c-1 it is also the payment
half of the pass's visibility bound (:func:`.._walk.load_loan_stream`).

    same postings by their ``entry_date``, which the writer stamps with that
    identical day.

            by it is a forward projection, excluded.
        payment_day: The loan's contractual day-of-month due day, for
            R-BAL139's day of a payment storing no ``due_date`` (see

    """Map a loan's anchors, settled payments and charges into ONE event stream.

    The settled walk's half of the replay: it says WHICH rows are facts, WHICH
    date governs each, and WHAT figure each carries.  The replay
    (:func:`.._replay.replay_loan_events`) then decides the order between kinds
    and folds them.

    **This is CONTRACT time, not cash time.**  A payment is dated by the
    installment it satisfies (its DUE date,
    :func:`app.services.loan_loaders.loan_payment_due_date`), never by when its
    cash settled, so a late or out-of-order settlement can never reorder
    installments or re-split one (ruling R-A).  That derivation is threaded onto
    the event rather than recomputed downstream (plan step E1c), and it is the
    SAME strict ``anchor_date < due_date`` post-anchor boundary the resolver's
    replay uses (:func:`is_confirmed_payment_eligible`, fed the same derivation
    via :attr:`~app.services.amortization_engine.PaymentDates.due_date`) -- the
    two MUST stay on one derivation,
    or the posted ledger and the replayed balance drift on which payments a given
    anchor subsumes.

    **The CHARGES are the CONTRACT's**, every installment from origination
    through the stream's last fact (:func:`.._replay.with_contract_charges`,
    plan step recurrence:R16-c-2, rulings **R-R72** and **R-R100**) -- which
    keeps plan step R16-a's rule, the count of charges cannot depend on the
    count of payments, and ends D53's exception to it: a month nobody paid is
    charged, and the next payment clears those arrears before it reaches
    principal.  A period holding two payments is charged once, and the second
    payment clears nothing fresh and pays pure principal.

    **EVERY input arrives PRE-ORDERED by its own loader, and nothing here or in
    the replay adds a TIE-BREAK WITHIN A KIND** (plan step X-an-b, closing finding
    N-196; the same shape finding N-133 / R1 ruled on the cash side).  A stable
    sort in the replay preserves each loader's key within a shared date -- anchors
    keep :func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.load_loan_anchor_facts`'
    ``(anchor_date, created_at, event_id)``, payments keep
    :func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.settled_income_shadows`'
    ``(pay_period.start_date, transfer id)``.  The stream was re-sorted on ``(anchor_date,
    created_at)`` until X-an-b, which was a SECOND statement of a rule the loader
    is now the one home of, and an incomplete one: ``created_at`` is evaluated at
    TRANSACTION START, so two anchors written together shared an instant, the
    re-sort left them in whatever order PostgreSQL returned, and the walk reset on
    the LAST of the tie while the resolver's ``max()`` seeded from the FIRST.

    Args:
        anchor_facts: The loan's :class:`~app.services.loan_loaders.LoanAnchorFact`

            where that order is decided).

            ``(pay_period.start_date, transfer id)``
            (:func:`~app.services.loan_loaders.settled_income_shadows`; the
            name is the shadow era's and goes at ``X-bi-6-4d``).  Each leg's
            cash is read through
            :func:`~app.services.row_valuation.leg_settled_contribution` -- the
            accessor whose NAME asserts the payment has SETTLED -- rather than
            a resolver, because every leg here has, so it answers from the
            settlement it RECORDED -- its covering movement -- and there is no
            plan to reach; a leg holding none is the ``$0.00`` record (ruling
            **R-BAL82**), a payment of nothing, never a fallback to a
            forecast, and a leg that has not settled at all REFUSES, which is
            what makes the loader's partition a precondition this replay
            states rather than merely relies on.
        calendar: The loan's contract terms
            (:class:`~.._charges.LoanCalendar`): its due day is the fallback
            coordinate for a payment whose transfer stores no ``due_date``
            (for its contract date and, for a ``$0.00`` close, its visible-on
            day, ruling **R-BAL139**), and each charge carries the rate period
            and the escrow in force on its own installment date.

    Returns:
        The loan's :class:`~._replay.LoanEventStream` -- its RECORDED facts.
        It carries no projection: the seam appends the forward plan's to a
        copy of this stream (``balance_at._loan_stream``) for a read, and the

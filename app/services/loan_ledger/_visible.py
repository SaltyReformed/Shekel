"""WHEN a loan event becomes visible to a balance read -- the ONE honest clock.

The fold reads a loan's SOURCE events, but the balance every screen shows is a
sum of POSTINGS, so the fold must count each event on the SAME day the posted
ledger does or the two would diverge (step B2's parallel run is an EQUALITY).
That day is the day the event HAPPENED, and it is already the day the posting
carries in ``journal_entries.entry_date``:

* a **PAYMENT** is visible from its **settled date** -- the STORED
  ``settled_on`` of the loan-side covering movement its leg carries as its
  record (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4b``; the shadow's own column until
  then, which the status seam keeps equal to its movement), read through the
  leg's own :attr:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg.settled_on` and
  refused when missing by the one refusal of a missing settle day,
  :func:`app.utils.balance_predicates.require_settled_day`, since leaf
  ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-1`` (through the row accessor
  :func:`~app.utils.balance_predicates.settled_day` until then).  It is the day
  the posting writer files the loan-side entry under (plan step
  ``balance:X-bi-6-3``) and the day the cash walk folds that movement on.  It
  is the LOAN side's own day (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``, ruling
  **R-BAL142**): the same date the checking outflow moves on while the loan
  side borrows checking's day, which is every payment with no evidence of its
  own on the loan side, so the loan and checking move together (ruling R-A);
  a loan side that holds its own day moves on that day, and the ledger holds
  the difference in Transfers-in-transit.  A payment that moved NO money -- a ``$0.00``
  close, whose leg carries no record -- is visible from the installment it
  skips (ruling **R-BAL139**): its INTERVAL's installment (ruling
  **R-R107**), the one the replay charges it against.

  **A payment that moved money has no derivation and no fallback left here,
  and that is plan step X-f1** (ruling R-EC).  It WAS the display-timezone
  civil date of the shadow's ``paid_at``, falling back to its pay period's
  ``start_date`` when the instant was NULL (the developer ruling of
  2026-07-17); the day is a stored fact now,
  and a settled payment whose record carries none is REFUSED rather than
  dated by a fallback.  R-BAL139's installment is not a fallback for a
  missing day: it is the day of a payment that has no movement to carry one
  (and one due before the loan's first installment keeps its own due date,
  having no installment to skip).

  **The zone moved from UTC to ``America/New_York`` at ruling R-DH (b)**
  (2026-07-31), together with the cash half, because a split zone is what pulls a
  transfer's two legs onto different days: a payment recorded at 20:38 Eastern is
  00:38 the NEXT day in UTC, so the checking outflow moved on the user's Monday
  while the loan principal fell on Tuesday.  That ruling is what the stored
  column now records directly.  Measured on production 2026-07-31, when the day
  was still derived: of 9 settled payment shadows exactly ONE was affected -- a
  ``$1,910.95`` mortgage payment stamped 2026-07-02 00:38:53 UTC, the evening of
  2026-07-01 Eastern and the last day of that pay period.
* an **ANCHOR** is visible from its **own civil date** (``anchor_date``) -- the one
  date it ever asserts, and the ``entry_date`` the anchor correction is posted at
  (:func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.emit_correction_entry`).

**This is step C2 -- the one clock that replaced the two boundary predicates the
old rule used.**  Before it, a payment counted from its pay period's ``start_date``
and an anchor from ``LEAST(anchor_date, containing period.start)`` -- both a
boundary predicate standing in for an instant, this codebase's signature defect
(``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md`` Section 8).  The anchor ``LEAST``
in particular made an anchor visible days EARLY, so a loan originating 2026-03-25
read its full $200,000.00 principal on 2026-03-20 (finding N-10).  Counting each
event on its own date closes that at the source: an anchor dated in the future is
simply not yet visible, and the four ``origination_date`` guards that contained
the leak are retired (N-10).

**The CALENDAR left this module at plan step C2-d, and with it the package's
last query.**  Three names lived here -- ``owner_pay_periods`` (the owner's
period list), ``find_period_containing_date`` (which period a date falls in)
and ``resolve_anchor_pay_period`` (the three-branch chain the anchor-posting
writers filed against, built on the other two).  Ruling **D5**'s one clock had
already taken the FOLD off them -- an anchor counts from its own date and needs
no calendar -- so the two posting writers were the only consumers left, and a
chronology rule neither of them shares with anything in this package was being
reached by an import from the CASH posting package into the LOAN package
(finding **N-169**).  The 2026-08-10 pay-calendar ruling replaced the chain
with one clamp on
:meth:`app.services.pay_calendar.PayCalendar.filing_period`, both writers now
take it through :func:`app.services._posting_reconcile.filing_calendar_for`,
and all three names are deleted.

**Chronology only, and now PURE.**  The two names left here each return a
``date``; neither yields a balance-at-T, which is why both are ruled
non-producers of the balance fence.  No clock, no writes and -- since C2-d
removed the one calendar query -- no database session anywhere in this package.
That also retires a caveat this paragraph used to carry: a returned
``PayPeriod`` was an ORM row, so money was reachable from it by relationship,
and the fence ruling had to say that a period is not an account's balance
rather than that a figure was unreachable.  Nothing here returns an ORM row any
more, so the stronger claim is now true by construction -- which is the shape to
prefer, because claiming it before it was true is how
``LoanState.current_balance`` shipped.

    """Return the date a settled payment's principal becomes visible to a read.

    Its **settled date** (step C2, ruling R-A): the STORED ``settled_on`` of
    the leg's record -- the loan-side covering movement -- read through the
    leg's own :attr:`~app.services.transfer_legs.TransferLeg.settled_on`.
    That movement is
    what the cash fold counts AND what the posting writer files the loan-side
    entry under (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-3``), so the day the fold counts
    this payment and the day the sum-of-postings reader counts it cannot
    drift.  It is the LOAN side's own day (plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-3``,
    ruling **R-BAL142**) -- the checking outflow's day while the loan side
    borrows it, its own day when it holds one.  It read the SHADOW's

    each shadow equal to its own movement (measured equal on all 20 settled
    income shadows of the 2026-09-23 21:17 production dump).

    **A leg with NO record is a ``$0.00`` close, and it is dated by the
    installment it skips** (ruling **R-BAL139**, extending **R-BAL90**: no
    transfer stores a day).  That installment is its INTERVAL's (ruling
    **R-R107**, amending R-BAL139): the latest installment due on or before the
    payment's own due date
    (:func:`~app.services.installment_calendar.installment_paid_by`), the same
    one answer to "which installment does this payment pay" that its charge,
    its cash price, the forward plan (ruling **R-R104**) and the loan page
    (rulings **R-R108**, **R-R109**) read.  Nothing moved on
    any day, so this is the day the debt grows by the charge the payment did
    not clear, and the ledger books that correction on it.  For a payment due
    ON the contractual day the interval's installment IS its due date
    (:func:`app.services.loan_loaders.loan_payment_due_date`); one due before
    the loan's first installment skips none and keeps its own due date.  Until
    X-bi-6-4b it was the settle day stated on the close, read off the shadow
    row that ``X-bi-6-4d`` deletes; from X-bi-6-4b until R-R107 it was the
    payment's own due date, which parts from its interval's installment for a
    payment due off the contractual day.

    **It DERIVED the day from ``paid_at`` until plan step X-f1** (ruling R-EC)
    -- a display-timezone conversion of the click instant with the pay period's
    ``start_date`` as a NULL fallback.  The column stores the day now, so this
    reads a fact; a record carrying none under a settled transfer is refused
    rather than dated by a fallback.  No door writes that state: a revert
    un-dates the movement and leaves the transfer unsettled, and a ``$0.00``
    re-close withdraws it (``status_seam._covering``).

    **The split MATH is untouched by the zone, and that is what bounds this
    rule's blast radius to one day of VISIBILITY.**  The interest / principal /
    escrow split, the governing rate version, and the anchor-versus-payment
    ordering all key on the DUE date
    (:func:`app.services.loan_ledger.loan_event_stream`,
    :mod:`app.services.loan_ledger._replay`) -- never on ``paid_at`` -- so a late or
    out-of-order settlement, and equally a re-zoned one, changes only WHEN the
    paid-down principal is shown, never HOW the payment splits, at what rate, or
    against which anchor.

    of a loan's assertions is later", and
    :func:`app.services.loan_loaders.load_loan_anchor_facts` sorts by the same
    function -- so the greatest element here IS the last element there, by
    construction rather than by two tuples agreeing.  That identity is what the

    it resets the running balance at each anchor in turn, so the anchor it
    reaches LAST must be the one this seeds from.  See that function for why all
    three terms are load-bearing; the third (``event_id``) is what plan step
    X-an-b added, closing finding **N-196**.

    **The bound is the WALK's, which takes no as-of, and NOT a reader's.**  This

    **It is deliberately order-INSENSITIVE where the walk is not.**  The walk
    calls the loader itself and consumes its order; this resolver is a pure leaf

    of its test call sites hand-build the list -- so it re-derives the greatest
    element rather than trusting a position.

    as a package export so the Build-Order Step 4 split walk
    (``loan_ledger.compute_loan_payment_splits``) could seed from the identical
    anchor.  Both were false when X-an-b measured them: that walk resets at
    EVERY anchor from a zero seed and has never called this, and the backref was
    a third, incomplete statement of the order with no reader at all -- X-an-b
    deleted its ``order_by`` rather than growing it an ``id`` term.  A first
    draft of the REPLACEMENT then claimed the two spellings were "pinned equal by
    a test, the same treatment ``cash_ledger.resolve_anchor`` and

    this replay reads three dates per payment and no amount, so taking the
    bundle made a caller that has only the dates unable to reach it -- which is
    what put the reconciliation oracle's amount-free reference on a 101-module
    import closure against the 45 its own arithmetic needs.  Its production
    caller passes ``[payment.dates for payment in loan_inputs.payments or []]``;
    the suite's un-seeded replays pass the loader's installment dates directly.

    Only settled payments reduce the balance.  An unconfirmed payment
    is a Projected transfer the user has not yet marked received; it is
    a future commitment, not historical fact (the forward projection picks it
    up via the override map).  **Nothing is filtered here to achieve that**:
    ``replay_schedule`` owns the anchor boundary AND the as-of cap, and that cap
    (:func:`~app.services.rate_period_engine.is_confirmed_payment_eligible` ->
    :func:`app.utils.dates.has_settled_by`) answers ``False`` for a payment
    carrying no settle day, so an unsettled payment is excluded by the same
    rule that excludes one settled after ``as_of``.  This function pre-filtered
    on ``settled_on is not None`` and projected onto a ``ConfirmedPayment``
    type until plan step **balance:X-bl-2b** measured the two to be one
    predicate; both were deleted rather than kept as a second statement of it

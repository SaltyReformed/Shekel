"""
Shekel Budget App -- Tax Config Service

Resolves which tax law prices a salary profile's paycheck in a given year,
for the paycheck calculator and the Taxes tab.  The law itself is
:mod:`app.tax_law` -- ONE copy, in the code (ruling **salary:R-SAL74**, plan
step **salary:X-at-1**); this module reads it and decides which of its years
applies.  Until X-at-1 it read a copy of the law stored per user in five
``salary`` tables, which signup and every deploy copied in and the Settings
page could overwrite.

**Which year's law applies to a given year is ONE rule and it lives here**
(:func:`resolve_tax_year`).  The app carries the years that have been
published -- 2025 and 2026 at X-at-1 -- while pay periods run ~2 years ahead,
so most projected periods ask for a year the law does not have yet.  Answering
that with "no law" is not an option: the paycheck engine reads a missing
``fica_config`` as zero Social Security
(:func:`~app.services.tax_calculator.capped_social_security`, which documents
that arm for bootstrap), so an unresolved year silently inflates net pay by the
whole SS line.

The rule this module used to apply was "fall back to the CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR",
and it had a cliff the day the current year is itself unconfigured -- which was
every New Year, for every user, because configuration was seeded per year and
nothing seeded the next one.  Measured on a clone of production 2026-08-11: on
2027-01-01, with no write and no user action, 40 of 51 live-priced salary rows
change and the projected income over the horizon rises by **$8,460.50** (period
22 goes from ``NET 2,639.30`` with ``ss 205.19`` to ``NET 2,844.49`` with
``ss 0.00``).  Counting the 11 periods the grid's own rolling top-up creates
that same day it is **$10,914.93** over 51 of 62 rows.  The replacement rule
reads no clock at all, so no date can move a resolved figure.

**The read was not the whole exposure, which is why the direction of the fix
matters.**  Two writers would have made those figures permanent: a settle ran
a cache reconciler in ``transaction_service`` BEFORE the status flip and
wrote the live figure into ``estimated_amount``, after which the row left the
read-time repair's Projected-only candidate set and nothing could repair it;
and any salary, calibration or tax-config save runs
``salary_regeneration.regenerate_salary_transactions`` (in the salary routes
package until plan step salary:S3-f-3), which rebuilds every
row from today forward.  A read-time defect with two write-back doors is a
storage defect on a delay.

*Both write-back doors are gone as of plan step **balance:X-au-d**: a salary
row DECLARES the definition that prices it and stores no figure, so the settle
has no cache to reconcile and a regeneration writes no amount.  The paragraph
stays because it is the ARGUMENT for the direction of this module's fix, not a
description of live code.*

    An earlier draft of this module resolved ONE year for the profile from the
    UNION of the three kinds and then loaded all three under it.  That is wrong
    in a way that moves money, because the loader needs each kind to have its
    own entry for that year: a year present in only one kind became the
    resolved year for itself AND for every later year, and the other two lines
    silently became zero across the whole horizon.  Measured on a clone of
    production 2026-08-11, when the law was stored per user and the Settings
    page could write a single kind for any year: saving one 2027 state-tax row
    made 2028 resolve to 2027, dropping the bracket set and FICA to ``None``
    and Social Security to ``$0.00`` -- **+$216.63 a period**.

    The law now carries federal rules and FICA for every year it carries
    (:class:`app.tax_law.TaxYearLaw` refuses a year without them), so that
    state can no longer arise between those two kinds.  A STATE still can: the
    law lists a state only for the years the app supports it, so a state added
    in a later year has no entry for the years before it.  Resolving each kind
    against its own series keeps that case correct rather than relying on it
    never happening.

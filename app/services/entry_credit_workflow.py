"""
Shekel Budget App -- Entry-Level Credit Card Workflow Service

Manages aggregated CC Payback transactions generated from individual
credit entries on entry-capable transactions.  When entries are flagged
as credit card purchases, this service creates, updates, or deletes
a single CC Payback expense in the next pay period whose amount equals
the sum of all credit entries.

This is the per-entry counterpart to credit_workflow.py, which handles
the legacy per-transaction Credit status.  Both services create CC
Payback transactions with identical field structures; the difference is
the amount source (entry sum vs. transaction amount) and the trigger
(entry mutation vs. status change).

    """Refuse an envelope whose card REFUNDS exceed its card purchases.

    Finding **N-411**, opened by ruling **bank_import:R-II**.  A CC Payback is
    an EXPENSE row recording what the owner owes the card, and
    ``ck_transactions_estimated_amount`` (``estimated_amount >= 0``) says so in
    the schema -- so a negative total has nowhere to go.  It is refused HERE,
    before any branch acts on it, rather than left to the arm below: that arm
    reads a non-positive total as "nothing is owed" and DELETES the payback,
    which for a negative total destroys a liability the row's card charges
    still carry.

    **Refusing rather than substituting**, which is the choice this service
    already makes for a settled payback two arms down: the app cannot represent
    a card that owes the OWNER, and inventing a representation for it -- a zero
    payback, a deleted one, an income row -- would each be filing money
    somewhere the model does not mean.  The owner is told what state they have
    described and what to do instead.

    **The credit-card arc may make this representable and this refusal
    removable** (a card with statements of its own is an account, and a credit
    balance on it is an ordinary fact).  Until then a non-representable state is
    refused where it is created, not stored in a shape that reads as something
    else.

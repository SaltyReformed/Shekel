"""Shared definitions for the rule that a deleted row holds no money.

**A payment or purchase is never under a deleted row** (plan step
``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``).  Deleting a row takes its movements off the books
(ruling **R-CC75**) and an archive hides only rows holding nothing
(**R-CC63**), so a hidden row holds no money -- unless a door writes some under
it afterwards, or hides it while it still holds some.  The first happened,
measured by the step's third review: a recurring $120.00 Hotel marked Paid and
then deleted still answered a stale second tab's popover, and saving an Actual
of $125.00 wrote a dated $125.00 payment record under the hidden row.  Its pay
period then locked ("holds a recorded payment or purchase") and Reset was
refused for good, with no screen able to reach the row.

**The rule has two directions, so it takes two attachments**, the lesson
:mod:`app.level_infrastructure` and :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` record:
the FACT lives on ``budget.transaction_entries`` (which row a movement is
under) and the STATE on ``budget.transactions`` (whether that row is deleted),
so either can move without the other.

* **A movement may not ARRIVE under a deleted row** (ruling **R-CC89**,
  developer 2026-09-23: *"The database refuses any payment or purchase written
  under a deleted row, so no door, now or later, can do it."*).  It arrives by
  ``INSERT``, or by an ``UPDATE`` that points it at another row.  An
  ``UPDATE`` that leaves ``transaction_id`` where it was is not an arrival, so
  it passes, and so do the ``SET NULL`` updates other tables' keys make to a
  movement's other columns.  Every deleted row counts, a transfer's leg
  included.
* **A row may not be HIDDEN while it holds one** (ruling **R-CC92**, which
  extends R-CC89, developer 2026-09-23, "Refuse both ways": *"The database
  also refuses hiding a row that still holds a payment or purchase, except a
  transfer's half (BAL-532's, until X-bi-6-4). The check runs when the change
  is saved, so a door that takes the money off and hides the row in the same
  save still works."*).  **A transfer's leg is excepted, and the exception is
  a FENCE with an owner**: the transfer's soft delete still hides a leg
  holding its kept payment -- finding **balance:BAL-532**, owned by plan step
  ``balance:X-bi-6-4`` -- and refusing it would turn that door into an error
  until then.  **Deleting the ``transfer_id IS NULL`` clause alone would not
  retire the fence**, because plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-2`` re-parents a
  transfer's movements onto ``budget.transfers`` (ruling **R-BAL88**: two
  side links, ``transaction_id`` NULL under an exactly-one-parent check):
  after it the legs hold nothing, a movement arriving under a deleted
  TRANSFER names no row the row arm reads, and a transfer's soft delete hides
  a ``budget.transfers`` row the row arm does not watch -- so R-CC92's "until
  X-bi-6-4" would become permanent without anyone deciding it.  What the
  re-parent owes the rule is :data:`TRANSFER_ARM`, three changes together:
  the arrival arm also refuses a movement whose TRANSFER parent is deleted,
  reading that parent's ``is_deleted`` under the same :data:`ROW_WRITE_LOCK`
  on ``budget.transfers`` (a read without it reopens, for transfers, the race
  ruling R-CC96 closed below); the hiding arm gains an attachment on
  ``budget.transfers``, excepting nothing; and the ``transfer_id IS NULL``
  clause goes from the row arm's ``WHEN`` and its function.  **The third
  lands with the transfer delete that takes a side's records off first**
  (design D7, finding BAL-532), at the leaf's second checkpoint: until then a
  transfer's records are still written under its legs and its soft delete
  still hides a leg holding one.  ``transfer_id`` is watched as well as
  ``is_deleted``, so a raw ``UPDATE`` re-pointing a hidden leg away from its
  transfer cannot walk out of the exception.

**This module is the rule's database half.**  The arrival arm's words are the
two writers' own refusals -- :func:`app.services.entry_service.create_entry`
for a purchase and
:func:`app.services.status_seam._refusals.reject_settlement_on_a_deleted_row`
for a payment record -- and the pages' half is the two ownership doors
answering "not found" for a deleted row (``get_accessible_transaction`` and
``routes/transactions/_helpers._get_owned_transaction``).  The hiding arm has
no words of its own because no door reaches it in either order of a race: the
row delete takes the movements off first and the archive leaves a holding row
alone, and each reads what the row holds after its request's owner lock (plan
step ``balance:X-bn``), so no other click of the owner's can add a movement
between that read and the hide.  Both arms are what make the rule hold for a bulk statement, a psql
session and a writer nobody enumerated, the same pairing
``ck_transaction_entries_positive_amount`` has with ``entry_service``'s refusal
of a purchase worth nothing.

**The rule holds under concurrency because the arrival arm LOCKS the row**
(ruling **R-CC96**, developer 2026-09-23, "Lock in both": *"the database
check locks the row, so no deleted row can hold money from any writer, listed
or not"*).  Under ``READ COMMITTED`` each arm reads committed data only, and a
row's soft delete takes ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` while a movement ``INSERT``'s
foreign-key check takes ``FOR KEY SHARE`` -- two locks that do not conflict.
So an arm without a lock of its own read the row as live while its delete was
open, the delete's deferred check found no movement because the purchase had
not committed, and both committed: the step's fourth review measured a $12.34
purchase added by one session while another deleted its Groceries row, ending
``(hidden, held) = (True, 1)``, the state this module exists to forbid.  The
arm now reads ``is_deleted`` under :data:`ROW_WRITE_LOCK`, so the two
serialise in either order: a hide already open makes the arrival wait, and
refuses it once the hide commits; an arrival already open makes the hide wait
until the movement has committed, when the hiding arm sees it and refuses the
hide.

**Why ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` and not the weaker ``FOR SHARE``.**  Either
conflicts with a hide; the difference is what the same transaction does NEXT.
A writer that inserts a movement and then writes the row -- a record's
insert followed by its status ``UPDATE``, or a purchase followed by the
payback sync's lock -- would have to upgrade a ``FOR SHARE`` this arm took,
and two such writers each holding it then wait on each other.  Measured
2026-09-23 on two raw connections, ``FOR SHARE`` then ``FOR NO KEY UPDATE`` on
one row: ``DeadlockDetected`` for one of the two, where taking ``FOR NO KEY
UPDATE`` first let both commit.  The app's own doors never reach that shape:
each runs after its request's owner write lock (plan step ``balance:X-bn``,
ruling **R-CC106**), so two of one owner's clicks never hold the row at once,
and the second click of a race meets a door's sentence instead of this arm's
raw error.  Until that step each door took this same row lock itself, BEFORE
its insert (rulings R-CC96 and R-CC100).  So the strength is graded by the raw
measurement alone: with ``FOR SHARE`` here the app's race module still passed
(the step's fifth review, measured while the doors took the row lock).  It is
the RAW writer's guarantee.

**The arrival arm is an immediate ``BEFORE`` row trigger**, as
:mod:`app.level_infrastructure` chose and for a sharper reason here.  A
trigger's ``WHEN`` can read only the movement's own columns, never its row's
``is_deleted``, so a deferred trigger would queue an event on EVERY movement
written, and a queued event makes DDL on ``budget.transaction_entries`` illegal
until the queue is drained -- the hazard
:mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` records costing two CI failures.  Immediate is
also correct for the one ordering that matters: SQLAlchemy's unit of work
writes a row before its children, so an un-delete and a write in one flush
pass, and a delete and a write in one flush are refused.

**The hiding arm is a DEFERRED constraint trigger, checked at COMMIT**, because
the ruling says so -- *"The check runs when the change is saved, so a door
that takes the money off and hides the row in the same save still works."* --
and because the ORDER of the two writes inside a save is not the rule's to
grade.  ``transaction_service.delete_transaction`` stages the movements'
``DELETE`` through the one removal act and then the row's ``is_deleted``;
**measured 2026-09-23 with this arm made immediate, that door still passed**,
because a read between the two (``credit_workflow``'s payback lookup)
autoflushes the ``DELETE`` first -- while the same two statements written row
first were refused.  An immediate check would make a correct door depend on an
incidental autoflush.  Its ``WHEN`` reads the row's own columns, so an
event is queued only when a non-transfer row is hidden, never on an ordinary
write -- but **a transaction that hides such a row and then runs DDL on
``budget.transactions`` must drain first** (``SET CONSTRAINTS ALL
IMMEDIATE``), the pattern :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` describes.  The
transfer arm's hiding attachment is the same kind of trigger with a wider
``WHEN`` (``NEW.is_deleted``: a transfer has no exempt kind), so it queues an
event on EVERY transfer soft delete, and a transaction that hides a transfer
and then runs DDL on ``budget.transfers`` must drain first too.

**The rule is built ARM BY ARM, and a revision declares its own**, the
construction :mod:`app.opening_infrastructure` adopted after measuring the
alternative: a migration imports this module LIVE, so without a declared arm
set ``c4a4e7d1b9f2`` (CC-5-4a-4's) would install, on a chain replay, an arm
naming link columns a later revision adds -- and the test template, which
replays the chain, would fail to build.  So each revision passes a LITERAL
tuple -- ``c4a4e7d1b9f2`` passes ``(ROW_ARM,)`` and the re-parent's revision
(X-bi-6-4d-2's) both arms -- and the two scripts that build a database at
head, ``scripts/init_database.py`` (fresh database, no migration chain) and
``scripts/build_test_template.py`` (re-applied idempotently so the latest
in-code definition wins), pass :data:`ALL_ARMS`.  A from-scratch database and
a migrated one therefore agree only while the NEWEST revision's tuple equals
:data:`ALL_ARMS`, which ``tests/test_models/test_deleted_row_arms.py`` asserts.
The statement is TOTAL: an arm the caller does not name is dropped, so a
downgrade that withdraws an arm is the same call naming one fewer.
``scripts/build_test_db_image.py`` counts :data:`DELETED_ROW_TRIGGERS` on the
baked image so a template missing an attachment is rebuilt rather than
trusted.

**Caller contract: every table an arm names must already exist**
(``budget.transactions`` and ``budget.transaction_entries``; with
:data:`TRANSFER_ARM`, ``budget.transfers`` and the entries' two side links).
``CREATE TRIGGER`` needs its table and columns, and each function body names
the other tables.

"""Presentation-only Jinja template filters.

Registered on the application in :func:`app.create_app` via
:func:`register_template_filters`.  Extracted from the factory
(``app/__init__.py``) so that module stays under its statement / line
ceiling and so display helpers have a home that is not the
already-large factory.

Every filter here transforms a value the route or service already
computed -- most for DISPLAY, and :func:`reviewed_token` for the WIRE.
None performs financial arithmetic: monetary math lives in the services
per the project's "templates display, never compute" rule (CLAUDE.md).
The two arithmetic helpers below (``to_percent``, ``months_to_years``)
operate on rates and term lengths, not money, and exist precisely so
templates do not inline that math.

**A wire transform belongs here for the same reason a display one does**,
and :func:`reviewed_token` is the first: the value it emits is READ BACK
by :class:`~app.schemas.validation.statements.ReviewedRowField`, so the
format has to be stated once and reached from both sides.  A template
composing those fields itself would be the second spelling, and nothing
in the tree fails when a template and a validator drift apart.

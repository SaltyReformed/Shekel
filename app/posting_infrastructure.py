"""Shared definitions for the balanced-journal constraint trigger.

The double-entry posting ledger (Build-Order Step 2,
:mod:`app.models.journal_entry`) requires a per-journal-entry invariant that
PostgreSQL cannot express as a row-level CHECK: every entry's posting legs
must ``SUM(amount) = 0`` and there must be ``COUNT(*) >= 2`` of them.  Both
are cross-row facts about an entry, so they live in a **deferred constraint
trigger** that validates at COMMIT -- after all of an entry's legs are
inserted -- rather than after the first leg.

Three callers must produce identical trigger infrastructure, exactly as
:mod:`app.audit_infrastructure` keeps the audit trigger in lock-step across
its three callers:

1. The Alembic migration that creates ``budget.account_postings`` (Commit 3
   of the posting-ledger plan) -- ``apply_posting_infrastructure(op.execute)``
   after the table is created.
2. ``scripts/init_database.py``, which initialises a fresh database via
   ``db.create_all()`` + an Alembic ``stamp`` -- a path that bypasses the
   migration chain.  ``create_all`` materialises the ``account_postings``
   table (a SQLAlchemy model) but NOT the trigger or its function, which are
   raw SQL outside the model registry, so this caller must apply them
   explicitly (the same gap ``audit_infrastructure`` fills for the audit
   trigger).
3. ``scripts/build_test_template.py``, which builds the
   ``shekel_test_template`` database the test suite clones per worker.  It
   runs the migration chain (which already applies this infrastructure) and
   then RE-applies it idempotently so the latest in-code trigger definition
   wins over any migration-frozen state -- mirroring its idempotent
   re-application of ``apply_audit_infrastructure``.

Centralising the SQL here is the only way to keep those three call sites
from drifting.

**Caller contract: the table must already exist.**  Unlike
:func:`app.audit_infrastructure.apply_audit_infrastructure`, this function is
NOT guarded against a missing target table, and deliberately so: the trigger
function's body references ``budget.account_postings``, and PostgreSQL's
default ``check_function_bodies = on`` validates that reference at
``CREATE FUNCTION`` time, so applying this infrastructure before the table
exists fails loudly (the right signal).  All three callers above apply it
only after the table is materialised.  There is no early "rebuild" migration
that runs it against a not-yet-created table (the case that forces the audit
module's ``pg_class`` existence guard), so no guard is needed here.

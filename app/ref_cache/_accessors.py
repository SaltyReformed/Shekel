"""One function per "what id is this enum member", and nothing else.

Split out of the flat ``app/ref_cache.py`` at plan step
**bank_import:X-f6e-1** (see :mod:`._state` for why).  **The move is pure**:
every function below stands exactly as it stood, comments and pragmas
included.  The one addition is that step's own
:func:`statement_balance_evidence_id`, the twenty-sixth of them.
:mod:`app.ref_cache` re-exports all of them, so no caller changed.

**Every one of them returns an ID and never a ``name``**, which is the
project-wide invariant these exist to serve: reference tables drive logic by
their integer key, and their strings are for display.  The custom checker
``shekel-refname-compare`` is the gate; this module is the door it points at.

**The cache is read through :func:`._state.cache` rather than bound by value**,
which is the one thing the split had to be careful about and is argued where
that function is defined.  It is the single mechanical difference between these
bodies and the ones the flat module carried: ``_cache.X`` became ``cache().X``
and ``_require_init()`` became ``require_init()``, uniformly, thirty-one times.

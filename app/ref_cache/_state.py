"""The cache ITSELF: what is loaded, when, and the guard every reader passes.

Split out of the flat ``app/ref_cache.py`` at plan step
**bank_import:X-f6e-1**, when a twenty-sixth reference table took the module
past pylint's 1,000-line ceiling (996 lines before it, 1,013 after).

**The MOVE is pure and the step's own addition rides with it**: every name
below stands exactly as it stood in the flat module, and the one thing that is
new is ``StatementBalanceEvidenceEnum``'s spec -- the table whose arrival forced
the split.  :mod:`app.ref_cache` re-exports every name this package DEFINES, so
the 98 modules that ``from app import ref_cache`` are untouched.  What it no
longer re-exports is the flat module's incidental import leakage: 26 enum
classes and 6 stdlib bindings that were module-level names only because they
were imported.  Measured before the split: 0 references to any of them through
the ``ref_cache`` namespace, anywhere in the repository.

The seam is the one the module already had: this half decides WHAT is cached
and refuses a reader who asks before it is, and :mod:`._accessors` is the
answer to "what id is this enum member".  The arrow runs one way -- the
accessors import this and it imports none of them.

    ``enum_ids`` maps each reference enum class to its ``{member: database

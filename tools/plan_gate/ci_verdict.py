"""Decide the ``lint-and-test`` check: green only when every grader that had to run passed.

Branch protection on ``main`` requires a status named ``lint-and-test``.  Until
plan step ``bank_import:X-gy`` that was one job running everything in series;
it is now several jobs in parallel -- the change-set classifier, the plan gate,
lint and the test shards -- and ``lint-and-test`` is the job that NEEDS all of
them and answers for them.  ``ci.yml`` hands it the ``needs`` context as JSON
on stdin and this module prints the verdict and exits non-zero on red.

**Why it cannot simply be a job that depends on the others.**  GitHub skips a
job whose dependency failed, and a SKIPPED required check counts as PASSING.
A ``lint-and-test`` that merely listed the graders in ``needs`` would therefore
be skipped -- green -- exactly when a shard failed: a gate that measures
nothing on the one day it matters.  So the job runs ``if: always()`` and every
result is judged here, in the direction that fails closed:

* A job in :data:`EVERY_SCOPE` must have succeeded, in every scope.
* A job in :data:`FULL_SCOPE_ONLY` must have succeeded -- unless the scope is
  exactly ``registry-only`` (``ci_scope``'s answer for a change set only the
  plan gate grades), when it may have been skipped.  A missing, empty or
  misspelt scope is NOT ``registry-only``, so it demands success.
* ``failure`` and ``cancelled`` are red in every scope.  A combined matrix
  result is ``failure`` when any leg failed (measured on the runner
  2026-09-22, run cited in ``test_ci_verdict.py``).
* A job this module does not name, or a named job absent from ``needs``, is
  red: a verdict that does not know what it is grading has not graded it.

Usage from ``ci.yml``::

    printf '%s' "${NEEDS}" | python tools/plan_gate/ci_verdict.py

with ``NEEDS: ${{ toJSON(needs) }}``.

"""The ARCHIVE arm: a historical document declares itself one, on its first line.

**This module exists because a session read an archived implementation plan as
the plan of record.**  The document had been superseded months earlier and said
nothing about it, so nothing in the act of opening it was a warning, and the
work that followed was planned against a document the developer had deliberately
retired.

**Keeping live documents from CITING an archived path does not fix that**, which
is why the predicate is not written that way.  A grep, a glob or a
half-remembered filename reaches an archived file without any live document's
help, and the archive is precisely where a filename that once meant something
still resolves -- so a rule policing live citations would have been GREEN
throughout the incident it was meant to prevent.  The banner goes on the
ARTIFACT instead, at the first line, where a reader arriving from anywhere
cannot get around it.

Separate from ``_registry.py`` because it grades neither registry: its subject
is every markdown file under an archived directory, and its only input from the
registry is the repository root.

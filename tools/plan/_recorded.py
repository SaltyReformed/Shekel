"""Recorded GitHub exchanges: kept by a session that calls GitHub once, replayed by the tests.

The plan tool's tests never call GitHub (the build plan, L2), yet a test fed a
response its author imagined grades the author's imagination.  So the
exchanges the tests replay were RECORDED: :class:`Recorder` wraps the session
a real :class:`_github.GitHub` sends through and keeps every request and
GitHub's answer, and :class:`Replay` answers the same requests with the same
answers, in the order they were recorded, refusing any request it never saw.

A recording is JSON: ``{"scratch": {...}, "exchanges": [{"method", "url",
"body", "status", "answer"}, ...]}``.  Nothing secret is in one: the token
rides in a header, and headers are not kept.

**A recording session writes to scratch cards only, and keeps the text of
scratch cards only.**  A recording lives in the PUBLIC code repository, and the
tracker it reads is private: real production figures are allowed there
(``R-BAL172``).  So:

- **The scratch cards are fixed before anything is sent** (:class:`Scratch`):
  the cards the recording session has checked carry a scratch title
  (:data:`SCRATCH`), and the plan board's id.  The set grows only by what the
  session itself makes: a card it files with a scratch title, and the board
  item it adds for a scratch card.
- **Only a known write to a scratch card is sent** (:func:`refusal`, asked of
  every request before it goes out, and of every request a recording keeps): a
  REST write takes one of the routes in :data:`_ROUTES` on the tracker, with
  exactly the body keys the plan tool sends (their values are not checked but
  for the cards they name) and every card it names -- in its path, by its REST
  id, or as a claim -- a scratch card; a GraphQL write is one of the
  board's four, word for word, on the plan board, moving a scratch card's
  board item.  A body sent other than as JSON is refused too.  Anything else is
  refused, unsent.
- **Every string an answer holds is redacted** (:data:`REDACTED`) unless its
  key is one of :data:`_KEPT` -- ids, states, names of labels, types and
  repositories, dates, error messages -- or it belongs to a scratch card, or it
  is the plan board's own title (:data:`setup_tracker.PROJECT_TITLE`, already
  in this repository).  An object carrying a ``number`` is that card of the
  tracker only when it names the tracker as its repository, or names none and
  sits where the request reads the tracker's own cards: the answer itself to a
  REST request under the tracker, or a field of the tracker's ``repository``
  (and its ``issues``) in a GraphQL query whose every ``repository(...)`` is
  the tracker's and that aliases nothing as ``repository``.  Any other
  numbered object is no card.  An object with no number that carries a
  string of its own belongs to NO card -- except the answer itself, which is
  the card the request's URL names, and the edit history of an object that
  carries a card's number; any other object shares its enclosing object's
  card.

What a recording can still hold: a string under a :data:`_KEPT` key, of any
card (so a key enters that set only when no card's text can be stored under
it); everything on the REQUEST side, kept as sent because the replay matches it
-- read URLs, search terms, GraphQL variables, a claim commit's message -- so a
recording session puts no private text in a request; a scratch card's own
text, including any edit history from before it carried a scratch title (the
recording sessions file their scratch cards as scratch); and, where the request
reads the tracker's own cards, the text of an object carrying a number that is
not a card's (a milestone numbered like a scratch card), read as that card's.

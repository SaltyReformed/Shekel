"""An in-memory tracker for the ``plan`` command's tests, and the helpers they share.

``_tracker`` is graded against RECORDED GitHub answers (``test__tracker.py``);
the command's tests grade what each command decides to read and write, so they
drive the commands against :class:`FakeTracker`, which keeps cards in memory.
It keeps what the commands depend on the way the recordings show GitHub keeping
it -- a body edit saves a full version, and the first edit also saves the body
as filed; a parent's read lists each sub-issue's kind and state as they stand
now, not as they were when it was linked; a mark removed from a card that
does not carry it is answered as GitHub answers it, 404; a card added to the board
again keeps the item it has (and, unmeasured, its place), and an unlink of a card
that is no sub-issue of the parent named is refused 403, as GitHub answers both
(``recorded/twice.json``, ``recorded/unlink.json``) -- and FAILS LOUDLY on a write
the tool must never send
(re-parenting a card, under a parent inside the tracker or out), rather than
guessing GitHub's answer to it.  Its board shows a
placement at once unless told to lag (:attr:`FakeBoard.lagging`); the lag
itself is graded against a recording.
Nothing here calls GitHub.

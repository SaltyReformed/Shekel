"""The rows (step X-cx's K1b-1): every stored row of the dump, once base's deploy step and
once cut's has run on it, compared row by row, the noise gate and the planted controls run
every time (``design.md`` s.3 items 2, 3, 5, 8 and 10).

THE DEPLOY IS PRODUCTION'S.  Each state's clone runs that state's ``scripts/init_database.py``
from its worktree and under its venv, as entrypoint step 3 runs it, in an environment BUILT
WHOLE (:func:`side_environment`): nothing of the shell that runs the kit reaches it, so an
operator's ``DATABASE_URL_APP``, ``RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI`` or ``SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY`` cannot.
What production's image and compose file give the app is read from the side's own tree, so a
cut that changes it is measured with it.  The step runs through the side probe's
``side/deploy.py``, under ONE instant every side's clock is pinned at: noon of the dump's civil
day in base's zone, computed once a run (:func:`pinned_instant`), so a run that crosses
midnight deploys every side on one day.

EVERY TABLE IN THE CATALOG, every row, every column.  A table with a primary key is compared
row by row by that key; one without, or one whose key is not the same on both sides, as a
multiset of its rows, and the report names it.  ``system.audit_log`` is a multiset of what each
event wrote and when: never its id or database user, since its ids come from a sequence every
deploy advances.  Each row is hashed in SQL; only a row that differs is fetched whole.

THE STAMPS ARE COMPARED, BUT FOR THE ONES A DEPLOY WROTE (``balance:R-BAL331``).  A stamp is a
timestamp whose default is a read of the server's clock and nothing else, as both sides'
catalogs say (:func:`stamps`); PostgreSQL's clock writes it, which no pin reaches, so two
deploys run at two moments write two values.  The cluster's clock is read once just before the
first deploy: THE LINE (:func:`read_line`).  A stamp later than the line reads as ``deploy``
(:class:`Reading`); every other stamp is compared exactly, the audit log's own clock and the
stamps in the rows its events wrote included.  The line is checked every run: a stamp of the
restored dump later than it stops the run, named.

THE NOISE GATE: base is deployed on two clones, and both must read identical.  A difference
there is the kit's failure, never the release's (exit 2).  It catches a clock column the stamp
list does not name only where base's deploy writes one; on a dump at base's own revision that
deploy writes nothing, and a clock column only cut's deploy writes is a difference (exit 1),
never an exit 0.

THE PLANTED CONTROLS, every run, each on a clone of base's deployed copy, nothing else
touched (triggers and foreign-key checks are off for the plant): a cent added to a numeric
column, a byte changed in a text column, a row removed, and a stamp moved to a moment earlier
than both itself and the line.  The comparison must find each exactly.  Then the fifth: the
clock written into the same stamp on two clones in turn, which the comparison of the two must
NOT find, and which the noise gate cannot grade (on a dump at base's own revision its deploy
writes nothing).  Any control that fails means the run measured nothing (exit 2).

THE ROLLBACK runs exactly when production's would once cut's deploy has stored its copy: when
base's tree carries a migration script for every revision that copy is stamped at
(:func:`base_resolves`, which mirrors ``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh``'s ``image_resolves_revisions``).
Then, in entrypoint order, base's deploy step runs again on a clone of cut's deployed copy and
must exit 0 and move no row, and base's app must boot there (``side/boot.py``).  When base's
tree does not know the revision, that script would refuse the rollback and name the dump to
restore, and the run says so: the copy's migration version is already a row that differs.  When
cut's deploy refused, its one transaction left the dump as it was, so production's rollback is
base's own deploy on it, which the run has already measured (the boot aside), and none runs.

What it does NOT compare is printed on every run (:data:`NOT_COMPARED`), the audit log's
dropped columns and the stamps' one hole among it, and with it the limit the days put on a run
(:func:`day_limit`), so an exit 0 is never read as a claim about them.

Usage, which brings a bench up (:mod:`.bench`), deploys, compares and tears it down::

    python -m tools.rehearsal.rows --dump <pg_dump -Fc file> --base <revision> \\
        --cut <revision> --report <file>

Exit status: 0 no row differs and the rollback holds; 1 rows differ (each one in the report,
summed per table and column on stdout), cut's deploy refused the copy base's deployed, or the
rollback to base on cut's deployed copy fails (named); 2 nothing was measured:
the bench, base's deploy, the noise gate, a control, or the run itself (a file it could not
write, a database error) failed, each named.  A failure of the run is never exit 1, which
says rows differ.

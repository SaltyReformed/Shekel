"""The rehearsal's bench (step X-cx's K1a-2): one private cluster holding a dump restored once
and cloned per state, and a detached worktree of this repository per state, all torn down on
the way out by a census that names anything left.

What it is built from, each its one home's:

* The image is ``scripts/build_test_db_image.py``'s, built or verified on every run as
  ``test.sh`` does, and the cluster's whole life -- the token, the start, the stop and the URL
  a caller connects by -- is ``scripts/private_cluster.py``'s.  Both run as subprocesses: the
  orchestrator imports nothing from ``scripts`` (the package docstring says why).
* Git runs through :mod:`tools.ci.gitcmd`, which strips the variables that bind git to
  another repository (a hook run from a linked worktree sets them), and every worktree is
  ``git worktree add --detach``, never a checkout.
* The dump is read and restored by the IMAGE's ``pg_restore``, run inside the cluster's
  container by ``private_cluster.py client`` with the dump on its standard input
  (:func:`in_cluster`), so neither this host nor CI needs PostgreSQL's tools, and the tools
  are always the cluster's major (``balance:R-BAL327``).

THE CLUSTER IS OWNED BY A TOKEN made before anything starts, and the stop by it is handed to
the teardown before the start runs, so a failure or a Ctrl-C at any later point stops what the
start made.  One window outlives that stop, the cluster module's own: a start KILLed while its
``docker run`` is in flight leaves its socket directory, empty.

THE DAEMON IS THE CLUSTER MODULE'S.  ``private_cluster.py`` chooses it (``DOCKER_HOST``, else
the rootless socket in ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR``) and refuses one that is not rootless unless CI or
``SHEKEL_ALLOW_HOST_DOCKER=1`` sanctions it, in the start itself (the coordinator's ruling on
K1a-2's review, B1: a bench that chose none put a cluster holding a production dump on the
SYSTEM daemon whenever ``DOCKER_HOST`` was unset).  The bench asks it first, before the image is
prepared, and hands its answer to the image builder (:func:`image_tag`), so a refused daemon
gets no image and the image is baked where the cluster runs.

A DUMP FROM ANOTHER POSTGRESQL MAJOR IS REFUSED before it is restored.  Every custom-format
archive records the server that made it (``Dumped from database version``), so production's
major is read from the dump on every run, never by reaching into production.

EACH SIDE RUNS UNDER A VENV OF ITS OWN PINS, never the developer's: THAT side's
``requirements.txt`` plus the ``time-machine`` pin of its ``requirements-dev.txt`` (the side
probe pins its clock with it), so a pin that moves between base and cut -- a Dependabot change
-- is measured rather than masked by one shared venv.  It is CACHED outside git, under
``${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/shekel-rehearsal/venvs/``, by the SHA-256 of those lines and the
interpreter's version, so two sides with the same pins share one and a later run builds
nothing; the cache is the one thing a teardown deliberately leaves.  A venv counts as built
only once its marker is written, the last step of a build that succeeded, so one that failed
or was killed is never taken for built: the next run removes it and builds again.  It is
built where it stays, never moved, because a venv's scripts hold its path in their shebangs.
Two runs building the same venv at the same moment would collide in its directory; one kit
runs at a time.

Usage, which brings a bench up and tears it down, printing what each part took::

    python -m tools.rehearsal.bench --dump <pg_dump -Fc file> --state <name>=<revision> ...

Exit status: 0 the bench came up and left nothing; 2 it could not, or it left something, each
thing named.

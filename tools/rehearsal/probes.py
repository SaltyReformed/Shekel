"""Running a side probe (step X-cx's K1b; a module of its own since K1c-2): a script of
``side/``, run by path under a side's venv from its worktree, in an environment built whole,
its clock pinned at the run's one instant; the deploy step and the boot are two of them.

THE DEPLOY IS PRODUCTION'S.  Each state's clone runs that state's ``scripts/init_database.py``
from its worktree and under its venv, as entrypoint step 3 runs it, in an environment BUILT
WHOLE (:func:`side_environment`): nothing of the shell that runs the kit reaches it, so an
operator's ``DATABASE_URL_APP``, ``RATELIMIT_STORAGE_URI`` or ``SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY`` cannot.
What production's image and compose file give the app is read from the side's own tree, so a
cut that changes it is measured with it.  The step runs through the side probe's
``side/deploy.py``, under ONE instant every side's clock is pinned at: noon of the dump's civil
day in base's zone, computed once a run (:func:`pinned_instant`), so a run that crosses
midnight deploys every side on one day.

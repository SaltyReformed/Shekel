"""Persistent Playwright auth + screenshot helper for the Shekel dev app.

Why this exists
---------------
The dev app deliberately issues a *non-permanent* session cookie
(``app/config.py``: sessions are left non-permanent so Flask-Login's
``strong`` protection keeps working) and runs Flask-Login with
``session_protection = "strong"`` (``app/extensions.py``).  Together that means:

* the session cookie has no ``Max-Age`` -- it lives only as long as the browser
  context is open, so every fresh Playwright context starts logged out; and
* the session is wiped on any User-Agent / source-IP drift.

The result is that naive screenshot automation re-authenticates on every run.
This helper captures an authenticated Playwright ``storage_state`` **once** and
reuses it across runs, so screenshots do not trigger a re-login each time.  The
reuse window is bounded by ``IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`` (dev: 7 days), and every
reuse refreshes that window, so a session used at least weekly never expires.

The saved state contains a live dev auth cookie, so it is written to
``tools/playwright/.auth/`` which is git-ignored -- it must never be committed.

Credentials
-----------
MFA is disabled on the dev users, so login is email + password only.  The email
and password are resolved, in order, from:

1. ``SHEKEL_DEV_LOGIN_EMAIL`` / ``SHEKEL_DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD`` in the process env;
2. the same two keys in the repo-root ``.env``;
3. ``SEED_USER_EMAIL`` / ``SEED_USER_PASSWORD`` in the repo-root ``.env``.

If none resolve (or the password no longer matches the cloned dev user), fall
back to a one-time manual capture: ``capture --manual`` opens a real browser
window for you to log in by hand, then saves the state.

Usage
-----
    # One-time (or whenever the saved session goes stale):
    python tools/playwright/shekel_shot.py capture            # automated, headless
    python tools/playwright/shekel_shot.py capture --manual   # log in by hand

    # Take a screenshot (auto-refreshes a stale session when creds are present):
    python tools/playwright/shekel_shot.py shot /dashboard out.png
    python tools/playwright/shekel_shot.py shot /analytics out.png --full-page

    # Report whether a valid saved session exists:
    python tools/playwright/shekel_shot.py status

Run with the repo venv's Python so Playwright and its browsers resolve:
``.venv/bin/python tools/playwright/shekel_shot.py ...``.

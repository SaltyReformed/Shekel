"""Where every node of a source module goes under a plan, and what each output must import.

The layout is a pure function of the source and the plan.  It places each top-level node
exactly once: a test where the plan names it (or its slices, for a split class), every
fixture in ``conftest.py``, every helper no part names in ``_helpers.py``.  Then it resolves
each output's free names, read by :mod:`symtable`, against the source's own bindings: an
import alias is re-imported from the statement that bound it, a node placed in
``_helpers.py`` is imported from there, a builtin needs nothing.  Anything else is refused;
the tool never guesses where a name comes from.

**Refused here, beyond what the source reader and the class splitter refuse:** a test the
plan does not place, a fixture a part names, a name placed twice; a module-level fixture of
any scope but ``function`` (a package ``conftest.py`` would run it once per part); a
module-level ``pytest_*`` hook, ``pytestmark``, ``pytest_plugins`` or dunder (a conftest
widens a hook's reach, and a part would not carry the others); ``global``; a no-argument
``vars()``; ``request.getfixturevalue`` (its fixture's reach is unobserved on a branch the
record run did not take); ``inspect`` called on a moved node; a ``__module__`` read off a
moved node or off the running test (``self``, ``cls``, ``request``, ``type(...)``,
``super()``); a ``request`` attribute naming the requesting module or file, or a docstring
read through ``request`` when a class is split; a free name naming the module
itself (``__file__``, ``__name__``, ...: a part sits one directory deeper); a node in one
part reading a node placed in another; ``globals()`` unless every node reading each key it
writes lands in the same output; and an import alias nothing reads that the plan does not
place.

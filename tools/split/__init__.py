"""Split a test module that has outgrown the line budget into a package, as a PROVED pure move
(step ``balance:X-er``, ruling ``R-BAL301``: every Python file under 1,000 lines).

The model never carries the code: a plan names which top-level nodes go to which part, and
the tool moves source lines by their AST line ranges.  ``tests/<dir>/<module>.py`` becomes
``tests/<dir>/<module>/``: ``__init__.py`` (the module's docstring, verbatim),
``conftest.py`` (its module-level fixtures), ``_helpers.py`` (its helpers and constants, and
the mixin of any class split across parts) and ``test_<subject>.py`` parts.  Each part
imports only what it reads.  A plan the tool cannot prove is REFUSED; it never guesses.

**The proof a split commit quotes** (``split.py prove``): every moved node verbatim and
``ast.dump``-identical and held exactly once, in source order (:mod:`._prove`); the same
tests collected under a total, one-to-one old -> new node-id map; every test ending the
same way, skip / xfail / xpass included, with all parts run together AND each part run
alone; every pylint message in the parts answered by the source line it came from (an
import-sequence message by the source's import block), and every duplicate-code pair between
parts one the split revealed, never one it could have created; the plan gate green; and
every line still naming the old module, listed (:mod:`._dynamic`).

**Which pointers to the old path a split commit edits** (the coordinator's ruling on the
split session's forks, 2026-10-15).  The same commit that moves a file edits every LIVE
pointer to it.  A pointer is live when its document is live AND the line says where
something IS: a class or test to go and read.  Code comments, test docstrings, a live
registry row's path text and a live design audit's class pointer are edited.  A dated
record, a log and a stale plan keep the path they held on their date: rewritten, they
would name a path that did not exist then.  Nothing under ``archive/`` or ``historical/``,
and nothing that declares itself ``ARCHIVED`` on its first line, is ever edited.  The
census (:func:`._run.census`) lists every remaining line; the commit body names each one
not edited, with its reason (dated record, log, or stale plan), so a reader finds it in git.

**When a split class's slices OPEN alike, move the slice boundary.**  Every slice of a split
class begins with the same generated line, ``class <Name>(_<Name>Members):``.  When the
tests that open two slices begin with the same code, pylint's duplicate-code run extends up
onto that line in both parts, and the duplicate-code arm (:mod:`._similar`) refuses the pair as
CREATED, because it touches a generated line.  That refusal is correct and fails closed; the
remedy is a plan whose slices start at tests that differ, never a loosened arm.

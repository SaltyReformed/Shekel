"""A release's verdict: what refuses it, what the developer's approval question must name,
and, when it is refused or carries two migrations, the newest earlier cut to offer.

The rules are card ``plan#9``'s and the developer's (rulings ``balance:R-BAL279`` -
``R-BAL281``, ``R-BAL287`` and ``R-BAL288``):

- **Refused** (exit 1): two steps that move money, an undone one counting as one
  (R-BAL288); a deploy-together group the release leaves production holding in part
  (each leaf it lacks named; R-BAL288: wholly in production or wholly out); a carried
  step whose money flag cannot be read and is not declared (declared only before the
  cutover, R-BAL287); a claim the cut's reader cannot read; and each money mover
  (declared ones too) or added migration the skill names UNREHEARSED, because it found
  no rehearsal kit for it (R-BAL281's interim, as the developer confirmed it 2026-10-13:
  such a release is refused in R-BAL280's shape).  Whether a kit exists, and an
  unreadable step's flag, are the skill's judgment, so they are inputs.
- **Needs the approval question to name it** (exit 3): each money flag the skill
  DECLARED, with its source; two or more added migrations; and every migration already
  on ``main`` that the release edits or deletes.
- Otherwise clean (exit 0).

**The cut to offer** (R-BAL280): the candidates are the cuts ``dev`` actually stood at,
the first-parent line of ``<base>..<cut>``, newest first.  On a refusal, the newest that
is not refused; when the cut adds two or more migrations, separately the newest that is
not refused and adds at most one ("cut before the second").  Each candidate is judged
by the same rules, with the same unrehearsed names.

That line is the states ``dev`` stood at only when the cut is ``dev``'s tip, as the
skill pins it, or a cut this command offered: ``dev`` takes each pull request as a merge
commit (measured 2026-10-13: the 7 first-parent commits of ``dev`` from the 10-09-b
release to pull request #555 are all merges, one per pull request), so each candidate is
``dev`` after a whole pull request.  Cut at a feature branch's tip, the line is that
branch's own commits, and an offered cut can hold a leaf's code without its claim.

**Every candidate is judged with what the release's cut knows**, read once by the one
reader the cut's tree calls for: before the cutover
(:class:`~tools.release._carried.Knowledge`), each step's flag read over the CUT's
window (or declared) and the groups' leaves at the cut; after it
(:class:`~tools.release._cards.Cards`), the cards the cut's window names, read from the
tracker once.  Before the cutover, a candidate's own window is narrower and can miss a
version that marks a step, or a leaf filed later, so judged on its own it could pass
what the cut was refused for (the delta review of 2026-10-13 built four such
histories).  So a step the cut reads as a money mover is one at every
candidate, a name the skill gave as unrehearsed refuses every candidate carrying it, and
a candidate that adds a migration the cut does not add is refused, since the skill
judged no rehearsal of it.

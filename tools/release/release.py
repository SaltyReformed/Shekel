"""The ``/release`` skill's tested half: what a release carries, and what to clean up after it.

Not ``quill release``, which deletes a card's claim: this is a release of code to
production (card ``plan#9``).  Everything with a person or a judgment in it -- the
developer's two questions, the CI reads, the rehearsal, the deploy and its checks -- is
the skill's prose (``.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md``, X-cx's piece L9a-2); this
command reads git; the plan's registries as each commit holds them, or, for a cut after
the cutover, the tracker's cards through quill's App; and the dev database server's
listing; and writes nothing.

``plan`` judges the release ``<base>..<cut>`` (:mod:`tools.release._plan`): the steps it
carries, each step's money flag and deploy-together group, the migrations it adds, edits
or deletes; what refuses it; what the developer's approval question must name; and, on a
refusal or two added migrations, the newest earlier cut to offer him.  ``census`` lists
every worktree, every branch ``main`` already holds or a kit names, and every dev
database, marking what this release made: its ``release/<date>`` branch and what each
rehearsal kit's manifest names (:mod:`tools.release._census`).

Usage, from the repository root, after ``git fetch origin``::

    python -m tools.release.release plan --cut SHA [--base origin/main]
        [--unrehearsed KEY|REVISION ...] [--declare KEY=money|none@SOURCE ...]
    python -m tools.release.release census [--main origin/main] [--release-branch release/DATE]
        [--kit DIR ...]

``--unrehearsed`` names a money-moving step (``<arc>:<id>``, or ``plan#N`` after the
cutover) or an added migration's revision for which the skill found no rehearsal kit;
the release is refused for it.  ``--declare`` gives the flag of a carried step no
version of ``steps.md`` holds open (one written already ticked), with the commit or
handoff it was read from; the approval question must name each declaration, and a
declaration for any other step stops the command, as does every declaration on a cut
after the cutover, where each card's flag is its label (R-BAL287).  ``--kit`` names a
rehearsal kit's directory, which holds the kit's ``release-manifest.txt``: one line per
thing the kit made, written before it made it.

Exit status, ``plan``: 0 clean; 1 refused, each reason printed with the cut to offer;
3 the approval question must name what is printed; 2 nothing was judged (the command
line, git, the tracker, an unrehearsed name that names nothing, or a declaration that
fills no unreadable flag).  ``census``: 0 listed, every kit's manifest accepted; 4
listed, but a kit was refused (each reason printed), so the cleanup is NOT proven and
nothing that kit names is marked, whoever else names it; 2 git, the compose file or the
docker listing failed.
A judged run's last line on stdout is its ``verdict:``; exit 2 and a crash print none.

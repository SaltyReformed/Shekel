"""After a release: every worktree, every branch already in ``main`` or named by a rehearsal
kit, and every database on the dev server, each marked MADE when this release made it
(read-only).

The skill removes only what is marked MADE: the release's own ``release/<date>`` branch,
local and on ``origin``, and what each of its rehearsal kits names in its MANIFEST,
``<kit directory>/release-manifest.txt`` (:data:`MANIFEST`).  A kit writes one line per
thing it makes -- ``worktree <absolute path>``, ``branch <name>`` (a local branch) or
``database <name>`` (a clone on the dev server) -- and appends each line BEFORE it makes
the thing, so a kit that dies mid-run leaves a line naming something absent, never a
thing no line names.  An entry marks a thing MADE when it names it EXACTLY (a worktree's
path compared resolved) and the thing is present; an entry naming nothing present is
listed as GONE.  A branch a kit names is listed, and MADE, even when ``main`` does not
hold it.  Everything else is reported with the worktree it is checked out in, for its
owner: a peer lane's worktree is not this session's to remove.  ``main`` and ``dev`` are
never listed, so no release can be told to delete them.

A kit is REFUSED, and nothing it names is marked MADE or GONE on its word -- nor MADE on
any other kit's, or on ``--release-branch``'s -- when its manifest is absent, unreadable
or malformed (:func:`_entries`), or names what no kit makes
(:func:`_guards`): the repository's main worktree or the worktree this census runs in;
a worktree with a branch checked out that the manifest does not also name, or a branch
checked out in a worktree it does not also name; ``main`` or ``dev``; the dev database
or the server's own.  Each entry of a refused kit is still listed, present or absent,
for the person who finishes its cleanup by hand.  A census with a refused kit is NOT a
proven cleanup (:attr:`Census.proven`).  What it cannot tell: an entry naming EXACTLY a
thing the kit did not make -- a peer's clone or detached worktree of the same name, or a
peer's branch checked out nowhere, whose unpushed commits ``git branch -D`` would lose --
is marked MADE, so a kit's names must be its own (the skill tells kit authors how).

The dev database server's container, user and database are read from the dev compose
file, their one home; the database listing runs behind an injected runner, so a test
never calls docker.

"""Which cards a release carries after the cutover, whether each moves money, and which
deploy-together groups each is under: the release tool's card reader (step X-cx's
L9a-1b, T-a a1; rulings ``balance:R-BAL287`` - ``R-BAL289``), read from the ship markers
since step X-cx's M3 (ruling ``R-BAL359``).

**What a release carries is git's answer, read from the ship markers**: card N shipped
when its marker ``plan/ships/N`` is in the tree (``tools/quill/_git.py``).  A release of
``cut`` into ``base`` leaves production running the tree of their merge, as the release's
own merge into ``main`` writes it (:func:`tools.quill.door.merged_tree`: a marker that
conflicts in it refuses to judge), and it carries each card whose marker that tree adds
(shipped), changes (shipped again after an undo: every claim writes a new line) or deletes
(UNDONE), against ``base``'s: the NET change, so a card shipped and undone inside one
window was in production on neither side and is not carried, and one undone that
production held is carried and judged by the same rules as a ship, since it changes what
production runs as much (the report ruled as ``R-BAL359``, its s.10, refining
``R-BAL288``).  Against the merge and not the cut alone, so a hotfix on ``main`` the cut
lacks reads as no undo.  Production holds ``base``'s markers before the release and the
merge's after it, by quill's one reading of a tree (:func:`tools.quill.door.marked`); a
card's commits are those of ``<base>..<cut>`` that changed its marker, by quill's one walk
(:func:`tools.quill.door.marker_changes`): its claim and the merge that landed it.

**A card moves money when it carries the moves-money label**: its OWN label, as the
tracker holds it when the release is judged, split or not (the coordinator, under
R-BAL207, 2026-10-14).  A label is no sentence a tick rewrites, so a card keeps its flag
after it ships (the registries' ``recurrence:R20`` shape, which the pre-cutover reader
reads around, has no counterpart here).  A step split into leaves since its marker
landed is judged as the work it was, by its own label: a split writes the step only its
sub-issue link, so its labels stay (``tools/quill/test_quill_file.py``), and each leaf is
judged by its own when the window names it.  No card inherits a leaf's label: a label a
person moves by hand is an edit any card can take, split or not, and a step undone and
re-planned into a money leaf would count as a second money change beside that leaf,
refusing every release from then on (the full-leaf review of 2026-10-14, its E2).

**A group is a card labelled deploy-together**, and **after a release that touches a
group, production holds it wholly or not at all** (R-BAL288; the coordinator's C', under
R-BAL207, 2026-10-14; only a group the release touches gets a verdict on its members, so
a leaf filed under a group after it was released whole holds back only a release that
touches it; the read's two checks below run over every group it holds).  Its MEMBERS,
judged per cut (:func:`_member`), are the steps below it that production must
hold together: each leaf below it that can still ship, by quill's one leaf rule
(``leaves_below``: a leaf split again counting as its own leaves); each step below it
that production holds at the cut, whatever the plan now says of it, since its code is
in production and its siblings must not be there without it; and each step below
it that will never ship that production holds at the base, which the release keeps or
takes out.  A step that will never ship is dropped (quill's ``dropped``: a leaf closed as
dropped; a step re-planned into leaves that were all dropped; a split step a person
closed; a step left out of quill's leaves, closed while still being filed) or under a
step that was (``dropped_above``; R-BAL185: a person's close of a split step is a drop
its leaves inherit, never copied onto them).  So a step re-planned into leaves that can
still ship is a member only while production holds it at the cut (its leaves are members
throughout), and a finding is never one: a fix the group cannot ship without is a leaf.

"Below" is the group's links read DOWN, each step linked under it, under those, ...
(quill's closure, :func:`tools.quill.door.with_closure`, holds every one): the walk
quill's leaf rule reads, so a group's leaves are always among its steps.  Which groups a
release TOUCHES reads the same links UP (:func:`tools.quill.door.above`, quill's one
walk up the steps a card splits): each group a card it names is under, the card itself
or a step above it.  **Under every read this reader judges, the two walks give a group
the same steps, and no step hangs below it unread**: the read takes every card below
each group, of any kind, and judges nothing when a step hangs under a card that is no
step (:func:`_none_hung`: only a person's link or retype puts one there, since quill
links a step only under the step it splits), and then compares the two walks for each
group and judges nothing when they part (:func:`_one_walk`: only a link or a card's
type changed between the tracker's rounds of the read parts them), so no member is
dropped because a walk missed it (the coordinator, under R-BAL207, 2026-10-14).  **Both
checks run over every group the read holds, whether the release touches it or not**: a
group quill's closure holds for any other reason (for example one blocking a card the
closure reads, one above such a blocker, or one above a named card that touches
nothing) is read below too, and a step hung or a walk parted there refuses the release
(``release plan`` exits 2, nothing judged), naming the cards and the way to mend them,
although no verdict on members reads that group (the coordinator, under R-BAL207,
2026-10-14: kept strict, the PR #565 delta review's M-1).  A card the release names
under a group is a leaf, a step re-planned into leaves since its
marker landed (quill splits no step git says shipped, so it was undone first, or
split before its ship merged; a person can split one on the web), a step that will never
ship, a finding, or the group's own card (the coordinator, under R-BAL207, 2026-10-14).
A card the release names that will never ship touches nothing unless production holds
it, at the base or at the cut.  A release touching a group must leave production holding
every member or none: a release taking a whole group out is whole too.

**A step closed while still being filed is no member once quill's ``sync`` runs**:
``sync`` unlinks it (R-BAL205: it was never part of the split), so it is below no group,
and a release keeping its siblings without it would pass.  No card production holds
carries that mark by any tool's write: quill marks a card only when it creates it, and
CI's landing check refuses a marker a claim writes for a card that still carries the mark
("still being filed: finish it with quill file, then land"; ``tools/quill/landing.py``,
its rule 7), and neither ``dev`` nor ``main`` held a marker before that check existed
(measured 2026-10-23).  So this reader reads the links as the tracker holds them, and no
history of them.

**No refusal of a group is permanent.**  A refusal names each member the release lacks
(missing, or taken out by it) and, when a member will never ship, every member it would
keep; the report's line for the group names every member, carried, released, missing
and undone.  Two ways out stand:

- **Take the group out**: the same release deletes the marker of each member it would
  keep (the report's carried and released).  That leaves production holding none of the
  group, in ONE round by construction: every step below the group that production holds
  at a cut is a member, so with those markers deleted production holds no step below it
  at the new cut.  quill's ``dropped`` and ``leaves`` read git's shipped set, so a deleted
  marker can turn a live step dead or a container back into a leaf; the new cut is judged
  with its own read, and no such change makes production hold a step below the group.
  Where groups nest, the outer group's way out takes the inner one out too.  CI's landing
  check passes a marker's delete from any branch (``tools/quill/landing.py``, its rule 2),
  so a step production holds, a split one included, may be undone and this way out lands.
- **Ship it whole**: a member named as missing or undone that can still ship can ship,
  or ship back.

A member that will never ship leaves by the first way alone, whichever kind it is: no
plan ships it.  After that release production holds it on neither side, so no later
release counts it unless a claim ships it again, and then the same way out stands.  No
card stands in for the leaves it was re-planned into: the delta review of 2026-10-14
built three histories in which such a stand-in, a member never back in production,
refused every later release.  The way out can meet the money rule's cap (a group holding
two money movers comes out in no one release): that is the developer's question, asked
at X-cx's piece L9d.

**What it cannot read refuses the release**, and nothing is declared after the cutover
(R-BAL287, R-BAL289):

- an old-form ``Ships: <arc>:<id>`` or ``Reopens: <arc>:<id>`` that a cut holding
  ``steps.md`` on ``dev``'s line in the window holds: the cutover's freeze ends with a
  release, so production held every one merged before the cutover (R-BAL287), and this
  one the freeze missed.  Only such a cut can judge it, so the refusal names the newest
  one, to release first with the release tool as that cut holds it.  Every other trailer
  is prose -- an old-form one merged after the cutover, a ``plan#N`` one, a value of
  neither form -- since a marker is the record and nothing after the cutover reads a
  trailer: refusing one would wedge every release over it, once no check refuses a
  trailer's shape before it lands (``R-BAL184``; X-cx's ``m2_plan.md`` s.3);
- a marker naming a card the tracker does not hold: CI's landing check refuses one before
  it lands (R-BAL289; ``tools/quill/landing.py``, its rule 7), so what reaches here is a
  card deleted after its marker landed;
- a marker naming a card of a kind no commit ships (a ruling, a question, a card of no
  type; quill's ``SHIPPABLE``): read as work it would pass as moving no money.  The landing
  check refuses one when it lands, so what reaches here was retyped since;
- an entry under ``plan/ships/`` that is no card's marker (a name that is no card number,
  a file in a directory below it), which the landing check refuses before it lands (its
  rule 1);
- a card an earlier cut's window names that the release's read does not hold (below).

**The tracker is read once, at the release's cut** (:func:`read`), and every earlier cut
offered in its place is judged with that read (:func:`carried`).  The read names each card
the cut's window names and each card whose marker any commit of ``<base>..<cut>`` changed
(quill's one walk), so it holds a card an earlier cut on the cut's first-parent line
shipped and the cut undid.  The walk lists a merge by its change against its first parent
alone, so a window can name a card no commit's listed change touched; an earlier cut whose
window names a card the read does not hold is refused, naming that card, and so never
offered: it is never judged as a card the tracker lacks.  The plan's
shapes (which steps are leaves, which will never ship) are read with what production
holds after the cut too, so an earlier cut is judged by the shapes the release's cut gives
its steps.

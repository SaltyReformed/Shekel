"""W9909's ruling for the cash-ledger leaf: every public name, classified.

The DATA of one registry entry, split out of :mod:`._fence_rulings` at plan
step ``balance:X-bi-6a``, for the reason that module was itself split out of
:mod:`.balance_seam` at ``balance:X-f3c-2b-2a``: a FAIL-CLOSED registry that
cannot grow refuses the next honest edit rather than the next unsafe one, and
the registry reached 1,007 lines against pylint's 1,000 ceiling the moment
this leaf gained ``planned_leg_contribution``.  The cash-ledger entry is the
largest by far -- every ingredient of a cash balance-at-T lives in that leaf,
so it carries the most rulings and the longest whys -- and it is the one that
grows with every balance step, so it is the one that leaves.

Nothing about the ruling moved: the names, their rationale and the EMPTY
producer set are verbatim, and :data:`._fence_rulings._FENCED_MODULE_RULINGS`
still keys the entry under ``"app.services.cash_ledger"`` so the checker's
prefix match (:func:`.balance_seam._fenced_module_ruling`) and every test over
the table are unchanged.  The scope set (:data:`._fence_rulings._CASH_LEDGER_MODULES`)
stays with the other scope sets, because the tests import them from one place.

The cash LEDGER leaf (plan steps D1a + D1c): the facts a cash balance is
folded from, what one row is WORTH, and what a set of rows SUMS TO.  Scoped
WHOLE for completeness but never call-allowlisted -- see
:data:`._fence_rulings._CASH_LEDGER_MODULES` for why, and why the scope is a
package rather than a list of modules.  The EMPTY producer set is the D3
invariant stated as data: a public balance producer outside the seam is not a
thing, so a new public name here is either ruled a NON-producer (with its why)
or it belongs inside ``balance_at`` -- there is no third classification.

    # The NON-RAISING twin of ``resolve_anchor``, added at plan step
    # X-f3a-1 for the reconcile panel: same row, same tie-breaks, same
    # ``_governing_row`` query, and the only difference is that "this
    # account has never had a balance declared" is an honest empty state to
    # a panel where it is a broken invariant to a reader.  It carries
    # ``resolve_anchor``'s ruling verbatim -- a stored user-asserted FACT,
    # not a computed projection.

    # ``load_balance_transactions`` carried this same ruling until plan step
    # X-g4b deleted it with the anchor-forward producer that was its last
    # caller.  It is the weaker of the two shapes, deliberately -- the
    # settled loader returns facts
    # already VALUED and DATED, while this one cannot date anything, because
    # a projected row's effective date is ``max(attribution, as_of + 1d)``
    # (ruling R-G) and this package reads no clock.  Rows in, rows out; the
    # dating, the valuation and the prefix-sum that make them a balance are

    # ``_amounts`` -- what ONE row is worth to checking.  An amount per
    # TRANSACTION is not a balance per ACCOUNT.  The cash analog of
    # ``loan_ledger``'s ``split_*`` rulings below, and carried for the same
    # reason.  The three-bucket reservation formula itself is NOT here:
    # D1c deleted its only external caller, so it went private and needs no
    # ruling -- structure retiring a fence entry, which is Phase D's point.
    #
    # **FOUR MORE ENTRIES WENT THE SAME WAY AT PLAN STEP X-au-d, and this
    # is the fence shrinking rather than being widened.**  The live-override
    # family this paragraph used to describe -- ``live_override``,
    # ``live_amounts`` and the ``income_amount`` rule that read them -- and
    # the ``display_amounts_by_id`` composition over them are all DELETED:
    # a paycheck row no longer stores a figure a live recompute has to
    # supersede, so there is no second answer for a screen to compose and
    # nothing left to classify.  What survives is ``amounts_by_id`` below,
    # which answers what a row's amount IS with no live half at all.
    # *The four names outlived the functions by one commit; CI's checker
    # step caught them, and the LOCAL suite structurally could not --
    # ``pytest.ini`` sets ``testpaths = tests``, so ``tools/pylint/tests``

    #
    # The VALUATION family (plan step X-au-c2) joins them on exactly that

    # resolved amount with the status, the soft delete and an entered
    # actual; ``contribution_of`` and ``contributions_by_id`` are the
    # one-row and batch forms that resolve first.  Each answers what ONE
    # ROW is worth -- none folds, dates, sums, or reads an anchor, and the
    # batch is a dict keyed by row id rather than anything per account.

    # panel.)
    # One TERM of that rule -- ``Sigma(credit entry amounts)`` for one
    # row -- published at plan step X-f2-c3 so the reconcile panel can print
    # what a STATEMENT shows beside what a tick books (finding **N-226**)

    # the statement matcher's corrected figure -- and two additions written
    # out is one place for them to drift; the panel is its one reader since

    "cash_leg_of",
    # The MOVEMENT's twin of ``cash_leg_of`` (plan step X-bi-3b,
    # ruling **R-BAL35**): what ONE purchase or covering movement moves
    # through its parent's account, its whole figure in the PARENT's
    # direction, total over the card partition and the contributing gate.
    # Six readers spelled ``-amount`` for themselves before it (the walk's
    # fact producer, the ledger writer's target, the seam's family valuation,

    "movement_cash_leg",
    # Its inverse (the sign rule is an involution): the figure a movement

    # bases reduce through -- the seam's fold and the retiring anchor-forward
    # walk -- which is what keeps one entries-aware expense rule and one

    # gone: both walks now advance their own sources against

    # ``observed_on`` and ``delta`` LEFT this set at plan step X-f3c-1 with

    # prefix sum and this package's producer set is empty and stays empty.

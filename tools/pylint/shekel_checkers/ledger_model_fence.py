"""Ledger-model import fence: ``shekel-ledger-model-bypass`` (W9908).

Flags any module OUTSIDE the posting-ledger service allowlist that IMPORTS a
posted-ledger row model -- ``Posting`` / ``JournalEntry`` / ``LedgerAccount``.
The posting ledger is append-only and balances through a deferred trigger
(``budget.assert_journal_entry_balanced``); every write goes through
``posting_service._emit_balanced_entry`` and every confirmed read through the
sanctioned reader packages (``posting_reads``, the loan / account posting
packages, the ledger report service). A consumer that holds one of these model
classes -- or the module that defines it -- can query the ledger, or
construct/mutate a row, OUTSIDE those seams: the exact bypass Build-Order
Steps 2-5 built the seams to prevent (``docs/audits/balance_architecture/``).
The fence is the import analog of the W9907 status-write fence (and of the
balance-producer read fence, which structure retired at plan step E1e): it binds
at the point a model (or its module) enters a module, where the name is still
visible, rather than at every downstream use.

It binds on two axes, so a module-path rename cannot slip a model class past it:

* by NAME -- importing ``Posting`` / ``JournalEntry`` / ``LedgerAccount`` by name
  is flagged wherever it is imported from (``from app.models import Posting`` --
  the F-1 package re-export; ``from app.models.journal_entry import Posting``;
  ``from ..models.journal_entry import Posting`` -- a relative path; an alias).
  The three class names are distinctive enough to carry no non-ledger collision
  (the precedent the balance-producer fence set for name-fencing);
* by MODULE -- binding a defining submodule reaches the model as
  ``<module>.Posting``, so ``from app.models.journal_entry import <anything>``
  (the whole ledger submodule is off-limits), ``from app.models import
  journal_entry`` (the submodule bound by name off the package), and the plain
  ``import app.models.journal_entry`` are each flagged.

Accepted boundaries (documented, not claimed closed): a bare ``import
app.models`` followed by attribute access ``app.models.Posting``, and a RELATIVE
submodule-by-name import ``from ..models import journal_entry``. Neither is an
idiom in the tree (cross-package imports are absolute; relative imports are
intra-package ``from ._sibling`` only), and reaching a model through either is
not written anywhere -- fencing them would risk false positives on ordinary
``import app.models`` for no real coverage. The NAME axis already catches the
relative CLASS import, which is the reachable relative shape.

"""Balance-seam fence residue: W9909, the fail-closed completeness check.

**The name-keyed CALL fence is gone.**  Plan step D3 cut it to one surface and
plan step E1e deleted that surface with its subject: structure does the whole
job now.  Every balance producer is a PRIVATE submodule of
``app.services.balance_at`` (plan steps D1/D-ctx/D-fold), the package-privacy
gate W9910 (``shekel-private-module-import``) plus stock ``protected-access``
make reaching one from outside the seam a hard failure in every import
spelling, and -- since E1e -- **no public balance producer exists outside the
seam at all**, so there is nothing left for a call allowlist to guard.  That is
also why the deletion cedes no coverage: measured on this tree, the two
spellings a consumer would actually write for the deleted posting readers now
rate E0611 (``no-name-in-module``) and E1101 (``no-member``), which are
hard-gated by ``--fail-on=E`` -- a stronger gate than the W9906 warning they
replace.

Named non-goal, shared with W9910: dynamic reflection (``importlib`` /
``getattr`` chains) is outside every static gate's sight -- a deliberate evader
was always one rename past the name fence too, so nothing is ceded there
either.

What remains is ONE check:

* **W9909, the completeness registry on the PUBLIC ingredient packages**
  (:data:`_FENCED_MODULE_RULINGS`).  "Is this new public function a balance
  producer?" is a human judgment no AST rule can decide, and these packages
  hold every ingredient of one (facts, splits, sums, schedules) OUTSIDE
  W9910's protection -- measured four times (N-28/N-31): a public balance-at-T
  born in one rates 10.00/10 with every other gate green.  The registry forces
  that judgment loudly at definition time.  Its rot direction is SAFE: a stale
  classification entry names a dead function (inert, and the reverse-staleness
  meta-test flags it); it can never permit a bypass.  Since E1e every scoped
  package's PRODUCER set is empty, which states the invariant as data: a new
  public name in one of them is either a ruled NON-producer (with its why) or
  it belongs inside ``balance_at`` -- there is no third classification.
  Resolves only if the read seam, write cluster, and shared leaves ever move
  under one private super-package boundary (recorded in the plan as a post-E1
  option).

# The balance-producer deny list and its one-package allowlist are GONE (plan
# step D3).  Every producer is a private ``balance_at`` submodule, so W9910
# already flags every import spelling from outside the seam and W0212 the
# attribute-access residual -- a name list here could only duplicate (and rot
# behind) the structural gate.  The seam-private W9909 rulings the moved
# producers carried (finding N-31's "travel") died with it, for the same
# reason: a producer born inside a private module is unreachable until someone
# deliberately re-exports it on the seam's public ``__init__``, which is the
# reviewed, one-place act the fence always wanted.
#
# The two genesis loan-ledger balance readers -- W9906's last surface, and the
# whole message with them -- are GONE at plan step E1e, deleted rather than
# fenced.  They answered balance-at-T from the WRITE cluster's own postings
# table, which is why they could not simply move inside the read seam; but by
# E1d-b they had no caller in ``app/`` at all (the resolver's confirmed slice
# seeds from the WALK, and ``confirmed_loan_view`` -- the injection seam the
# allowlist existed for -- was deleted), leaving only the reconciliation
# oracle's window onto the postings.  A window belongs on the ORACLE's side, so
# it moved to ``tests/_test_helpers.py`` and the production functions were
# deleted: no producer, no re-export, nothing to allowlist.  The loan FOLD had
# already left for the same structural reason at plan step D-fold
# (``fold_loan_balances`` / ``fold_from_walk`` into ``balance_at._fold``, the
# past-side twin of ``balance_at._plan_fold.fold_forward``), and ``walk_loan_ledger``
# came off to the leaf's NON-producer ruling because the walk yields only FACTS
# once the fold is elsewhere (see the ``loan_ledger`` ruling below).

# The loan RESOLVER call-fence and the context-memo handle fence are GONE (plan
# step D3), because plan step D2a removed their reason at the ROOT:
# ``LoanState.current_balance`` -- the balance-at-today that made a resolver
# bundle a leak -- is DELETED, so ``resolve_loan_bundle`` / ``resolve_loan_seeded``
# hand back schedule detail of the same sanctioned class ``debt_schedule_rows``
# already exposes.  Plan step E1d-a then moved that whole read INSIDE the seam
# as the private ``balance_at._resolution``, re-exported nowhere, so W9910 is the
# only gate it needs and its completeness scope deleted with it (its
# ``resolve_loan_seeded`` half folded away at E1d-b); the context memo went with
# it, leaving ``BalanceContext.loan_walk``, which hands back the leaf's
# public FACTS (``walk_loan_ledger`` is a ruled NON-producer).  A consumer that
# wants a loan's balance still has exactly one way to get it --
# ``balance_at.balance_at`` -- but by construction now, not by list.

# ── Fail-closed completeness (W9909) ────────────────────────────────
#
# The rulings themselves -- every scope set and every classification with
# its why -- live in :mod:`._fence_rulings`, which is DATA this module
# looks up.  They were inline until plan step ``balance:X-f3c-2b-2a``,
# when this file stood at EXACTLY pylint's 1000-line ceiling and a
# FAIL-CLOSED registry had five names to add: a gate whose answer table
# cannot grow refuses the next honest edit rather than the next unsafe
# one.  The checker changes when the RULE changes; the registry changes
# whenever a scoped package gains a public name, which is far more often.
#
# Only what this module READS.  The eight scope sets moved with the table and
# are imported by ``shekel_checkers/__init__.py`` from their new home rather
# than re-exported through here, so the split leaves no pass-through name whose
# only job is to make a move invisible.

    """Return whether ``node`` is a PUBLIC name a consumer outside the module can call.

    A name is reachable from outside when it is public AND every scope enclosing
    it is a public CLASS, all the way up to the Module.  That admits, and the
    second of these is the shape the original check missed:

    * a public TOP-LEVEL function, and
    * a public METHOD of a public class (including a method of a public class
      nested in a public class) -- reachable as ``SomeClass(...).method(...)``,
      which is exactly how ``BalanceContext.loan`` handed routes a ``ResolvedLoan``
      with the fence silent.

    Excluded: any private name (leading underscore) at any level -- a private
    class's methods are unreachable because a consumer cannot name the class -- and
    anything nested inside a FUNCTION, which is unreachable from outside. Dunders
    fall out of the same underscore test: ``__post_init__`` is a lifecycle hook,
    not an export. ``@property`` / ``@classmethod`` / ``@staticmethod`` / ``async``
    are all ordinary FunctionDefs here and are all covered.

    **The walk is up the ANCESTOR CHAIN, not a fixed one- or two-level test.**  A

    drops a method of a nested class, and a bare ``parent is Module`` test drops a

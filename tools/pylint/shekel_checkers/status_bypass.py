# Status seam (W9907): the single attribute the transaction status seam owns.
# Every non-transfer ``Transaction.status_id`` assignment must go through
# ``status_seam.apply_status_change``; only the seam's own module and the ONE
# transfer-service leaf that CONSTRUCTS a transfer and its two shadow rows may
# write it directly. Matched syntactically by attribute
# name -- precise because ``Transaction`` / ``Transfer`` are the only models with
# a ``status_id`` column (``filing_status_id`` on the tax tables is a different
# attribute and is not matched). Listed by fully-qualified module name, matched
# exactly or as a package prefix by :func:`_module_in_allowlist`.
#
# The transfer entry NARROWED from ``app.services.transfer_service`` to that
# package's ``_create`` leaf at plan step X-f2-c3, and the narrowing is the
# point rather than a tidy-up: the module became a PACKAGE there (findings
# N-152 / N-156), and prefix matching would have silently extended this
# exemption over all eight of its leaves -- an allowlist widening nobody
# decided on, which is the failure mode a fence exists to prevent. ``_create``
# holds both writes that need it (``Transaction(status_id=...)`` in
# ``_build_shadow`` and ``Transfer(status_id=...)`` in ``create_transfer``);
# every other leaf reaches the column through the seam. Plan step X-aj2 makes
# the write door structural and deletes the entry.
#
# The SEAM entry narrowed the same way and for the same reason at plan step
# X-au-c3, when ``status_seam`` became a package: ``_seam`` holds
# ``apply_status_change``, the one function here that assigns the column, while
# ``_record`` (the settlement value and its reads) and ``_refusals`` (the
# invariants as guards) write nothing at all. Naming the package would have
# re-run the widening this comment already records one entry down.

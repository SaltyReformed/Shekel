"""W9909's classification registry: which public names are NOT producers.

The DATA half of the balance-seam fence.  :mod:`.balance_seam` holds the
checker -- what W9909 asks and where it asks it -- and this holds the answers
it looks up.

**Why they are two modules** (plan step ``balance:X-f3c-2b-2a``).  W9909 is
FAIL-CLOSED: every public top-level function in a scoped package must be
explicitly classified, so this registry grows whenever any of those packages
gains a name, while the checker beside it changes only when the RULE changes.
Held together they put a monotonically growing table inside a file with
pylint's 1000-line ceiling over it -- and that ceiling BOUND, at exactly 1000,
the first time a step added five names.  A fail-closed gate whose registry
cannot grow refuses the next honest edit rather than the next unsafe one,
which is a fence that has stopped being structural.

Nothing else moved with it: the scope sets, the rulings and every rationale are
here verbatim, and :mod:`.balance_seam` imports the two names it reads.

**The ceiling bound a second time at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6a``** (1,007
lines when the cash-ledger leaf gained one name), and the same remedy applied
one level down: the cash-ledger entry's NAMES and their whys -- the largest
ruling in the table and the one every balance step grows -- live in
:mod:`._fence_rulings_cash_ledger`, and the entry below composes them.  The
table, its keys and every scope set are still here, so the checker and the
tests over it read one place.

# ── Fail-closed completeness (W9909) ────────────────────────────────
#
# A name-keyed deny list fails OPEN: a new function added inside a covered
# module is unguarded by default until a human remembers to list it.  That is
# not a hypothetical -- it shipped twice (``investment_base_balance_map``,
# ``loan_owed_at_dates``: each called past the seam with the fence silent), and
# the same hole was re-measured four more times during Phase D (findings
# N-28 / N-31).  Two identical misses is a design defect in the FENCE, not a
# lapse in diligence, so the default is inverted here: every PUBLIC top-level
# function defined in a scoped module must be explicitly classified as either a
# producer (fenced) or a non-producer (deliberately callable), and one that is
# neither is an error AT ITS DEFINITION -- the moment it is typed, in the same
# per-edit hook run.  A producer can no longer slip through by omission;
# forgetting is now the loud path.  Since plan step E1e every scoped package's
# PRODUCER set is empty, so the only classification a new public name here can
# legitimately receive is NON-producer: if it answers balance-at-T it belongs
# inside ``balance_at`` as a private submodule instead.
#
# Scope (the D3 residue): the PUBLIC packages that hold balance INGREDIENTS
# outside W9910's protection -- the two genesis loan-ledger packages (the
# posting attribution reads and the walk they are built on), the cash ledger
# leaf, the loan resolver tier and its db-facing seeding module, and the
# account-kind classifier.  The ``balance_at`` seam package is deliberately NOT
# scoped: its public functions ARE the seam entries every consumer is supposed
# to call, so "unclassified" is meaningless there, and its private submodules
# are W9910's.  ``ledger_report_service`` is not scoped either, and that one is
# a measured GAP rather than a ruling (finding N-35: a public balance-at-T born
# there rates 10.00/10 with every gate silent) -- closing it is its own step,
# because every public name in that package must then be classified.
# Classes themselves are not scoped -- the historical misses were functions, and
# a dataclass (``AnchorPoint`` / ``CashLedgerWalk``) is data the seam folds over,
# not an answer to "what is the balance at T".  Their public METHODS ARE scoped
# (see :func:`_is_public_export_surface`), which is why ``visible_on`` and
# ``delta`` carry rulings below.
#
# The non-producer rulings are keyed BY MODULE, not pooled into one flat set.
# A pooled set would let a name ruled harmless in one module silently exempt a
# same-named function later added to another (``dated_deltas``,
# ``income_amount``, ``resolve_anchor`` are all generic enough to collide -- the
# first is in fact ruled TWICE below, once per ledger leaf) -- which is the same
# fail-open shape, one level down.  Each module owns its own ruling.
# The five SEAM-PRIVATE ENGINE rulings are GONE (plan step D3).  They existed
# only as N-31's "travel": a name-keyed fence could not see a producer born
# inside the seam, so each moved module kept a classification entry UNTIL the
# package boundary became structural.  D-gate shipped (W9910): a private
# ``balance_at`` submodule cannot be imported from outside the package in any
# spelling, so a producer born there is unreachable until someone re-exports it
# on the seam's public ``__init__`` -- the deliberate, reviewed act the
# classification existed to force.  The ``balance_at`` package itself stays
# deliberately un-scoped: its public functions ARE the seam entries every
# consumer calls.
#
# ``_context`` is the ONE seam-private module whose ruling SURVIVES D3, because
# the engine rationale above does not reach it (D3's own adversarial review
# measured the gap): ``BalanceContext`` is already re-exported on the seam's
# public ``__init__``, so a new public METHOD on it reaches every route holder
# with NO ``__init__`` edit -- a probe ``ctx.balance_now(account)`` folding the
# memoized walk rated 10.00/10 with the ruling deleted.  W9910 sees imports,
# never attribute access on an object a consumer legitimately holds, so W9909
# is the only gate on this module's surface; a producer belongs in a private
# seam MODULE, never on the context.

# review proved that conflating them opens the exact hole W9909 exists to
# close.  Measured: a new
# public ``running_balance_map`` folded from ``resolve_anchor`` +
# ``period_subtotals`` + ``round_money`` (that reduction has since been deleted
# at plan step X-c2b3; ``sum_projected`` is the surviving one, and the probe

# rated 10.00/10, AND so did a route consuming it.  A real balance-at-T on a

#
# This leaf is the likeliest birthplace of the next one: it holds every

# account is an event stream") builds the cash fold directly on top of it.
#
# **It is ONE package key, and that is the point (plan step D1c).**  Until D1c
# these names lived in two flat modules (``cash_events`` / ``period_flows``)
# plus five stranded inside ``balance_calculator``, so the scope had to be a
# hand-written LIST -- which fails open exactly one level up: creating a sibling
# module is how you escape a module-keyed gate (finding N-28, and Section 8's
# "a fail-CLOSED gate is scoped by module identity").  A package is matched by
# PREFIX (:func:`_fenced_module_ruling`), so a submodule added inside it is
# scoped the day it is written, with no constant to remember.  Same shape as

# The account-KIND classifier (plan step D1b).  Same asymmetry as the cash-event
# sources above, reached from the other direction: it came OFF the W9906
# allowlist (it calls no producer) and STAYED scoped here.  It is not a cash
# event source, so it carries its own constant rather than joining that set --
# each scope entry names the reason it exists.
#
# **This is the canonical rationale for that entry; the registry entry below and
# the module's own docstring point HERE rather than restating it.**  D1b as
# planned deleted BOTH memberships, and dropping this one was measured unsafe:
#
#   * the module DEFINED the loan forward-projection producers through all of
#     Phase C and shed the last at ``f445aa77``, ONE DAY before D1b -- so "it
#     holds no producer" is a fact about a very recent tree, not a property; and
#   * a module's reachability surface is its PARAMETERS, not its imports.
#     ``classify_account`` takes a live ORM ``Account``, so a public
#     ``balance_on(account, target)`` folding ``account.transactions`` needs no
#     import this module lacks.  Measured with the entry dropped: that function,
#     and a route rendering it, both rated 10.00/10.
#
# What W9909 actually covers is public FUNCTIONS and public METHODS of public
# classes (see :func:`_is_public_export_surface`).  It does not see a balance
# computed in a dunder and exposed as an attribute, nor a module-level alias of a
# private function -- both rate 10.00/10 here and in every other scoped module.

# The producer-free half of the cash valuation (plan step X-au-c2).  It was

# needs ``settled_contribution`` and could never import that package: its
# ``_amount_source`` reached UP into ``loan_payment_service`` for amount rule
# 4's producer, so any loan-stack module naming ``cash_ledger`` closed an import
# cycle.  ``cash_ledger`` re-exports ``settled_contribution``, the only one of
# the three that was ever public, so no consumer moved.  *It was named
# ``owned_contribution`` until plan step X-bx, which deleted its fall-through
# onto the plan column and renamed it for the assertion that survived.*
#
# **THAT REACH IS GONE as of plan step X-au-g-2a**, which moved rule 4's
# producer into ``cash_ledger`` -- so the loan stack CAN name that package now,
# and this module's split is no longer forced by an import cycle.  The scope
# entry stays for the reason stated below (a fenced module's contents extracted
# into an unfenced neighbour is the N-28 shape), which never depended on the
# cycle; whether the module itself should fold back into ``cash_ledger`` is a
# separate question this step deliberately did not take, and it is not answered
# by silence here.
#
# **It is scoped here the day it is created, and that is the whole N-28
# lesson applied to its own remedy.**  This module's rationale for keying the
# cash ledger on a PACKAGE says a fail-closed gate is escaped by adding a
# sibling -- and a new TOP-LEVEL module is that escape one level further out.
# Extracting a fenced module's contents into an unfenced neighbour would have
# silently un-ruled ``settled_contribution``, which is the exact shape (a fence
# that fails open when the code moves) findings N-28 / N-31 are about.  A flat

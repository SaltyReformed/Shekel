"""X-cx's migration, its VERIFY: whether the tracker holds what the registries make, both ways
(the L7 design's draft 4 s.5).  It reads, and writes nothing.

**ONE grading.**  The tracker is graded by the plan every run converges on
(:func:`_migrate_plan.plan`): it must refuse nothing and leave nothing to write.  So each
item has exactly one card, by key, of its kind, labels and milestone; open, or for a ruling
closed; its mark removed; under its parent, blocked by its blockers and no others; on the
board where it has a place; its title equal, and its body and As filed comment equal under
:func:`_migrate_bodies.masked`, which leaves out the As filed commit alone, to the text a
run files (``migrate.prepare``: built, then each bare ``#N`` written as the input file
decides, R-BAL277), so a number left bare where a marker or a link was decided is a
difference; a question holding exactly one such comment, and no other card any.  A card
filed already is graded on its kind, labels, links and state, and every card no item
claims must be the tracker's own.  Each difference is named in the words the plan's
refusals use; a second grading here would be a second spelling of what a finished
migration is (rule 14).

**What no plan grades** is graded here, once the plan refuses nothing and leaves nothing to
write:

- the board's ORDER, which a run sets after the plan's writes: it must be
  :func:`_migrate_plan.desired_board`'s;
- each card's As filed COMMIT, which :func:`_migrate_bodies.masked` leaves out: it must
  ``resolve`` (the caller's predicate: the full id of a commit this checkout's HEAD
  descends from), and its item's row there must write what this checkout's row writes
  (``rows_at``, the caller's: :func:`_migrate_bodies.row_texts`, over the one producer of
  what a row writes on its card, :func:`_migrate_bodies.row_text`, run on that commit's
  rows with no input file).  A card's As filed block claims the text its item's ROW
  makes, as that commit's registries hold the row: the lead (a step's sentence, a
  finding's cell, a ruling's rule, a question's question where the input file writes
  none) and the block's cells -- so a reader finds that text there once the registries
  are gone.  It claims nothing else: the input file's work (the card's name, a step's
  spec and the paragraphs given to it, a written question) is not versioned, so it is no
  commit's to quote, and the plan grades it against this checkout's (review 8, MEDIUM-1:
  a whole card rebuilt at its commit under today's input file only approximates its run,
  and refused a true quote whenever a note had changed since); nor anything the ranks
  derive -- a step's rank, which places its card, and its ``starts`` cell's head, which
  its block does not quote -- so a tick that only renumbers ranks moves no card's claim
  (the coordinator's ruling on review 10, LOW-1).  The plan, graded first, holds the card
  to this checkout's text but the commit, so the card says what its commit's row writes
  exactly where that row and this checkout's write the same, which is what is compared:
  no part of the card is read back for it (review 9, MEDIUM-1: the block, compared alone,
  left each lead unclaimed);

and on any read, each milestone's DESCRIPTION, which the plan finds by its title alone: it
must be the input file's.

**What it grades is every fact a registry ROW an item is made from, the OUTCOMES table, or
the input file states about a card or a milestone** (the coordinator's rulings on review
10, MEDIUM-1, and review 11, MEDIUM-2).  What it does not grade, each for its reason, is
first a field a write leaves at GitHub's default, or sets only as a by-product, which is no
such fact:

- who last closed or reopened a card: ``close_unmarked`` closes each ruling as the App,
  which GitHub records as its closer (``Card.closed_by_tool``, ``_tracker.py:401``), but a
  ruling closed as completed is a record whoever closed it (R-BAL206);
- a card's author, the App by ``create``, which no registry names and the read does not
  fetch;
- the ORDER of a card's sub-issues (a container's steps, a step's findings), the order
  ``add_child`` filed them in: a by-product (the same ruling).  The order the registries
  set is the board's (R-BAL238: the steps by rank, then the questions by the ledger's
  order), graded above; which cards are a card's sub-issues is graded as each one's
  parent;
- a milestone's state, which ``create_milestone`` leaves open, and its due date: the input
  file gives a milestone its title and description alone;
- a comment's hidden (minimized) state, which the read does not fetch: a hidden As filed
  comment is graded as a shown one;
- a person's comment, or any comment of the App's but a question's As filed one: no
  registry writes one;
- a card's link BLOCKING an issue outside the tracker (the read takes a card's blockers,
  not what it blocks), its assignees, lock, pin and reactions: no write of the
  migration's sets one, and the read does not fetch them;
- its items on other projects, which the read fetches and discards
  (``_tracker.py:102``, ``:372-375``): only its place on this board is graded;

and then what a registry or the input file states that no card of the migration's holds:

- a card filed already's text and milestone (:data:`_migrate_source.MAPPED`; X-cx's own
  card today): its own, which the migration does not rewrite, so it is graded on its kind,
  labels, links and state alone (above);
- the steps-section paragraphs the input file gives a disposition of ``dropped``, ``rule``
  or ``reasoning``, and the ``home`` it names: no card carries them (L8 places them), and
  ``_migrate_input`` holds each entry to its one paragraph's text, by hash
  (``_migrate_input.py:361``), and grades its form; and the registries' prose outside
  their tables, on no card either;
- what an OUTCOMES row's scope cell holds but its keys -- each key's annotation, and any
  part naming no key: its milestone's membership, and the hash the input file holds it to
  (``_migrate_input.py:413``), read its keys alone.  Latent: no live scope cell holds any
  (0 of 6, 2026-10-12);
- the ORDER of the OUTCOMES rows, the outcomes' priority: no milestone holds it, as
  R-BAL243 keeps it in the board's order, which is the ranks', graded above; nothing here
  holds the ranks to it;
- a step's ``starts`` cell's HEAD, which the ranks derive (the plan gate recomputes it,
  and verify runs no plan gate): no card quotes it (above), and the board's order and the
  blocked-by links carry what it says.

**The tracker's own cards are LISTED**: once the plan refuses nothing, every card that is
no item's, so a reader sees which cards the migration let be.

**Not re-run here: the census of the fetched bodies** (:func:`_migrate_bodies.census`).
Once the plan refuses nothing, each fetched body equals its built one but for line ends,
the space around it and its As filed commit, and ``migrate`` runs nothing while the
census refuses a built body, so the census of the fetched bodies would be the census of
the built ones, and a re-run would measure nothing.

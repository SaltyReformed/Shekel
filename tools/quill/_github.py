"""The one HTTP path quill takes to GitHub, under either of two identities.

The private tracker (ruling ``balance:R-BAL170``) is written by two identities
on purpose.  The developer's own login -- the token ``gh`` already holds --
configures the tracker (:mod:`setup_tracker`).  Every CARD write goes through
quill's GitHub App instead, a separate identity, so a check can tell a
tool write from the developer's own edit and never act on his.

An App proves who it is with a JSON Web Token signed by its private key, and
trades that token for an installation token, which quill narrows to the one
repository it reads and writes (:func:`installation_token`).  The signing is
done here with ``cryptography`` (pinned in ``requirements.txt``) rather than a
JWT package, because RS256 over two JSON segments is the whole of what the App
flow needs.

**A redirect is an error, never followed.**  GitHub answers 301 for an issue
transferred to another repository and for a renamed repository; followed, a read
would describe another repository's issue as the tracker's, and a write would
land where it was not aimed (``requests`` re-sends a 307 or 308 with its body).
So no request follows one, and any 3xx is raised like a 4xx.

**A rate limit is waited out, as GitHub's documentation directs, and then STOPS.**
A refusal for a rate limit (:func:`_rate_limited`) is re-sent after the wait the
answer names -- ``retry-after``; else, with ``x-ratelimit-remaining`` at zero,
until ``x-ratelimit-reset`` -- or else after a minute doubled per retry, and after
:data:`RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES` waits quill stops: "Continuing to make requests while
you are rate limited may result in the banning of your integration" (both REST
and GraphQL pages, read 2026-10-09).  GitHub's pages do not say whether a request
refused for a rate limit was performed; they say to retry it, and quill does.

**Quill never re-sends sooner than GitHub's answer asks, so a wait it cannot honour
STOPS it instead** (:func:`_wait_seconds`): a ``retry-after`` or reset it cannot
read as a time (not a number of seconds or an HTTP date, negative, or not finite),
and a wait that would carry one request's waits past :data:`RATE_LIMIT_BUDGET_SECONDS`.
Shortening the wait would be the early retry GitHub warns can ban the integration;
a stop costs a re-run, and every quill command finishes what a stopped run left.

Nothing in this module reads or writes the code repository.  Its tests feed it
recorded responses and never call GitHub.

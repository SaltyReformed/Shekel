"""A tracker's place, its board's fence, the whole-card listing, the numbering probe and the
paged title search (X-cx L7), against scripted GitHub answers; nothing calls GitHub.

No recording holds these reads yet: the rehearsal tracker they are for does not exist,
and the real tracker's own reads are kept on the real tracker's scratch cards only
(``_recorded``).  So, as ``test__tracker.py`` does for an answer no scratch card can give,
each test starts from a RECORDED node where one exists and changes only what it is
about, and says so; the real tracker's query text staying byte-identical is graded by
``test__tracker.py``'s replays, which match every request word for word.

"""``quill export``, the tracker's daily backup, against GitHub answers RECORDED from the
live tracker.

``recorded/export.json`` was kept 2026-10-21 09:15 EDT by a session that ran the export's
:func:`_export.snapshot` once against the real tracker (twelve cards, none of them
scratch, so every card's text in it is redacted), then three reads of card #2 the export
did not need -- its saved versions, its comments read with the export's fields, and its
first comment's saved versions -- which the tests of a connection longer than one page
start from.  Every read went through ``_recorded.Recorder``, which sends no write.  A
test that needs an answer no card on the tracker gives (a hundred saved versions or
comments, an edited comment, a card cut short) starts from a recorded answer, changes the
one field it is about, and says so.  Nothing here calls GitHub.

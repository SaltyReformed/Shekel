"""The GraphQL text of each read quill makes of a tracker: the fields of a card, each
listing of cards, a card's histories, and the board's order and links.

What pins each text: the recordings (``_recorded.Replay``) replay most of them word for
word, so a change to one no longer matches its recording: re-record it, never edit an
answer by hand.  Two no recording holds: :func:`all_cards` (its milestone is graded by
``test__tracker_place.py``) and :data:`BARE_CARD_FIELDS` (graded against the recorded
lookup, less its board items, by ``test__tracker_card_reader.py``).

Split out of :mod:`_tracker`, which sends them and reads their answers, at X-cx L9d's
card-only reader, whose change would otherwise take that module past the 1,000 lines
``too-many-lines`` allows.  The lookups of cards by number compose these fields there,
and the board's writes stay there beside :meth:`_tracker.Board._write`, the one door they
are sent through.

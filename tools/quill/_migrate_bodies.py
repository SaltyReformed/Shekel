"""X-cx's migration, its CARDS' TEXT: each item's title, body and comment, and the census.

What each card says (the L7 design's draft 4 s.3):

- a **step**: its ``steps.md`` sentence; ``## Spec``; its entry in its arc document,
  with every paragraph the input file calls a ``note`` taken out FIRST, then DEDENTED by
  its checkbox line's indentation (a line still left of it is refused, V3-2) and the
  checkbox's box dropped, so ``- [ ] **X-h** ...`` opens as ``**X-h** ...``; then each
  steps-section paragraph the input file gives this card (R-BAL245's ``card-body``);
- a **finding**: its ``ledger.md`` cell;
- a **question**: ONLY the developer's question -- the row's note word for word, or the
  question the input file wrote for it (R-BAL241) -- so ``quill file ruling
  --from-question`` takes exactly that; the row's other cells go in ONE comment opening
  :data:`AS_FILED`;
- a **ruling**: its ``rulings.md`` cell.

Every card but a question ends with an **As filed block** (:meth:`RowText.block`), and a
question's As filed comment holds one: a fenced quotation, word for word, of the row's
cells the card carries nowhere else (its lead opens the body: a step's sentence, a
finding's or a ruling's cell; a question's question, its row's note, is quoted inside its
``owner`` cell too), and first the registry and commit it was filed from.  A step's
``starts`` cell is quoted by its STORED part alone, as ``blocked by``: its blockers and
their prose, every aside and annotation whole (``StepRow.starts_stored``), never its head,
which the ranks derive (the coordinator's rulings on review 10, LOW-1, and review 11,
MEDIUM-1).  A fence renders nothing and links no ``#N``; the links and labels govern, and
the block is a quotation.  The TEXT a card's row writes
-- its lead (a question's where the input file writes none) and the block's cells --
comes from ONE producer, :func:`row_text`, which :func:`build` composes each card from.
Besides its structure (its kind, links and milestone, which the plan grades, and its board
place: the plan grades that it is on the board, ``migrate verify`` its order), two parts
of a card are made from its row OUTSIDE it, and graded apart, against this checkout only:
its title's alias (``Item.alias``, the row's id), which is its key, so a
card is found by it (``_migrate_plan.card_key``, ``_migrate_plan.py:179``) and its title
is compared exactly (:func:`differences`); and its labels (``Item.labels``: the arc's, and
for a step ``moves-money`` from its sentence, ``_migrate_source.step_labels``,
``_migrate_source.py:480``), which the plan holds equal to the item's
(``_migrate_plan._Grading._unlike``, ``_migrate_plan.py:655``).

Each card is held to quill's one check (:func:`check.violations`) with ``changed`` =
{title} (draft 4 s.3): its kind, its one arc label and its short title.

**The census is computed from the BUILT bodies** (draft 4 s.11 V3-2): every non-blank
line of each arc's steps section is put in exactly one place -- on a card, a note that
moves nowhere, a shipped step's pointer, the card already filed for X-cx
(:data:`_migrate_source.MAPPED`, whose text is not rewritten), a heading, or a paragraph
kept for L8 by its disposition -- and each step card's body is read back
(:func:`step_regions`): its sentence and its As filed block must be exactly what its row
makes (:func:`row_text`), and the NON-BLANK lines of its spec and of each given paragraph
must be the lines put on it, region by region and in order, none missing, none doubled and
nothing else
(:func:`census`).  A non-blank line the assembly lost, misplaced or added is a refusal,
whatever the spans say.

**What the census does not grade** (review of PR #546, LOW 2): BLANK lines, so a
paragraph break the assembly dropped or added (two paragraphs merged, one split) passes
it; and the DEDENT, which the census reads through the same :func:`dedent` the builder
writes with, so a wrong one is wrong on both sides alike.  The dedent is graded by its own
tests; the stored text, every blank line and indent of it, by ``migrate verify``, which
holds each fetched body EQUAL to its built one (draft 4 s.5).

"""The ``quill export`` command: the plan's tracker backed up whole, one file a day.

Ruling ``balance:R-BAL328`` (item 3): a daily backup of the cards runs from the cutover's
first day -- one export of every card, edit and comment per day, to the disk restic backs
up.  ``quill export --to DIR`` writes ``DIR/shekel-plan-<date>.json``, the date the export
began in UTC; run again the same day, its file replaces that day's.  It is meant to run
daily from a timer on the host, whose unit files live with the host's other timers, not
in this repository.

**What a file holds.**  The cards and milestones as GitHub answered them, so no reader's
idea of a card stands between the backup and the tracker; the board and the claims as
quill reads them:

- ``cards``: every card, open and closed, in number order (:func:`_queries.export_cards`):
  what quill reads of a card, its text, who filed it and when, when it closed, its
  milestone's number, every saved version of its text, and every comment, with every
  saved version of its own when it was edited.  Its saved versions and its comments are
  each kept as ``{"nodes": [...]}``, every node, read to the end
  (:func:`_github.paged`).
- ``milestones``: every milestone, open and closed, whole (:func:`_queries.milestones`).
- ``board``: the tracker's cards on the board, in the developer's drag order (R-BAL177),
  which no card holds (:meth:`_tracker.Board.order`).
- ``claims``: which branch is building which card, since when, and the claim's commit
  (:meth:`_tracker.Tracker.claims`).
- ``tracker`` and ``taken_at``: whose cards, and when the export began.

**What it does not hold:** a card's timeline -- its title's renames, its labels and its
state over time -- which each day's file shows as its difference from the day before's;
a label's colour and description, which :mod:`setup_tracker` states in code; and an item
on the board that is not one of the tracker's cards.

**A file under a day's name is always whole.**  It is written under a hidden temporary
name beside it, synced, then renamed into place.  The temporary file is made before
anything is read, so a directory that cannot be written fails at once; a run that fails
before the rename leaves no file and every earlier day's as it was, and a run killed by
a signal mid-write leaves its hidden ``.partial`` file, never a file under a day's name.
Any failed read -- GitHub, the network, or a card or connection GitHub answers cut short
or null (:func:`_tracker.card_from`, :func:`_tracker.connection_nodes`) -- and any
failed write end the command with exit status 2 (``quill.py``'s module docstring): one
bad read costs that night's file, and the timer's alert says so.  The file is its
owner's to read only: the tracker is private, and its cards may hold real figures
(R-BAL172).

It reads through quill's App, as every quill command does, and writes nothing to the
tracker.

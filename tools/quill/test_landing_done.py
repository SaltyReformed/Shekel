"""CI's landing check, rule 8 (rulings ``balance:R-BAL385`` and ``R-BAL390``): a marker a
change leaves as it was may not change what dev and main together say of its card; and rule 1
read as every reader of the markers reads them.

Rule 8 compares what BEFORE (the merge of the change's first parent with the other
integration branch) and AFTER (the merge of the change with it) say of each card: not
shipped, or shipped on a line.  Its first case is X-cx L8's resync probe
(``plan-tracker-2026-10-23/m3_resync_probe.md``, measured 2026-10-23): a resync built by hand
that keeps the marker ``main``'s hotfix deleted, which writes nothing on ``dev``'s line and so
passed every rule that reads what a change writes.  R-BAL390 widened it to L1's review's two
near-misses (``plan-tracker-2026-10-23/l1_review_probes/p3.py`` and ``p4.py``): a resync built
by hand keeping a line ``main`` undid where ``main`` shipped the card again, and one dropping
the marker of a hotfix ``main`` holds.  R-BAL391 re-heard the second: a delete passes where a
commit the change brings shows it in a change of its own, no merge (the widening's review,
``plan-tracker-2026-10-23/l1_widening_review_probes/p_revert_in_branch.py``: a revert made in a
branch that merged the other in).  Every history is built and judged by the builders
``test_landing.py`` shares (:mod:`tools.quill._histories`); no test here reads the tracker.

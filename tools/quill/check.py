"""The one check a card passes before it is written, whoever writes it.

Quill runs it before it sends a card (``quill file``) and refuses to
send what fails.  The tracker's Action (step X-cx's leaf L6) runs the SAME
function on a card the developer files or edits by hand, and comments on what
fails without reverting it -- so the two hold a card to one set of rules.  What
each passes in can differ, never the rules: whether the owner is still work
(:attr:`Owner.live`), which quill reads from git and the cards
(``_state.is_live``) and the Action from whatever it reads; and ``changed``, the
parts a change writes, which a new card's filing and a hand edit name
differently.

What it holds a card to (rulings ``balance:R-BAL136``, ``R-BAL138``,
``R-BAL177``, ``R-BAL178``, ``R-BAL179`` and ``R-BAL180``):

- always: its type is one of the four kinds, and it carries exactly one arc
  label;
- a title the change writes is a short name: present, and at most
  :data:`TITLE_CAP` characters;
- a parent the change sets is the owner its kind needs: a finding's is a LIVE
  step (a finding names a live owner), a ruling's is a step, and a step's, if
  it has one, is the LIVE step it splits (a step already done with has no work
  left to split); a parent with no type is no step, whatever the kind;
- a body the change writes is capped: a finding's is one sentence of at most
  400 characters, and a ruling's is :func:`ruling_body`'s shape -- the
  developer's question, then his answer -- at most 2,000 characters in all.
  That they are HIS words, word for word, is the filer's duty; no check can see
  it.

**Only what a change writes is graded** (``R-BAL136``: "rows nobody edits keep
their text until they close").  A caller names the parts it writes in
``changed``; a new card writes all of them (:data:`NEW_CARD`).  So a migrated
ruling that names no owner, or a finding whose owner has since shipped, is
not refused when only its labels change.

Real production figures are ALLOWED in the private tracker (``R-BAL172``), so
nothing here looks for them.  Nothing here reads GitHub: a caller describes
the card as a :class:`Draft`.  Until step X-cx's cutover (L8) deletes the plan
gate's registry arms, ``tools/plan_gate/_rulings.RULINGS_ROW_CAP`` spells
R-BAL136's 2,000 again, for a ``rulings.md`` row.

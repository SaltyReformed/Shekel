"""A small plan for the migration's tests: registries, arc documents and an input file.

The live registries move every day and are graded by the plan gate's own suite; the
migration's tests read this corpus instead, which holds one of each shape the source,
the input file and the cards' text must handle (each named where it is written), and
:func:`complete_input` writes the input file a session would, hashing each entry's
source text exactly as :mod:`_migrate_input` grades it.  Nothing here reads a file.

"""CI's landing check (X-cx M2): the one write rule over the ship markers a pull request's merge
writes, and the tracker's word on each card a change records; nothing calls GitHub.

Every history is a throwaway repository's, built and judged by the builders this module shares
with rule 8's (:mod:`tools.quill._histories`): its markers written as files and its merges
REAL ones, judged as CI judges one: the merge of the pull request's head into its base's tip
(:func:`_check`).  The
tracker is read through the REAL card-only reader (:class:`_tracker.CardReader`, review O3 of
a1b), so each card it judges is a :class:`_tracker.BareCard` built by ``card_from`` from a node
in the shape GitHub answers a read without the board, and a decision that reached for a board
item would raise.  The nodes are built by :func:`_card`, whose shape is held key for key to
the recorded lookup's (:func:`test_the_nodes_are_shaped_as_github_answers_the_reader`).  The
pull request is read through a stand-in for GitHub's answer (:func:`_pull`), and its own read
from GitHub's answer is graded apart (:func:`landing.pull_request`).

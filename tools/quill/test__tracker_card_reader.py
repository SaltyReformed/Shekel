"""The card-only reader (X-cx L9d a1b): cards read by number and without the board, by a
token that may read the tracker's issues and nothing else; nothing calls GitHub.

Each test of a read starts from the RECORDED lookup of cards #1, #2, #11, #12, #13 and
#99999 (the one ``test__tracker.py``'s ``cards`` replay reads), as ``test__tracker_place.py``
does, and changes only what it is about, and says so; the board decisions' test builds its
cards by hand.  The recording was kept before the App's rename
(R-BAL227), so its App is ``shekel-plan-tool``.

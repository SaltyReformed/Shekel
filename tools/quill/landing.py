"""Refuse a pull request whose merge writes a ship marker, or a task's done file, it may not:
CI's one write rule (ruling ``balance:R-BAL359``, the ship marker; step X-cx's M2; and
``R-BAL386``, a task's done file), judged at the one gate every change into ``dev`` or
``main`` passes, since each takes a change only through its merge queue (``R-BAL322``).

**A card shipped when its marker ``plan/ships/N`` is on ``dev`` or ``main``**
(:func:`_git.shipped`), and a release counts the money changes it carries from the markers
it brings to ``main`` (``tools/release``).  So which change may write a marker decides
what every card's state and every release's count say.  Git cannot say which change may
write a path; this check is that one rule, judged once, where the change lands, and never
reconciled after.

**What is judged is the merge that lands.**  A merge-queue group runs on the merge commit
its target becomes, and a pull request's run on GitHub's trial merge of it
(``refs/pull/N/merge``): each a merge M whose first parent is the target's tip and whose
second the pull request's head (measured 2026-10-23 on every queue run so far, each of
one pull request; X-cx L8's ``m2_plan.md`` s.1).  So the change judged is ``M^1 -> M``
(:func:`_git.changes`): what the pull request lands, never what its branch merged from the
target.  Its number comes from the event, a queue group's from the group's branch
``gh-readonly-queue/<base>/pr-<N>-<sha>`` (:func:`named`); its base, head branch and head
commit from GitHub (:func:`pull_from_environment`, with the job's own token).  A merge
whose second parent is not that head -- a group of several pull requests might build one
(unmeasured) -- is not judged (exit 2), so the gate fails closed whatever GitHub builds.  A
pull request into a branch other than ``dev`` or ``main`` lands nothing on either: what it
carries is judged when that branch's own pull request lands it (exit 0, said).  A push to
``main`` was judged in ``main``'s queue, its only way in (exit 0, said).

**The rule, over each entry under ``plan/ships/`` the change writes (rules 1-7), and each
it leaves as it was (rule 8):**

1. **An entry that is no card's marker** is refused, as M's tree reads it by quill's one
   reading of a tree's markers (:func:`_git.lines_in`): a name that is no card number
   (:func:`_git.card_of`), a file in a directory below, ``plan/ships`` itself a file, or no
   file at all, a submodule's commit (a gitlink), which every reader of the markers names
   no card's.
2. **A delete passes, from any branch**: an undo, a revert of the card's merge or a
   person's "not done".  Rules 1 and 3-6 read only what a change adds or changes.
3. **A line the target branch's own line held once never comes back**, from any branch,
   the card's own included (:func:`_git.landings`, read at M's first parent).  A revert of
   the revert would re-ship the card with no change to its record, so a release would count
   none of the code it brings back (the ruling's report, finding 1).  A card undone ships
   again from a fresh claim, which writes a new line.
4. **A line the OTHER integration branch's own line took in passes only as carried from
   it**, from any branch, the card's own included -- a release, a resync, a branch that
   merged the other in: when the change BRINGS a commit of that line through which it took
   the line in (M holds it and M's first parent does not), and does not hold the commit of
   that line through which the branch later undid it (:func:`_git.landings`); that is, the
   merge that landed the card's code and marker together, judged where it landed.  A copy
   of the line, or a merge of the claim commit alone, brings no such commit, and would put
   the record where the code is not (measured 2026-10-23, ``m2_probe/f4.sh`` cases 7 and 8),
   as would a copy made after a release that brought the card's landing and its revert
   together; and a revert of the other branch's revert would re-ship the card with no
   change to its record, then refused by rule 3 at every release (M2's review, HIGH-1 and
   MEDIUM-3, measured).  A cherry-pick is a copy too: a picked marker is refused, and the
   line arrives through the merge that took it in.  The tracker is not read for a carried
   line: it was judged where it first landed, and the tracker has changed since
   (``R-BAL184``).
5. **Any other line only from ``card/N``**, card N's own claim (:func:`_git.claimed_card`), a
   branch of this repository: one of another repository is no claim.  And a change from
   ``card/N`` must add or change ``plan/ships/N``: a branch pushed again after its merge
   records nothing (the report's 5c).
6. **The records-only door** (``R-BAL363``): a change into ``main`` whose every entry, at
   any path, ADDS a card's marker may add one from any branch, for a card no commit of
   ``dev`` or ``main`` ever marked (:func:`_git.ever_marked`) and no claim was ever made for
   (:func:`_git.ever_claimed`): work that landed before records existed, vouched for by
   whoever writes the change.  A claimed card's work is the records' own, recorded by its
   claim.  It is deleted once the history cards (``R-BAL353``) are recorded.
7. **Every card rule 5 or 6 lets a change record is read against the tracker**
   (:func:`refusals`): a card the tracker holds; work (:func:`_state.no_work`, which names a
   container, a ruling, a question or a card with no type for ``quill sync`` too); and not
   still being filed (:func:`_state.filing_unfinished`) nor dropped while it was
   (:func:`_state.filing_ended`; ``R-BAL202``), on which the release tool's card reader
   rests (``tools/release/_cards.py``).  Whether a step is split reads which of its leaves
   git says shipped once M and the other branch meet (the merge of the two, AFTER below),
   as ``quill sync`` reads it once they have.
8. **No marker the change leaves as M's first parent holds it may change what ``dev`` and
   ``main`` together say of its card** (``R-BAL385``, widened by ``R-BAL390``), which rules
   1-7, reading what a change writes, never see.  A resync built by hand writes nothing on
   ``dev``'s line, yet one that keeps the marker a hotfix on ``main`` deleted would make the
   card read shipped again with no change to its record, and the next release would count
   none of its code (X-cx L8's resync probe, measured 2026-10-23); one that drops the
   marker of a hotfix ``main`` holds, keeping its code, would make the card read not
   shipped while its code runs; and one that keeps ``dev``'s line where ``main`` undid it
   and shipped the card again on a new one would leave the next release refused by rule 3
   (L1's review, measured).  So what BEFORE (the merge of M's first parent with the other
   branch) says of each card -- not shipped, shipped on a line, or a conflict -- is
   compared with what AFTER (the merge of M with it) says, each git's one merge that says
   what shipped (:func:`_git.merge`), and a card they answer differently, at a marker M
   leaves, is refused (:func:`_unwritten`), **unless the change shows the delete**
   (``R-BAL391``): where M holds no marker and AFTER settles none, a card BEFORE says
   shipped on a line passes when a commit the change brings -- M's, and neither its first
   parent's nor the other branch's -- deletes that very line in a change of its own, no
   merge (:func:`_shown`), as a delete on the target's own line passes by rule 2: a revert
   made in a branch that merged the other in, or a person's "not done".  A merge's
   resolution shows no delete, whichever its first parent, so a marker one drops is refused
   where no such commit deletes that very line, and so is a delete of an older line.  **A
   known hole** (R-BAL391's review, its M1; left open when the developer rescinded
   ``R-BAL393``, for step ``balance:X-ex``): the pass asks whether such a commit ever
   deleted that very line, never whether its delete stands at M, so a merge whose result is
   edited by hand to drop a marker, which git's own merge of its two parents keeps, lands
   where the branch deleted that line before and took it back (a revert, then a revert of
   that revert), or wrote a copy of it and deleted the copy; the card then reads not shipped
   while its code runs (measured 2026-10-23).  At such a marker the two merges differ only
   when their merge bases do, and those differ only when M brings a commit of the other
   branch its first parent lacks -- a resync, a release, a branch that merged the other in
   -- so a change bringing none can never trip it.  A marker that conflicts BEFORE is
   settled by the change: it passes, whatever AFTER settles it as -- ``dev`` re-shipped the
   card from a fresh claim while ``main`` deleted its old line, and a resync keeps
   ``dev``'s, the ruling's own pass case, a line judged where it landed -- unless the line
   AFTER holds is one the other branch's own line held once and undid, which rule 4
   refuses where a change writes it.  One that conflicts AFTER and not BEFORE refuses to
   judge; one that conflicts in both is passed over, so an app change lands in a week the
   two disagree.

**A task's done file ``plan/tasks/T`` is judged by the same rules** (``R-BAL386``): a
task is a piece of one card, a commit inside its one pull request, done when its file is in
the merge of ``dev`` and ``main`` (``_git.shipped``) or in its card's live claim.  Rules 1-4
and 8 read each entry under ``plan/tasks/`` as they read a marker, in a task's words, in the
same walk of git's history: an entry that is no task's done file is refused, a delete passes,
a line the target held once never comes back (a task undone is done again from a fresh done
file, ``quill task-file``, never a revert of its revert), and a line of the other branch
comes only through the merge that took it in.  Rule 5 lets only a claim write one, and rule
7 then reads the task: written on ``card/N``, it must be a task under N, as ``quill sync``
reads a claim's done file (:func:`_state.names_no_task`), so the file of a task since moved
under another card is refused on N's branch.  Rule 6 is the markers' alone: a task's file
makes a change no records-only one.  And **a change from ``card/N`` recording card N is
refused while a task under N that was not dropped lacks its done file in M** (:func:`_owed`):
a task the TOOL closed counts, as its close only shows git; a person's close, or ``quill
drop``'s, is a drop.  The release tool never reads a task.

**The tracker is read only when a card or a task must be**, through the card-only reader
(:class:`_tracker.CardReader`) and the token :data:`TOKEN_VARIABLE` holds: never quill's
App, never the board.  In CI that token is an installation token of the read-only App
"Shekel plan reader" (Issues read-only, installed on the tracker only; ``R-BAL289``,
``R-BAL311``), minted by ``ci.yml``'s ``landing`` job for this run alone and revoked when
the job ends (GitHub expires one within the hour in any case).  The App's private key never
reaches this module, but it is in the runner's memory for the whole job, so the design
narrows what a leak from this job yields and does not close it.  A run that is handed no
key mints no token (GitHub documents that a Dependabot run and a fork's pull request get no
Actions secrets), so there a change that needs a card read refuses to judge, and one that
needs none is judged without a read.

**What cannot be read refuses to judge** (exit 2): a command line naming no pull request;
the pull request, when no token or repository is set, GitHub answers an error or cannot be
reached, or its answer lacks a field; a merge that is not the pull request's; git; a marker
or task's done file the change leaves that conflicts AFTER and not BEFORE (rule 8); when a
card or task must be read, a marker that conflicts AFTER; and the tracker, as
:func:`refusals` says.

Usage, at the repository root::

    python -m tools.quill.landing <event> <merge-sha> <pull>

``<event>`` is the workflow's event name, ``<merge-sha>`` the commit it checked out, and
``<pull>`` a pull request's number or a queue group's branch.  Exit status: 0 nothing
refused; 1 refused, each reason printed; 2 nothing judged, saying why.

"""Tasks in quill (ruling ``balance:R-BAL386``): a piece of one step or finding, a commit
inside its card's one pull request, done when its file ``plan/tasks/N`` is in git
(``_state.done_tasks``).

``quill file task`` files one (``_filing``).  Here are ``quill task-file``, which writes a
task's file into the working tree for the session to commit with the piece it finishes
(:func:`cmd_task_file`), and the read a card's drop makes of the tasks under it
(:func:`taken_by_drop`).  ``quill sync`` writes each task's state from git, and ``quill
show`` names each task under a card with it.

Split out of the command module, which these would take past the 1,000 lines
``too-many-lines`` allows.

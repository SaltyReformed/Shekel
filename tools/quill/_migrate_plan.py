"""X-cx's migration, its PLAN: the writes still to make, from what the tracker holds, to file
the cards the registries make (the L7 design's draft 4 s.4).

**GitHub is the only state.**  Every run reads the whole tracker -- every card with its body
and comments, its milestones, its board -- and this module says, from that and the items
(:mod:`_migrate_source`), what is still to write and what it refuses.  So a run cut short
anywhere is resumed by running it again, and a run with nothing left writes nothing.  It is
PURE: it reads only what it is handed (:class:`Tracked`), and writes nothing; X-cx's B2b
executes what it says.

**A card's KEY is its arc label and its alias** (:func:`card_key`): the old id its title
carries in brackets (:func:`check.title_alias`), under its one arc label -- except a card
filed already (:data:`_migrate_source.MAPPED`), keyed by its number.  An item's card is the
card of its key; a card whose key is no item's is the tracker's own, and moves nowhere.

**The writes, in order** (draft 4 s.4, s.11 V3-8, ruling ``balance:R-BAL242``):

- HISTORY, first, inside the cutover's freeze: each ruling filed born marked, then closed
  with its mark removed in ONE write (:data:`CLOSE_UNMARKED`);
- the FREEZE: each outcome's milestone, found by its TITLE (R-BAL243); then the steps in
  an order that files a card's parent and its blockers before it; then the findings, each
  blocked by its owner step (R-BAL395); then the questions.  A card's writes are its
  create (born marked, its labels and milestone in it), its parent link, a link per open
  blocker, a question's As filed comment, its board place (a ranked step's or a
  question's), and last its mark's removal -- a container's only after every step's
  writes, so after its last leaf is linked (draft 4 s.4, R9).  A card filed already takes
  its links alone.

**The board** is put in its desired order apart, once every card is on it
(:func:`desired_board`, :func:`moves`): the ranked steps by rank, the card filed already
at its rank holding every board card below it in its present order, then the questions in
the ledger's order (R-BAL238); only the cards outside the longest common subsequence of the
present and desired orders move, so a second run moves nothing.  What the board's shape
refuses is refused by :func:`plan` itself, before any write (:func:`board_refusals`).

**What it refuses, never chooses** (each a line of :attr:`Plan.refusals`): a key on two
cards (a create re-sent after a rate-limit refusal it was performed for; a card given the
key by hand, retitled or relabelled, one of the tracker's own or another item's, and the
key a card filed already's among them; or a re-sent create's card edited by hand), each
card named with what it holds; only in the state a re-sent create leaves, its last card
refused nothing as the item's card on the read once its refusals are settled as they say,
assuming nothing a person decides (:func:`_shared_refusals`: each key on two cards holding
the card that keeps it, a card filed already's own or a re-sent create's last, any other
none, and no card or milestone excused), are the others offered for deletion, and that
last card, the one the run went on with, named to keep by its number (GitHub's numbers
rise), and a card filed already is never offered (:func:`_shared`); a card filed already
that the tracker does not hold, or that still carries the filing mark (its own filing is
unfinished); a card no item claims but the tracker's own (:func:`_unclaimed`); a step the
registries put below a card filed already (X-cx's leaves are its sub-issues, never
``steps.md`` rows); a milestone the input file does not name (one renamed on the web would
be made again); a board card the desired order has no place for (:func:`board_refusals`);
an item's card of another kind, labels or milestone, or one whose outcome's milestone the
tracker no longer holds (deleted or renamed on the web, it would be made again holding none
of its cards), closed when it moves open, or open when it is a ruling; one whose filing ENDED
(:func:`_state.filing_ended`: dropped, or a ruling withdrawn, R-BAL205's hazard); one under
another parent, blocked by a card its item is not, or linked outside the tracker (a
person's call); one whose title, body or As filed comment is not what the registries make
it at this commit (:func:`_migrate_bodies.differences`; a stale card is never finished, and
``quill edit`` cannot repair a ruling, R-BAL220); one whose filing finished with a write
still missing; a title whose alias does not read back as its item's; and steps waiting in a
cycle.  Each is stated once: a card or item already refused is not refused again for what
follows from it.  **A plan that refuses anything writes nothing** (:func:`plan`): one
refusal leaves other items' writes leaning on it -- a container unmarked over a leaf that
was refused, a finding blocked by a step with no card -- so every refusal is settled
before any write.
The registries' and the input file's own refusals (:func:`_migrate_source.read_source`,
:func:`_migrate_input.grade`, :func:`_migrate_bodies.build` and its census,
:func:`_migrate_numbers.link`) are the executor's to gate on: it runs no plan while any of
them refuses.

**A card filed already** (:data:`_migrate_source.MAPPED`, card #1) is graded on its kind,
labels and links -- parent, blockers and links outside the tracker -- and on its state
(open, its filing not ended); its title, text and milestone are its own, never the
registries'.  That is draft 4 s.5's "key, kind, labels and links", and the state besides:
no link is written onto a card in a state the migration does not expect.

**What the tracker may hold besides the items' cards** (:func:`_unclaimed`): the cards
filed already, and the TRACKER'S OWN cards below them -- X-cx's own, of any kind (#2-#10,
#26 and #27 under #1, all steps, measured read-only 2026-10-09 and again 2026-10-24; a
finding or a ruling ``quill file`` files with #1 or a card below it as its owner, blocked
by it and below nothing, R-BAL395, is its own too, :func:`_own`) -- and nothing else, so
the cutover starts on a tracker holding X-cx's cards and the migration's only.  A card no
item claims is told the tracker's own by its NUMBER, which no hand edit changes, never by
what its title, labels, body or comments still say: the migration makes every write
inside the freeze (R-BAL242), and no card is filed natively inside it (draft 4 s.4), so
every card numbered above the migration's first card is the migration's.  Its first card
is the lowest-numbered card an
item's key names (a card filed already apart), which rests on two PREMISES: no card the
tracker held before the migration carries an item's key (an X-cx leaf's ``[X-cx Ln]``
alias is no registry id), and the freeze holds from the migration's first create to its
last run, gaps between runs included.  Broken, each fails closed: a card of the tracker's
own retitled to an item's key is refused as that item's card, and the tracker's own cards
numbered above it are refused as the migration's too, each refusal naming that card as
the one to settle FIRST (it leads, because it cannot tell the two cases apart); a card filed
natively between runs is refused as the migration's.  Refused: a card no item claims
numbered above the first card, wherever it sits and whatever it holds -- the migration's
card with its title or arc label changed by hand, or one whose item left the registries
(or a card filed natively inside the freeze); and one numbered below it outside every card
filed already (filed outside X-cx before the migration, an X-cx leaf quill unlinked when it
was dropped while marked, R-BAL205, or that a person unlinked by hand, or one of the
migration's first cards with its key changed by hand or its item gone from the registries,
which numbers the first card above it).
**Where the freeze ends in code** (the second premise's bound): at L8's deleting pull
request, which removes the registries, the read-only door :mod:`_migrate_source` imports
(``tools/plan_gate/registries.py``, R-BAL244) and the migration's own modules, so nothing
is left to call :func:`plan` once natively filed cards are allowed again.  A run between
``migrate verify`` and that merge is inside the freeze still, and refuses every card filed
natively (fail closed).
What this cannot see: a card of the migration's numbered lower than every card that still
carries an item's key (a card filed already apart), sitting below a card filed already (or,
a finding, owned by one or by a card below one: :func:`_own`), where it reads as the
tracker's own.  That takes every card the migration filed before it
to have lost its key, been deleted by hand or lost its item from the registries; the first
cards it files are closed rulings (HISTORY runs first, R-BAL242, once the executor runs it
first), so it is a person rekeying or deleting the first rulings filed, or their rows
leaving the registries, and one of them moved below card #1, inside the freeze that forbids
each of those edits.

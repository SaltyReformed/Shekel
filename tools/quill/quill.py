"""The ``quill`` command: how every session reads and writes Shekel's plan in its private tracker.

The plan lives in the private repository ``saltyreformed-labs/shekel-plan``
(ruling ``balance:R-BAL170``): each step, finding, ruling and question is one
issue, a "card", and one board holds the steps and questions in the order the
developer drags them (``R-BAL177``).  Every write goes through quill's
GitHub App, and every card a session files passes :mod:`check` first.

Whether a card SHIPPED is git's answer, never the card's state: its ship
marker ``plan/ships/N`` in the merge of ``dev`` and ``main`` (ruling
``balance:R-BAL359``, :mod:`_git`).  The card's open or closed state is
display, which ``sync`` writes from git.  A card is CLAIMED while the code
repository's ``origin`` holds a branch ``card/N`` whose work neither ``dev``
nor ``main`` holds: ``claim`` makes it, a commit adding the card's marker
pushed create-only, and ``release`` keeps its work on ``released/N/<instant>``
and deletes it.  So every command that asks git -- ``next``, ``show``,
``claim``, ``release``, ``move``, ``drop``, ``sync``, and ``file`` given an
owner or a parent or finding a card of its own closed while still marked --
first reads it once (:func:`_git.read`): it lists the ``card/N`` branches
``origin`` holds, then fetches ``dev``, ``main`` and each of them, which moves
this checkout's ``origin/dev``, ``origin/main`` and ``origin/card/N``.
(``move`` and ``drop`` ask it whether a step is split: a leaf dropped before
its filing finished is no leaf unless git says it shipped, ``_state.leaves``.)
A TASK (ruling ``balance:R-BAL386``) is a piece of one step or finding, a sub-issue
of it done when its file ``plan/tasks/N`` is in git (``_state.done_tasks``):
``file task`` files one, ``task-file`` writes its file for the commit that finishes
the piece (:mod:`_tasks`), and ``sync``, ``drop`` and ``show`` read it.

Usage, from the repository root (``plan#N`` or ``N`` names a card)::

    python -m tools.quill.quill next [--arc ARC]
    python -m tools.quill.quill claim plan#N [--here]
    python -m tools.quill.quill release plan#N
    python -m tools.quill.quill show plan#N | OLD-ID

                                (--question-file Q | --from-question plan#Q) --answer-file A
    python -m tools.quill.quill file question --arc ARC --title NAME --body-file QUESTION
    python -m tools.quill.quill file task --parent plan#N --title NAME --body-file PIECE
    python -m tools.quill.quill task-file plan#T
    python -m tools.quill.quill edit plan#N [--title NAME] [--body-file TEXT]
    python -m tools.quill.quill comment plan#N --body-file TEXT
    python -m tools.quill.quill block plan#N --by plan#M [--remove]
    python -m tools.quill.quill move plan#N (--top | --bottom | --after plan#M)
    python -m tools.quill.quill drop plan#N --why REASON
    python -m tools.quill.quill sync [--dry-run]
    python -m tools.quill.quill spec-history plan#N [--since BRANCH_OR_DATE]
    python -m tools.quill.quill spec-revert plan#N --to EDIT_ID
    python -m tools.quill.quill export --to DIR

Exit status: 0 done; 1 refused, with nothing written (or, for ``sync``, a
REPORT a person must act on); 2 a call failed -- GitHub, git, the network, or
a file the command reads or writes (the App's credentials, a ``--body-file``,
``export``'s file) -- or the command line itself is not one of the forms above
(argparse's usage error), before anything is read.  Every write is printed as it
lands, so after a failure the output says what was written; ``file`` run again finishes a filing
a failure cut short (R-BAL186): every card it creates is marked ``filing``
until its last write, and a marked card is never offered (R-BAL202).  Run
again, it writes nothing over a card the earlier run filed that is still open,
still marked (refused when a person's or `quill drop`'s close ended it, unless it
is work git says shipped), or -- for a ruling, which its own filing closes -- blocked by
its owner (R-BAL395); a card closed after its filing finished is not looked for, so the
command files another (unless a listing that lags its close still shows it open).
``edit`` run again writes only the parts that differ, so it finishes an edit a
failure cut short.

    undone the same way.  A card's drop drops each task under it still to do first
    (:func:`_drop`, R-BAL190's shape: the tool records the decision where the work is).
    A leaf dropped while its filing has not finished is first taken out of the
    split it began, which it was never part of (R-BAL205, :func:`_leave_split`):
    unlinked, and its split step, if it was the only leaf and will be open, a
    plain step again, on the board (in the leaf's place when the leaf is on
    it).  A split step the TOOL closed is first shown as ``sync`` would show it
    once the drop is done (:func:`_state.drop_shows`, review C2 LOW 6): reopened
    while it still has work to do, closed again as its other leaves say, or, a
    plain step a drop closed, left dropped.  One a PERSON closed keeps their
    close, and stays off the board.
    No drop leaves a link that is no leaf behind it (:func:`_state.drop_unlinks`):
    a step closed while still being filed and linked under the card dropped is
    unlinked before the card is closed, and so is every leaf still being filed
    that a split step's drop closes, after its close and before any step left
    bare is closed.  Left linked until the next ``sync`` (which reads every
    marked card), such a leaf would act on the plan as it stands meanwhile: a
    person reopening it would make it a leaf again and revive the step that was
    dropped (review C2 M1), and a person removing its stale mark would make it a
    dropped leaf, so R-BAL187 could drop a step nobody built (review C3 M1).
    A split step holds no decision of the tool's (R-BAL190):
    dropping one notes it on the split step first, then drops every leaf below
    it that is still work by git's answer -- not shipped and not dropped,
    whatever its card shows -- each with the reason, and names the shipped ones
    it leaves; its own state shows its leaves at the next ``sync``.  A step
    every leaf of which was still being filed is closed too, after them: closed
    while marked, they were never its leaves (:func:`_state.left_bare`).  Run again
    after a failure, it notes the split step again and drops the leaves still
    work (a leaf whose comment landed but not its close gets the reason twice).

"""The tracker's cards and board order, read and written by quill.

Every card write goes through quill's GitHub App (ruling
``balance:R-BAL170``), a separate identity from the developer's login, so a
reader can tell the tool's write from his own edit and never act on his.  This
module is the only place quill speaks to the tracker -- the daily backup
(:mod:`_export`) keeps GitHub's own answers to the reads here, each built on the one
walk of a connection, :func:`_github.paged` -- and it decides nothing about the plan
(``_state`` does), it only reads and writes.

**No claim is the tracker's**: since the ship marker (ruling ``balance:R-BAL359``) a
claim is the code repository's branch ``card/N``, read and written by ``_git``.

**What each read can see, measured on the tracker 2026-10-04:**

- A card's REST id (what the sub-issue and blocked-by calls take) is its
  GraphQL ``fullDatabaseId``.
- The board's order is ``items(orderBy: {field: POSITION})``, and it LAGS a
  write (L1 measured 7 of 9 just-added cards listed, all 9 about 20 seconds
  later), so a write that places a card reads the board back until it shows
  the card where it was put (:data:`BOARD_WAIT_SECONDS`).
- GitHub silently drops an issue's ``type`` when the writer lacks push access,
  so every write that sets one reads it back.
- The listings of open cards and of marked cards (the :data:`setup_tracker.FILING`
  label), and a card's sub-issues read by its number or in a listing, each
  showed a create, a mark's removal or an unlink at the first read of it after
  the write (2026-10-04 22:13, one sample each, on a quiet tracker; the delay
  itself was not timed).  Nothing here waits for them, as it does for the board;
  one sample does not show they never lag.  Removing a mark a card does not
  carry is answered 404 "Label does not exist".

**Every read and write names its tracker's :class:`setup_tracker.Place`**, the one
the :class:`Board` was resolved for: :data:`setup_tracker.PLAN` for every quill
command, and the rehearsal tracker for X-cx's migration (L7).  A write cannot
reach another tracker's cards or board:

- the App's token is minted NARROWED to the place's one repository
  (:meth:`Tracker.connect`).  That narrows repository access only: the board is an
  ORGANIZATION project, which the token may still reach by node id;
- so the board is resolved by its title in the place's organization and refused
  unless it is linked to the place's repository (:func:`board_of`), and every board
  write is sent through :meth:`Board._write`, which names that board and no other.

**The numbering** (:func:`numbering`): GitHub numbers issues and pull requests in one
sequence and answers a DELETED issue's number ``410 Gone`` (#11-#25 and #28-#30 on
the real tracker), so a listing of the cards that exist shows gaps.  Each gap is
read by number, which is how X-cx's migration (L7, Code B) is to find a card whose
create answer was lost rather than file it twice.

**A link to an issue outside the tracker is carried, never followed**
(ruling ``balance:R-BAL188``).  GitHub lets a parent, sub-issue or blocked-by
link cross repositories in one organization (Shekel itself joins it at X-cx's
L5); read by number alone, such a link would name the tracker's card of that
number instead.  So every link and every board item is asked which repository
it names (:func:`_is_tracker_issue`, the one test), and a card keeps its
outside links apart (:attr:`Card.outside`) for the plan to report.

**A card can be read without the board** (:class:`CardReader`), by a token that may read
the tracker's issues and nothing else (built for CI's landing check, X-cx L9d).  Such a
card is a :class:`BareCard`, which has no board item at all, so a decision about the board
handed one raises instead of reading it as a card off the board; :class:`Tracker` is the
reader that reads each card with its board item, a :class:`Card`.

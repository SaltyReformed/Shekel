"""CI's landing check over a task's done file (ruling ``balance:R-BAL386``): the one write rule
the ship markers are judged by, over ``plan/tasks/`` too, and the one arm it adds, a card's
pull request refused while a task under it that was not dropped lacks its done file.

A task is a piece of one card, a commit inside its one pull request, done when its file
``plan/tasks/T`` is in the merge of dev and main.  The picked text's three rules: only that
card's branch writes a file for a task under it; the card's pull request is refused while an
open task lacks its file; an entry under ``plan/tasks/`` that is no task's file is refused.
Graded hardest, as the plan asks (``plan-tracker-2026-10-23/r385_r386_s3_plan.md``, T2), on a
release and a resync carrying task files, and on a task re-parented.  Every history is built
and judged, and every tracker answered, by the builders the landing tests share
(:mod:`tools.quill._histories`).

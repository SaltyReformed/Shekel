"""The tracker tool's git reading of a task's done file (ruling ``balance:R-BAL386``), from
throwaway repositories under pytest's tmp_path.

A task is done when its file ``plan/tasks/T`` is in the merge of ``dev`` and ``main``, or in
the tip of its card's live claim when the claim's own commits wrote it, read as a marker is
read (:func:`_git.lines_in`).  Which card a task is under only the tracker says, so git's answer
for a claim names every task file its own commits wrote; ``quill sync`` keeps those of tasks
under that claim's card.  The tracking refs are
pointed directly (:func:`scratch.point_dev`, :func:`scratch.point_main`), as the readers here
take them as they are and fetch nothing.

"""X-cx's migration, its SOURCE: the plan's registries read as the cards they become.

X-cx's piece L7 moves the plan in ``docs/plans/`` into the tracker: every open step,
every finding, every question and every ruling becomes one card (ruling
``balance:R-BAL170``; the design of record is the L7 design's draft 4).  This module
reads the registries and says what each card is -- its kind, its key, its parent and
blockers, its labels, its outcome, its place on the board -- and where each step's
spec and each steps-section paragraph lies.  It decides nothing the developer's input
file decides (:mod:`_migrate_input`: names, rewritten questions, what each paragraph
is), and it writes no card text (:mod:`_migrate_bodies`).  It is pure: it reads
nothing but the :class:`Registries` it is handed, which :func:`read_registries` fills
from git, as one commit holds them (rulings ``balance:R-BAL257``, ``R-BAL259``).

**One producer per fact (CLAUDE.md rule 14).**  The rows are the plan gate's own
readers, through its read-only door (``tools/plan_gate/registries.py``, ruling
``R-BAL244``); a step's entry, the checkbox grammar and the fence rule are
:mod:`tools.ci.arc_steps`'; the arcs and their steps headings are :mod:`tools.ci.arcs`'.
Nothing here parses a registry table or an arc document's grammar a second time.

**What moves** (draft 4 s.1): every step not SHIPPED (R-BAL236: a shipped step moves
nowhere, so neither does an edge to one); every ``ledger.md`` row, as a FINDING under
the first step its owner cell names (R-BAL239) or, naming none, as a QUESTION; and
every ``rulings.md`` row as a closed ruling with no parent (R-BAL236).  A card's KEY is
its arc and its ALIAS, the old id its title carries in brackets (``[X-bk-2] ...``).
One open step is a card already (:data:`MAPPED`), so nothing is filed for it.

**What it refuses, never chooses** (each a line of :attr:`Source.refusals`): an arc
document whose steps heading starts no line or more than one; an open step in an
identity class of more than one row; one whose steps section holds a checkbox count
other than one; one whose order cell and sentence disagree on whether it is a
container; one open with no rank that is no container; a checkbox outside every steps
section, or for no step of its arc; a blocker naming no step, or itself; an outcome's
scope naming no step, a step in two scopes, and two outcomes sharing a name; an owner
cell outside the owner grammar; a finding whose FIRST step owner does not move; a
question whose owner states no note; a key two items share; a :data:`MAPPED` key naming
no open step; a step under two containers neither of which splits the other; an open
container with no open step under it; two paragraphs the input file would name by one
first line; and GitHub's own caps, which it would refuse mid-run (:data:`SUB_ISSUE_CAP`,
:data:`NESTING_CAP`).

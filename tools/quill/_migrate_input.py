"""X-cx's migration, its INPUT FILE: the text a session wrote and the developer approved.

No registry row has what some cards need, so a session writes it into one JSON file
and a fresh reviewer grades it before anything is filed (rulings ``balance:R-BAL237``,
``R-BAL241``, ``R-BAL243``, ``R-BAL245``; the L7 design's draft 4 s.2 and s.11).  The
file lives OUTSIDE the repository: its text may quote a real figure, which the private
tracker allows (``R-BAL172``) and this public repository does not (``R-BAL132``).

Six maps, each GRADED BOTH WAYS against what the registries hold (:func:`grade`): an
entry the registries need and the file lacks is refused, and so is one the file holds
that names nothing the registries need.  Every entry records the hash of the text it
was written from (:func:`_migrate_source.source_hash`, draft 4 s.11 V3-3), so an entry
whose source changed since is refused until it is written and reviewed again.

- ``names``: ``{"arc:alias": {"name", "source"}}``, every card's short name (R-BAL237);
  its title is ``[alias] name`` (:func:`check.card_title`), and its length is
  :func:`check.violations`' to grade, on the built card.  A card already filed
  (:data:`_migrate_source.MAPPED`) keeps its title and takes no name.
- ``questions``: ``{"arc:alias": {"question", "source"}}``, a question written for a
  question card whose note holds none (R-BAL241: PC-501, REC-531 and N-345 then);
- ``notes_kept``: ``{"arc:alias": {"source"}}``, a note with no ``?`` judged to be the
  question as it stands (V3-9).  Every note with no ``?`` is in exactly one of the two;
  a note that holds one moves word for word and is in neither.
- ``notes``: ``[{"arc", "step", "first_line", "disposition", "source"}]``, each paragraph
  of an open step's entry starting at or left of its checkbox (V3-2): the step's
  ``own`` text, kept on its card, or a ``note`` about other steps, which moves nowhere.
- ``preambles``: ``[{"arc", "first_line", "disposition", "source", ...}]``, each prose
  paragraph of a steps section outside every entry (R-BAL245), by where it goes after
  the cutover: ``dropped`` (its other ``home`` named), a ``rule`` (its ``home``,
  ``CLAUDE.md`` or a ``.claude/rules`` file, written by L8's PR), ``blocked-by`` (an
  edge ``steps.md`` already holds: the coordinator's registry edit, never the
  migration's, draft 4 s.12), ``card-body`` (appended to one open ``step``'s card, the
  only disposition the migration writes), or ``reasoning`` (L8's keep-or-drop list).
- ``milestones``: ``{"outcome": {"title", "description", "source"}}``, each OUTCOMES row's
  milestone (R-BAL243), titled with no number: the order among outcomes is the board's.

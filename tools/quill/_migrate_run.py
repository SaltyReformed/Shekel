"""X-cx's migration, its RUN: the plan's writes made on a tracker, as quill's App (the L7
design's draft 4 s.4).

:mod:`_migrate_plan` says what is still to write; this makes it, write by write, on the
tracker the run is aimed at (``migrate history|open --target plan|rehearsal``, with no
default).  Nothing here decides what a card says or where it goes.

**Every run starts by reading the whole tracker** (:meth:`Run.read`): every card whole,
the numbering probe (:func:`_tracker.numbering`: a card the listing lacks stops the run,
so a create whose answer was lost is found, never made again), the milestones and the
board.  Then the plan, handed EVERY item, rulings included, in both phases; a plan that
refuses anything writes nothing.

**The two obligations the plan's number rule rests on** (:mod:`_migrate_plan`'s
docstring, "What this cannot see"): HISTORY's writes are made before any of the
freeze's -- :meth:`Run.open` refuses while the plan holds any -- so the migration's
first cards are rulings; and :func:`_migrate_plan.plan` is handed every item, so no
item's card reads as no item's.

**A write is addressed by KEY** (:class:`_migrate_plan.Write`) and takes its card's
number from the run's read or from the create that answered in this run.  A run STOPS at
the first write GitHub refuses or does not answer (the tracker's own error), or that the
run finds it may not make (:class:`Stopped`), and makes nothing after it: what it made
stands, and running the same command again resumes it, its read finding a write that
landed with its answer lost.

**A by-number re-read precedes each write a listing that lags the run before would
send again** (draft 4 s.4), and the write is not sent when the re-read shows it made: a
parent link and a blocked-by link (both cards), a question's As filed comment (its
comments), a board add and a mark's removal (the card).  A card found under another
parent, in the tracker or outside it, stops its parent link at the re-read, and a card gone
stops any write that re-reads it (the comment's through GitHub's NOT_FOUND error,
:meth:`_tracker.Tracker.comments`: reasoned, unmeasured); any other edit since the read is
left to the next plan, which refuses what it grades: the board phase's re-plan, after the
writes, or the next run's.  The rest take none: a create the listing lags is found by the
numbering probe; a milestone the listing lags is sent again, and fails closed, refused by
GitHub (reasoned, unmeasured: the rehearsal's to measure) or by the next read's refusal of
two of one title; and a ruling's close with its mark removed, sent again, leaves it as it
was.

**Paced, renewed.**  Each write after a run's first is made at least :data:`PACE_SECONDS`
after the run's last, GitHub's documented 500 content-creating requests an hour with every
write counted until the rehearsal measures which count (draft 4 s.4; a run started right
after another stopped is not paced against it); its rate-limit refusals are still waited
out by :class:`_github.GitHub`.  The App's installation token lives an hour, so the run
connects afresh :data:`RENEW_SECONDS` after its last connect, before the next read or
write.  One call that runs past the token's life -- a request's rate-limit waits may
take up to an hour (:data:`_github.RATE_LIMIT_BUDGET_SECONDS`) -- is answered 401, and
the run stops; the next run connects afresh.

**The board** is ordered once every card's writes are made (:meth:`Run.open`): the
tracker is read and planned again, and anything still to write or refused stops the run
(a read that lags the run's own writes, a create GitHub performed twice, or a person's
edit; run ``migrate open`` again once GitHub's reads catch up, and settle what it still
refuses as each says, else by hand); then the board is read until it holds every card the
desired order places on that read of the tracker, for :data:`_tracker.BOARD_WAIT_SECONDS` at
most, else the run stops, so a board read that lags one of them is waited on, never ordered
without it.  From that one
board read come the order of the cards below a card filed already, the moves and the
board items' ids, and a card it holds beyond them stops the run; only the cards outside
the longest common subsequence move (:func:`_migrate_plan.moves`), each a write, each read
back until the board shows it; and last the board is read once more, and an order other
than the desired one stops the run.

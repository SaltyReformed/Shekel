"""The tracker tool's own questions of the code repository's git, and its writes there: a
card's claim and its release.

**Whether a card shipped is a TREE's answer** (ruling ``balance:R-BAL359``, the ship
marker, replacing the ``Ships:`` and ``Reopens:`` trailers for quill).  Card N shipped when
the file ``plan/ships/N`` (:func:`marker`) is in the tree of the merge of ``dev`` and
``main`` (:func:`shipped`): a hotfix on ``main`` counts before ``main`` is merged back into
``dev``, and a revert on ``dev`` counts before the release.  A marker's one line is the
instant its card was claimed, so every claim writes different content.  Which change may add
or change a marker is CI's one write rule, judged once where every change lands
(``tools/quill/landing.py``, step X-cx's M2): the card's own branch, or a release or resync
bringing the very commit through which the other branch took that marker in, and not the
one through which it undid it (:func:`landings`).  Every reader here takes the markers
``dev`` and ``main`` hold as they
are.  This module writes a marker only in :func:`claim`'s commit.

**A task is done when its file ``plan/tasks/T`` is in that tree too** (ruling
``balance:R-BAL386``; :func:`task_file`): a piece of one step or finding, a commit inside its
card's one pull request, whose file that commit writes.  Before the card lands it is done in
the tip of the card's live claim when the claim's own commits wrote that file
(:attr:`Claim.tasks`, :func:`own_tasks`: ``quill claim`` cuts a claim from ``dev`` unless told
otherwise, so its tip holds every task file ``dev`` does, and none of those is its own),
where only the tracker says which card a task is under, so ``quill sync`` keeps a claim's
task file only for a task under that claim's card.  A task file is read as a marker is
(:func:`lines_in`), and a revert of the commit that wrote it deletes it, so the task is no
longer done.

**A claim is the branch ``card/N`` on ``origin``** (:func:`card_branch`) whose tip neither
``dev`` nor ``main`` holds (:func:`claims`).  ``quill claim`` makes it (:func:`claim`): a
commit adding the card's marker, pushed CREATE-ONLY with a lease on the branch's absence, so
exactly one session wins -- a second claim stacked on the first, a fast-forward a plain push
would take, is refused ``stale info`` (measured on GitHub itself 2026-10-22, X-cx L8's
``m1_lease_probe``).  ``quill release`` moves the work to ``released/N/<instant>`` and then
deletes ``card/N`` with a lease on the tip it read (:func:`release`), so neither abandoned
work nor a newer push is ever lost.

**What a command reads** is :func:`read`, once: the claim branches as ``origin`` lists them
(never this clone's ``origin/card/*``, which a deleted branch leaves behind), then ONE fetch
of ``dev``, ``main`` and each of them, each by its name into its tracking ref
(:func:`fetch`), then the record and the claims from what that fetch brought.

Every call starts git through :mod:`tools.ci.gitcmd`, so ``root`` alone decides which
repository is read or written.  Nothing here writes the repository but :func:`fetch`'s
tracking refs, :func:`claim`'s objects, push and local branch, and :func:`release`'s two
pushes.

    the release tool reads it over a release's range (``<base>..<cut>``) for the commits

    reads its commits of one parent over what a change brings, for a delete shown in
    history (``tools/quill/landing.py``, rule 8, ``R-BAL391``).

    **It lists a commit for every marker any commit of that history ever held, and for every
    blob one held.**  Such a marker (or blob) arrived through a commit holding it whose
    parents do not: a
    commit of one parent, which ``--full-history`` lists wherever it sits -- git's default
    walk follows a merge through one parent alone when the merge matches it on the path, and
    so lost a ship and its revert on the side it pruned (M1's review H1: three histories,
    measured) -- or a merge none of whose parents holds it, whose change against its FIRST
    parent (``--diff-merges=first-parent``) lists it, as it lists every marker a merge
    brought into ``dev`` or ``main``.  Measured 2026-10-22 (git 2.56) on seven histories,
    one a marker a merge's resolution alone added and another's alone deleted, which
    ``--full-history`` without the merge's change missed.  (Git 2.56 also walked all seven
    fully with the merge's change and no ``--full-history``; nothing in git's manual says
    the one implies the other, so the walk states the flag its argument rests on.)  A blob
    is the same argument over a path's content: the first commit holding it at that path
    whose first parent does not lists it as the blob after its change.  On one line alone
    (``--first-parent``) every state is its first parent's plus that commit's change against
    it, so the walk lists every commit of the line through which the line took a marker or
    blob in.  With ``no_merges`` the walk keeps no such promise, by design: a marker a
    merge's resolution alone added or deleted is not listed, since no commit shows that
    change on its own.  Read with no rename detection, which git turns on by default, so a marker

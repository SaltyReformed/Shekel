"""Controls for ``ci.yml``'s wiring to the CI modules: every grader is judged, nothing fails green.

``ci.yml`` is wired to ``ci_scope``'s answer: every code-grading JOB is guarded
by it, the plan gate is not, the guard names the classifier, and the
``lint-and-test`` aggregate judges every grader through ``ci_verdict``.
(Re-expressed over jobs when ``bank_import:X-gy`` split the single job, the
developer confirming the change under rule 5, 2026-09-22.)  Since step X-cx's
L4 the scope job also hands each event's change set to the ``commit-trailers``
job, and the merge queue's ``merge_group`` event triggers the workflow.  Split
out of ``test_ci_scope.py`` by that step, unchanged but for this docstring and
the imports.  Since L9d the change set also goes to the ``landing`` job, which
asks the tracker about its trailers through a token minted for that run alone
(ruling balance:R-BAL311).

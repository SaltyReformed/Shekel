"""Refuse a change set whose commits break the card-trailer rules (step X-cx's L4, card plan#4).

Git only, no tracker access.  Three rules, each read with :mod:`tools.ci.trailers`,
the one reader and the one ``shipped`` rule the tracker tool also asks:

1. **Citation shape.**  Every ``Ships:`` and ``Reopens:`` trailer on the change
   set's commits names a card as ``plan#<number>``, or, until step X-cx's
   cutover (L8), the old ``<arc>:<id>`` form the plan gate reads.  Anything
   else is a citation git would silently read as naming nothing.

2. **A revert carries what keeps git's answer true to the code it changes.**
   One revert commit undoes everything ANY of its revert records names (a
   squash of several reverts is one undo, judged once), and every commit it
   undoes is in the history it LANDS on, its first parent's.  Three answers
   are asked of :func:`tools.ci.trailers.shipped`, the tracker tool's own
   rule, and nothing else here decides what shipped: NOW, over that history;
   WITHOUT, over it with the undone commits' trailers taken out; and REMOVED,
   over the undone commits' trailers alone, which names each card whose
   shipped code the revert takes away.  The revert owes ``Reopens: plan#N``
   for each card REMOVED names, unless WITHOUT ships it through a
   ``Ships:`` git cancels NOW (a ship an undone ``Reopens:`` cancelled), and
   ``Ships: plan#N`` for each card shipped WITHOUT and not NOW; nothing else.
   So undoing a ship owes ``Reopens:``, even one of several ships of a card,
   since they may be its parts (``recurrence:R16-c-2`` shipped in three),
   and even when another ``Reopens:`` already cancelled it, so that
   undoing that other one later cannot bring the ship back (both decided by
   the session under ruling ``balance:R-BAL207``).  Undoing a revert's
   ``Reopens:`` owes ``Ships:``, since the code comes back.  Undoing a ship
   with the ``Reopens:`` that cancelled it, or a ``Reopens:`` that cancelled
   nothing (what one cancels is ruling ``balance:R-BAL181``'s), owes nothing.

   **Where it errs, and which way.**  Toward OPEN: one ``Reopens:`` cancels
   every ``Ships:`` of the card before it (R-BAL181), so undoing one of
   several ships reopens the card even when what remains is all of it, and
   so does undoing a later ship after a revert brought an earlier ship's code
   back (the card was shipped, so that revert owed nothing); the card stays
   open until a commit ships it again.  Toward SHIPPED, only where parallel
   lines of history meet in a merge: a ``Reopens:`` cancels no ``Ships:`` it
   was not built on, so a ``Ships:`` on one line outlives the undo of the
   card's code on another, and a revert that also restores a cancelled ship owes nothing,
   leaving the ``Ships:`` whose code it removes standing for such a merge to
   expose.  Each revert is judged where it lands, so no rule here sees the
   merge.  A trailer a revert does not owe is not refused: a ``Ships:`` it
   carries is a claim, as on any commit.

3. **A ``Reopens:`` undoes a ``Ships:`` in its own history** (ruling
   ``balance:R-BAL309``: CI refuses "an undo naming a card its own history
   never shipped (a typo)").  A ``Reopens: plan#N`` that cancels no ``Ships:
   plan#N`` is a STRAY, :func:`tools.ci.trailers.shipped`'s own answer and no
   second spelling of it, and most likely a mistyped number.  Landed, it is
   permanent: a release counts the card it names as a change it carries, and,
   when that card moves money, beside another money change in one pull request
   it blocks every release (the money wedge, step X-cx's L9d leaf c).  One walk
   answers every commit, ``shipped`` over ``head``'s history: whether a
   ``Reopens:`` cancels a ``Ships:`` reads only whether that ``Ships:`` is in
   the ``Reopens:`` commit's own history (R-BAL181), so a ``Ships:`` anywhere
   else in ``head``'s history cancels nothing, wherever it sits (a branch
   beside it, or a later commit on its own line); and every ``Ships:`` in that
   commit's own history is in ``head``'s, since the commit is.  So the answer
   is the one each commit's own history gives.  **Each ``Reopens:`` is judged
   once, when it first lands** (the coordinator, under ``R-BAL207``,
   2026-10-17): only on the commits of the change set ``dev`` does not hold yet
   (:func:`not_on_dev`), every commit of a pull request into ``dev``, and of
   one into ``main`` a release branch's own, since what ``dev`` holds no
   commit can change (``R-BAL184``).  So this check never refuses a later pull
   request for a stray that reached ``dev`` without it (none had:
   ``origin/dev`` held no ``plan#`` trailer on 2026-10-17), or past a check no
   merge into ``dev`` requires, and undoing one owes nothing (rule 2).  The
   release tool still counts such a stray: a money one that reached ``dev``
   beside another money change blocks every release, which only a check every
   merge into ``dev`` requires can prevent.  ``dev`` is read only when the
   change set carries a ``Reopens:``, and a checkout that cannot read it
   refuses to judge.  The old ``<arc>:<id>`` form is not read here: it ends at
   the cutover (``R-BAL287``), and no ``Reopens:`` in it exists (none on any
   ref, 2026-10-17).

**What a revert is: git's own record, at the start of a line.**  ``git
revert`` writes ``This reverts commit <id>.``; with ``--reference`` the id is
shortened and followed by `` (<subject>, <date>)``; reverting a merge adds
``, reversing`` and a next line ``changes made to <parent>.``, naming the
parent it kept.  The GitHub "Revert" button writes the same.  The id must be
followed by what git writes after it (``.``, ``,``, `` (`` or the line's end),
so a sentence that merely starts with those words is not a record.  A change
undone by hand, with no such line, cannot be told from new work and is not
read.

**What a revert undoes.**  The commit it names, returning to its first parent;
for a MERGE, every commit the merge brought in beside the parent it kept
(``<parent>..<merge>``), returning to that parent, since the trailers sit on
those commits and not on the merge.  A revert naming a commit this repository
does not hold or that is not in the history the revert lands on (a rebased or
cherry-picked copy is what that history holds), a merge without the parent it
kept, or a parent that is not one of the merge's, is refused: what it undid
cannot be read, and a check that cannot read its subject has not checked it.
A commit with such a record is asked no debt either, since what it undoes is
not all known.

**The change set** is ``<base>..<head>``: the commits ``head`` holds and
``base`` does not.  ``ci.yml``'s ``scope`` job hands over the pair for a pull
request, a merge-queue group and a push to ``main``.  Rules 1 and 2 judge
every commit of it, rule 3 only those ``dev`` does not hold yet.  A change set
holding no commit is refused too: none of those events has one, so it means
the two ends are wrong.

Usage, at the repository root::

    python -m tools.ci.commit_trailers <base-sha> <head-sha>

Exit status: 0 nothing refused; 1 refused, each reason printed; 2 the command
line or git failed, ``dev`` cannot be read when rule 3 needs it, or the change
set holds no commit, so nothing was checked.  What a command line must name is
:func:`ends`, which of its commits ``dev`` does not hold yet is
:func:`not_on_dev`, and how a verdict is printed and exits is :func:`report`:
the rules and the one reporter CI's landing check (``tools/quill/landing.py``)
reads its change set by and prints its verdict with too.

"""What CI runs to grade a change, and the code repository's facts the other tools share.

The bottom layer of ``tools/``: it imports nothing else of this repository's,
so the tracker tool and the plan gate can both import from it and nothing here
can import back.  :mod:`tools.ci.arcs` is the one home of the arcs and their
planning documents; :mod:`tools.ci.ci_scope` and :mod:`tools.ci.ci_verdict`
decide what ``ci.yml`` runs and whether the required ``lint-and-test`` check
is green.  Standard library only, so CI runs it with no install.

"""What the code repository's git history says about the plan's cards: the commit trailers.

**Whether a card shipped is git's answer, never the card's open or closed
state** (ruling ``balance:R-BAL170``; the card's state is display, which the
tracker tool's ``quill sync`` writes from this module's answer).  A card is
shipped when a commit on ``dev`` carries the trailer ``Ships: plan#N`` and no
LATER commit carries ``Reopens: plan#N``.

**"Later" is git's ancestry, not a date or the merge order** (ruling
``balance:R-BAL181``).  A ``Reopens:`` commit cancels every ``Ships:`` commit
for the same card in its own history -- the commits it was built on, itself
included -- and no other: a card re-shipped after it was reopened is shipped
again, and a ``Ships:`` commit on a branch the reopening never saw still
stands.  An undo (a revert) is always built on what it undoes, so a
``Reopens:`` that cancels nothing is a STRAY -- most likely a mistyped number
-- and is reported, never acted on.

**Only the trailer block is read, and git parses it** (``%(trailers)``, the
way ``tools/plan_gate/_shipped.py`` reads ``Ships: <arc>:<id>`` until step
X-cx's cutover, L8, deletes it): a sentence that mentions ``plan#7`` claims
nothing.  A value is ``plan#<number>``, or the old ``<arc>:<id>`` form the
plan gate reads, or it is reported as malformed.  An old-form trailer is
returned as its own record (:class:`OldFormClaim`) for the release tool,
which asks what a release carries over a range: a ``Ships:`` in
:attr:`History.old_form`, a ``Reopens:`` in :attr:`History.old_form_reopens`
(none exists, measured 2026-10-14; after the cutover the release tool's card
reader refuses either, ruling ``balance:R-BAL287``).  Neither decides anything
here.  The plan gate's own walk (``_shipped._shipping_claims``) is the second
reader of the old-form ``Ships:``, and L8 deletes it with the plan gate's arms.

**A shallow clone is refused**: its history stops short, and every card
shipped before the cut would read as unshipped.

The rules live here, below both of their readers: the tracker tool asks what
shipped, and CI's ``commit_trailers`` check refuses a commit that breaks them.
Moved here from what is now ``tools/quill/_git.py`` by step X-cx's L4.  Nothing
here writes the repository.

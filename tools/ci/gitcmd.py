"""Run git in ONE repository: how the modules of ``tools/ci`` and ``tools/quill`` start git.

Every call runs ``git -C <root>`` through :func:`run`, with the variables that
bind git to some OTHER repository removed, so ``root`` alone decides which
repository is read or written.  The card-trailer rules (:mod:`tools.ci.trailers`),
the tracker tool's own git calls (``tools/quill/_git.py``) and the tests'
throwaway repositories (:mod:`tools.ci.scratch`) all start git here, but for one
call: ``scratch._prove_bound``'s control, which must reach the binding this module
removes, to prove a test's sentinel is bound.  Moved here from what is now
``tools/quill/_git.py`` by step X-cx's L4.

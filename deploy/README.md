# Deployment Configurations

This directory holds the version-controlled deployment configs for
Shekel. Two deployment modes are supported. Each mode has a distinct set
of files in this directory; the wrong mode's files are inert in the
other mode.

| Mode | Reverse proxy | Scope | Active files |
|------|---------------|-------|--------------|
| Bundled | `shekel-prod-nginx` (in-stack) | Single-stack hosts, fresh-host bring-up, the README Quick Start | `nginx-bundled/nginx.conf` |
| Shared | A separate Nginx managed outside this stack | Hosts that already run a homelab Nginx in front of multiple services | `nginx-shared/nginx.conf`, `nginx-shared/conf.d/shekel.conf`, `docker-compose.prod.yml` |

The maintainer's production homelab runs **shared mode**. Generic
deployments default to **bundled mode**.

                                        the homelab network and parks
                                        the bundled nginx in the
                                        "disabled" profile).
```

## Bundled Mode (default)

Used by the README Quick Start and by anyone bringing up Shekel on a
host that does not already have a reverse proxy.

```bash
cd /opt/shekel
docker compose up -d
```

The repo's `docker-compose.yml` mounts `deploy/nginx-bundled/nginx.conf`
into the `shekel-prod-nginx` container at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro`.
Edits to that file take effect on the next `docker compose up -d`.

To customize without forking, drop a sibling
`docker-compose.override.yml` next to `docker-compose.yml` and adjust
the `nginx.volumes` block. Do not edit the repo file in place on the
host -- the repo file is the source of truth and is reset on every
`git pull`.

## Shared Mode (homelab production)

Used when a separate, longer-lived Nginx already fronts other services
on the host (Jellyfin, Unifi, etc.). The shared Nginx is defined in a
*different* compose file on the host (`/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml`)
and is *not* in this repo.

```bash
cd /opt/shekel
docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml \
  up -d
```

In shared mode:

* `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` joins `shekel-prod-app` to the
  external `shekel-frontend` bridge network (NOT the wider `homelab`
  network) and parks the bundled `shekel-prod-nginx` service in the
  `disabled` profile, so `docker compose up -d` starts only `db`,
  `redis`, and `app`.
* The shared Nginx (managed under `/opt/docker/nginx/` on the host)
  proxies traffic to `shekel-prod-app:8000` over the `shekel-frontend`
  bridge, using the vhost in `deploy/nginx-shared/conf.d/shekel.conf`.
  Co-tenants like Jellyfin, Immich, and UniFi remain on `homelab` and
  cannot reach the Shekel app directly (audit findings F-020/F-129
  closed in Commit C-33).
* `deploy/nginx-shared/nginx.conf` is the main config for the shared
  Nginx. The repo file is the source of truth; the host copy at
  `/opt/docker/nginx/nginx.conf` must match.

The `shekel-frontend` network must exist before `docker compose up`,
with the subnet pinned so Gunicorn's `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` literal
matches and Nginx's `set_real_ip_from` directive applies:

```bash
docker network ls --filter name=shekel-frontend
# If missing:
docker network create shekel-frontend \
    --driver bridge \
    --subnet 172.32.0.0/24
```

The shared `/opt/docker/nginx` and `/opt/docker/cloudflared` containers
must also join `shekel-frontend` (in addition to the `homelab` network
they already use). Edit `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` and add the
service-level `networks:` and the file-level `networks: shekel-frontend:
external: true` block, then `docker compose up -d nginx cloudflared` to
recreate them. The detailed step list is in
`deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` under "OPERATOR PRE-FLIGHT".

`/opt/docker/cloudflared/config.yml` must also be updated so the Shekel
ingress rule routes through `http://nginx:80` instead of straight at
`http://shekel-prod-app:8000` (audit finding F-063 closed in C-33). See
the bundled-mode `cloudflared/config.yml` template for the example
shared-mode rule.

## Sync Procedure (Shared Mode)

The shared-mode files in this directory must stay in step with the
host. The repo is the source of truth.

1. Make the change in the repo on the `dev` branch and commit.
2. On the host, pull the change and copy each updated file to its
   runtime path:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/shekel
   git pull --ff-only
   sudo cp deploy/nginx-shared/nginx.conf            /opt/docker/nginx/nginx.conf
   sudo cp deploy/nginx-shared/conf.d/shekel.conf    /opt/docker/nginx/conf.d/shekel.conf
   sudo cp deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml            /opt/docker/shekel/docker-compose.override.yml
   ```
3. Validate the Nginx config before reloading:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec nginx nginx -t
   ```
4. Reload Nginx without dropping connections:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec nginx nginx -s reload
   ```
5. If only the compose override changed, recreate the affected
   containers:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/docker/shekel
   docker compose up -d
   ```

See `docs/runbook.md` -> "Shared-mode deployment" for full details
including the rollback procedure and the planned `scripts/config_audit.py`
drift check.

## Image Digest Pinning (Commit C-36)

Audit findings F-060 (`:latest` lets a single registry push silently
swap the running image) and F-155 (no Cosign / image-signature
verification) are closed by pinning the production image to an
immutable `@sha256:<digest>` reference and verifying the signature
before deploy.

### Where the pin lives

`deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` overrides the base file's
`image: ghcr.io/saltyreformed/shekel:latest` with:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/saltyreformed/shekel@${SHEKEL_IMAGE_DIGEST:?...}
```

The `:?` syntax FAILS the compose parse loudly when
`SHEKEL_IMAGE_DIGEST` is unset, so a deployment cannot accidentally
fall back to `:latest`. The host's `.env` (under
`/opt/docker/shekel/.env` in the maintainer's homelab layout) supplies
the value.

### Updating the digest

1. Build and push a new image. CI (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`)
   runs on every push to `main` and prints the digest in the
   "Image digest" workflow step output. For local builds via
   `scripts/deploy.sh`, the script prints the digest after
   `cosign sign` succeeds.

2. Verify the signature on the new digest before pinning it. The
   command depends on which signing path produced the image:

   * CI keyless OIDC (default for `main` branch pushes):
     ```bash
     cosign verify \
         --certificate-identity-regexp \
         "https://github.com/SaltyReformed/Shekel/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml@.*" \
         --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
         ghcr.io/saltyreformed/shekel@sha256:<digest>
     ```

   * Local maintainer key (`deploy/cosign.pub`):
     ```bash
     cosign verify \
         --key deploy/cosign.pub \
         ghcr.io/saltyreformed/shekel@sha256:<digest>
     ```

3. Once the verify succeeds, edit the host `.env`:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /opt/docker/shekel/.env
   # Set: SHEKEL_IMAGE_DIGEST=sha256:abc123...
   ```

4. Roll the app container to the new digest:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/docker/shekel
   docker compose pull app
   docker compose up -d app
   ```

5. Confirm the running image matches the pin:
   ```bash
   docker inspect shekel-prod-app --format '{{.Image}}'
   # Output digest must equal the value pinned in .env.
   ```

### Rollback

Restore the previous digest by editing `.env` and running steps 4-5
above. Because every successful deploy records the digest in the
host's `.env`, the on-host file is itself the rollback log; commit
your `.env` changes to a private operator-only repo if you need an
audit trail.

### Cosign keypair (local-build path)

When using `scripts/deploy.sh` for local builds, generate a Cosign
keypair once per host:

```bash
cd /opt/shekel
cosign generate-key-pair
mv cosign.pub deploy/cosign.pub
# Move the private key to a path outside the repo and chmod 600 it.
chmod 600 cosign.key
mv cosign.key /etc/shekel/cosign.key
```

Commit `deploy/cosign.pub` to the repo. Set the `COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY`
path in the host `.env` so `scripts/deploy.sh` can find it. The
private key file MUST NOT be checked into git (`.gitignore` already
excludes `cosign.key*`).

For CI builds, no keypair is needed: the workflow uses sigstore's
keyless OIDC flow, so the maintainer just verifies with the
`--certificate-identity-regexp` form above.

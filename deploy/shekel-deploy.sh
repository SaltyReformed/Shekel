# Every run dumps the database before it touches the pin, and refuses to
# re-pin when the previous image cannot resolve the schema revision the
# database has been left at.  The notes below say why.

# ── Which copy of this file is actually running ────────────────────
# The canonical copy is `deploy/shekel-deploy.sh` in the Shekel repository.
# The INTENDED install (developer ruling 2026-08-08) makes
# /opt/docker/scripts/shekel-deploy.sh -- which /usr/local/bin/shekel-deploy
# symlinks -- a SYMLINK to that copy, so the two cannot drift:
#
#   sudo ln -sfn /home/josh/projects/Shekel/deploy/shekel-deploy.sh \
#                /opt/docker/scripts/shekel-deploy.sh
#
# Until that link exists the host carries a HAND-COPY, and a hand-copy is how
# finding F-14 happened: the one path that rolls production was untracked and
# unreviewed, which is why F-8 below survived unnoticed.  This script does not
# assert which arrangement is in place -- it MEASURES it at startup
# (`report_installed_copy`) and says so in its own output, because a comment
# claiming "these are the same file" is exactly the claim that goes stale.
#
# Accepted cost of the symlink, ruled: the CHECKED-OUT WORKING TREE becomes
# the live deploy path.  A half-finished edit or a feature branch is live the
# moment it is saved.  Check out the revision you mean to deploy from.
#
# ── F-8, and what this script does about it ────────────────────────
# Plan step R-F8, ruling R-R14.  Migrations run at entrypoint step 3, BEFORE
# the health check, so a failed deploy can leave the database stamped at a
# revision the other image's Alembic tree does not contain.  That image then
# dies at step 3 too, and re-pinning it turns one dead container into two --
# reproduced on revision d4a71f6e30bb as `CommandError: Can't locate revision`.
#
# THE QUESTION IS NOT "does this release add migrations".  That is directional,
# and it gets the rollback case backwards: deploying an OLDER image adds
# nothing while being exactly the image that cannot resolve today's schema.
# The question is "can image X resolve the revision the database is stamped
# at", asked of the real `alembic_version` row.  So:
#
#   * before anything is written, the TARGET must be able to resolve the
#     revision the database is stamped at now -- otherwise it would die at
#     step 3 and the deploy is refused up front;
#   * every deploy takes a pg_dump -Fc first; no dump, no deploy;
#   * after a failure the stamp is RE-READ, and the pin is reverted only if
#     the previous image can resolve what the database now says.  Otherwise
#     the script names the dump and stops.  A release that migrated nothing
#     leaves the stamp untouched, so it still rolls back automatically -- 6 of
#     the last 10 releases were pure digest reverts.
#
# Since plan step balance:X-cv, entrypoint step 3 is ONE transaction: the
# migrations and the three deploy hooks in `scripts/init_database.py` commit
# together or not at all.  So a failure INSIDE step 3 -- a migration that
# errors, a hook that refuses -- leaves the stamp where it was, and this script
# re-pins the previous image even for a migration-bearing release.  Only a
# failure AFTER step 3 has committed (a later entrypoint step, or the health
# check) leaves the new stamp, and that is the case the refusal still meets.
# The re-read stamp is still the only question; since X-cv it is read only
# after the target image's container has been STOPPED, and FOR SHARE, so a
# step 3 still in flight cannot commit behind the read
# (`stop_failed_container`, `db_stamped_revisions`).  Before
# re-pinning, the failed container's log is saved beside the dump, because
# re-pinning recreates the container and `docker logs` then shows the previous
# image instead (`save_failed_container_log`).
#
# Shekel's prod image is pinned in /opt/docker/shekel/.env via
# SHEKEL_IMAGE_DIGEST (the compose override consumes it as
# `ghcr.io/saltyreformed/shekel@${SHEKEL_IMAGE_DIGEST:?...}`).
# bump-digest.sh can't touch this because it rejects env-var-templated
# images on purpose -- this script is the canonical path for shekel.

# tested by reading it.  `scripts/deploy.sh` states the same convention.

# Financial-Calculation Follow-up Remediation Plan -- F-24, F-25, and F-26

Implementation plan that closes three NOT_DONE items in
`remediation_follow_up.md` after the first follow-up chain
(`remediation_follow_up_plan.md` Commits 1-22) landed.  F-24 and
F-25 were authored 2026-05-21 against the post-gate `dev` branch;
F-26 (the residual templates / transfers R0801 duplicates that the
F-24 helper extraction did not address) was added the same day
after gate-time pylint surfaced six additional pairs outside
F-24's scope.  F-26's scope is itself partitioned: pairs 1 and 2
(stale-form check, RecurrenceConflict flash) close cleanly via
two new helpers in the existing F-24 module; pairs 3 through 6
(list-rendering shapes, hard-delete archive-fallback body
wrapping) are explicitly deferred per Section 9 because each one
needs its own design discussion that does not fit the F-26
commit's scope.

## 0. Context

The first follow-up plan (`remediation_follow_up_plan.md` Commits 1-22)
closed every audit-time NOT_DONE / PARTIAL item except F-24 (templates
/ transfers route-layer duplication, surfaced during the first plan's
Commit 8) and F-25 (pylint R0401 cyclic-import warnings introduced by
the Commit-21 accounts-package split).  F-26 (the residual templates /
transfers R0801 duplicates beyond F-24's scope) was discovered at the
gate-time pylint run for this plan's Commit 2 and recorded the same
day (commit `b7d4258`); the F-26 entry's six pairs are listed in
`remediation_follow_up.md::F-26`.  All three findings are quality /
structural refactors with no financial-calculation correctness signal
-- they fix pylint warnings that score 0/baseline-impact today but
represent latent hazards that the project's DRY/SOLID standards say
must be closed.

Verification of the documented state of each finding against the
live codebase produced the scope additions in Section 3.  F-24's and
F-26's write-ups in `remediation_follow_up.md` understate the true
surface slightly; F-24's addition is folded into Commit 2's
specification, F-26's partition is captured in Section 2 and Section
9 because pairs 3-6 are deliberately deferred rather than absorbed.

The same constraints that governed the first follow-up plan apply
here:

- You are the only safeguard. CI gates the merge, but a missed
  assertion ships defective behaviour into production.
- Decimal-from-strings for any monetary value; IDs and boolean
  columns for business logic; never compare against ref-table `name`
  strings. (Neither finding touches financial math; the rule is
  cited for completeness.)
- DRY / SOLID / fully normalized schema.
- Type-hinted, substantive docstrings, specific exceptions, no
  Unicode em/en dashes.
- Never modify a test to make it pass. Both commits here are
  pure refactors; if any test fails the code is wrong.

## 1. Hard rules for executing this plan

Inherits every rule from
`docs/audits/financial_calculations/remediation_follow_up_common.md`
("Apply these rules (every commit)") verbatim; the floor is not the
ceiling. The additions that follow are specific to this plan:

1. **Run commits in order.** Section 6 records dependencies; F-25
   lands first because it is a single-package restructure with zero
   test edits, then F-24 because it is a wider multi-file extraction
   that benefits from a clean tree to diff against, then F-26
   because its two new helpers extend the F-24 helper module and
   must land against the post-F-24 shape.
2. **Re-grep cited lines first.** Numbers below are accurate at
   authoring time.  F-24 / F-25 numbers were captured against head
   `a0782f7` (2026-05-21); F-26 numbers are captured against head
   `b7d4258` (the F-26 doc entry, 2026-05-21).  They will drift as
   the chain lands -- re-grep before editing.
3. **Refactors must be byte-equivalent at the wire level.** None of
   the three commits changes route behaviour; the acceptance
   criterion is "every existing template + transfer-template CRUD
   test passes unchanged" plus "pylint warnings F-24 / F-25 / F-26
   cite are gone (with the partition-aware caveat documented in
   Section 2 for F-26 pairs 3-6)."  A test that fails after any of
   the three commits indicates the refactor introduced a semantic
   drift, not a stale assertion.
4. **Targeted pytest during edits; pylint `app/ --fail-on=E,F` clean;
   full pytest as the per-commit final gate** -- via
   `./scripts/test.sh`. Pylint must show **no new R0401 / R0801
   warnings** vs the post-gate baseline, and the specific warnings
   each commit targets must be gone.
5. **No migrations.** Neither commit touches the schema.
6. **No new packages.** Every helper extracted here reuses existing
   Flask / SQLAlchemy / stdlib primitives.
7. **Stay in scope.** Out-of-scope items surfaced during execution
   land in `remediation_follow_up.md` as a new F-N entry, never
   inline. The F-24 scope addition (Section 3) is the only such item
   the plan absorbs at authoring time.
8. **Do not push.** After every commit lands locally and the full
   suite is green, present results and ask before pushing to `dev`
   (CI runs; PR-to-`main` is required for promotion per
   `CLAUDE.md` Git Workflow).

---

## 2. Design decisions made for this plan

Captured at plan time so the developer can audit them before
execution.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **F-25 fix shape** | Option B (move `accounts_bp` declaration to a dedicated `app/routes/accounts/_bp.py` module) | The cycle is real (`app/routes/accounts/__init__.py` imports each submodule for the side effect of registering decorators; each submodule imports `accounts_bp` from the package init). Moving the blueprint declaration to a leaf module breaks the package -> submodule -> package round-trip pylint flags. Mechanical refactor across five files. Option A (accept the warning) is rejected because the developer opted to land the refactor at plan-presentation time. |
| **F-24 helper location** | New `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py` (route-layer, not service) | `handle_stale_conflict` needs Flask `flash`, `redirect`, `url_for` -- co-locating it in a service module would violate the project's "services are isolated from Flask" boundary (`CLAUDE.md::Architecture`). `build_recurrence_rule_from_form` is pure-data but co-locates naturally with its sibling. Leading underscore marks the module as route-internal, consistent with `app/routes/_route_audit.py` and similar internal helpers in the project. |
| **F-24 scope** | Helpers close every R0801 pair currently flagged across `app/routes/templates.py` and `app/routes/transfers.py`, not only the three pairs the F-24 write-up names | Verification surfaced 9 distinct R0801 matches between the two files. Six of them are variations of the `try: db.session.commit() except StaleDataError: rollback + log + flash + redirect` shape across archive / unarchive / hard-delete routes. Leaving them in place would mean the second helper (`handle_stale_conflict`) gets defined for two callers and used by only one of them -- a half-finished extraction the common rules explicitly forbid ("No half-finished implementations either"). |
| **`due_day_of_month` asymmetry** | Helper accepts an `include_due_day_of_month: bool` keyword, defaulting `False` | The `due_day_of_month` field is populated only from `TransactionTemplate` create/update schemas; the transfer-template schemas do not have it. The original duplication carried this asymmetry implicitly (transfers.py simply did not pop the key). The keyword makes the asymmetry explicit and self-documenting at every call site. |
| **F-24 helper return shape** | `build_recurrence_rule_from_form` returns `RecurrenceRule \| None`; `handle_stale_conflict` returns a Flask `Response` (the redirect) | Returning the response keeps the route's control flow identical to the pre-extraction shape (the route does `return handle_stale_conflict(...)`); the developer reading the route sees the same redirect-on-error pattern. An exception-based design (`raise StaleConflictRedirect(...)`) was considered and rejected as control-flow obfuscation for a one-line caller. |
| **F-26 fix shape** | Two new helpers (`handle_stale_form_conflict`, `handle_recurrence_conflict`) added to the existing `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py` module | Both helpers share scope (templates / transfers CRUD route boundary) and Flask coupling (`flash`, `redirect`, `url_for`) with F-24's two helpers; one route-internal helper module keeps the surface compact and the four helpers discoverable together.  Creating a sibling module per helper category would fragment cohesion for no readability gain. |
| **F-26 partition** | Implement pairs 1 (stale-form check) and 2 (RecurrenceConflict flash); explicitly defer pairs 3, 4, 5 (list-rendering shapes) and 6 (hard-delete archive-fallback body wrapping) | Pairs 1 and 2 share F-24's "small Flask-aware helper with route-specific kwargs" shape and close with low blast radius.  Pairs 3-5 need a list-rendering helper or class-based view -- different abstraction, more invasive.  Pair 6 needs a shared archive helper that takes a model-specific soft-delete callable -- design discussion warranted (the templates side soft-deletes via a bare `db.session.query(...).update(...)`; the transfers side delegates per-row to `transfer_service.delete_transfer` to maintain shadow invariants).  Bundling all six into one commit would mix three distinct design questions; the deferral keeps the F-26 commit focused. |
| **F-26 helper return shapes** | `handle_stale_form_conflict` returns a Flask `Response` (mirror of `handle_stale_conflict`); `handle_recurrence_conflict` returns `None` (just logs and flashes; caller continues executing) | The two pairs have structurally different post-condition shapes.  Stale-form is an early-return guard (the route cannot proceed; redirect immediately), exactly the F-24 `handle_stale_conflict` shape.  RecurrenceConflict is a Phase-1 "auto-keep overrides" advisory: the route logs the conflict, flashes a warning, then continues with the commit.  Returning a Response for the second helper would change route behaviour (would early-return where the existing code falls through), violating the byte-equivalence acceptance. |

---

## 3. Scope additions surfaced during verification

Re-verifying each finding against the live code uncovered two scope
additions.  R-FU-3 is folded into F-24's commit because it is the
same DRY violation F-24 already names; R-FU-4 is its own follow-up
entry (F-26) because the additional pairs span design questions
F-24 cannot answer.

- **R-FU-3 (F-24 surface is wider than the entry documents).** The
  F-24 write-up names three R0801 pairs:
  - Recurrence-rule construction in *create* paths
  - Recurrence-rule construction in *update* paths
  - `RecurrenceConflict` / `StaleDataError` flash handlers
  Re-running `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0801 app/routes/transfers.py
  app/routes/templates.py` against `dev` (head `a0782f7`) surfaces
  **nine** distinct R0801 matches. The three F-24-named pairs are
  present; the other six are variations of the
  `try: commit() except StaleDataError: rollback + log + flash +
  redirect` shape in archive (`archive_template` /
  `archive_transfer_template`), unarchive (`unarchive_template` /
  `unarchive_transfer_template`), and hard-delete
  (`hard_delete_template` / `hard_delete_transfer_template`) routes.
  All nine close cleanly with `handle_stale_conflict`. Commit 2
  closes them as a single sweep so the helper does not get extracted
  and left half-applied.

- **R-FU-4 (additional R0801 pairs surfaced post-F-24).** Gate-time
  pylint after F-24 landed (head `70b473a`) showed six additional
  R0801 pairs between `templates.py` and `transfers.py` that were
  never in F-24's scope.  Captured as F-26 in commit `b7d4258`
  (`remediation_follow_up.md`).  The six pairs partition into three
  shapes: F-24-mirror helpers close pairs 1 (stale-form check) and
  2 (RecurrenceConflict flash); pairs 3-5 (list-rendering shapes)
  and pair 6 (hard-delete archive-fallback body wrapping) each
  need their own design discussion and are deferred per Section 9.
  Commit 3 implements pairs 1 and 2; the gate (Commit 4) verifies
  both closed pairs are gone from pylint while explicitly tolerating
  the four deferred pairs remaining.

---

## 4. Verification status table

Result of re-grepping every claim in the F-24, F-25, and F-26
entries against the current `dev` branch.

| Item | Claim re-verified | Drift found? | Maps to commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-24 -- "three duplicated blocks" between templates.py and transfers.py | YES (named pairs all confirmed) | Wider surface: nine R0801 matches, not three (see Section 3) | C2 |
| F-24 -- "no behavioural change required" | YES (every difference is identifier-level: redirect URL, log message, schema field set) | None | C2 |
| F-24 -- "RecurrenceRule difference is `due_day_of_month` only" | YES (transfer schemas omit the field; templates schemas include it) | None | C2 |
| F-25 -- "four R0401 cyclic-import warnings rooted at `app/utils/account_validation.py:1`" | YES (`app.routes.accounts -> {crud, detail, anchor, types}` each cited once) | None | C1 |
| F-25 -- "package -> submodule -> package round-trip is the cycle" | YES (`__init__.py:54-57` imports submodules; each submodule imports `accounts_bp` from the package) | None | C1 |
| F-25 -- "`accounts_bp` has no `url_prefix` for behavioural reasons" | YES (decorators carry `/accounts` verbatim; preserving that is an F-1 acceptance criterion) | None (constraint must be preserved through the refactor) | C1 |
| F-26 -- "stale-form check (pair 1) is byte-identical apart from the route id and the redirect endpoint" | YES (`templates.py:319-339` vs `transfers.py:338-355`; both log submitted vs current counters before the flash + redirect) | None | C3 |
| F-26 -- "RecurrenceConflict flash (pair 2) carries identical copy apart from the noun" | YES (`templates.py:418-431` vs `transfers.py:430-443`; auto-keep-overrides Phase-1 advisory shape) | None | C3 |
| F-26 -- "list-rendering pairs 3-5 need a different abstraction" | YES (the partition logic is shared but the render-template path and per-model query shape diverge) | None | deferred (Section 9) |
| F-26 -- "hard-delete archive-fallback body wrapping (pair 6) needs model-specific soft-delete callable" | YES (templates side: bare ORM update; transfers side: per-row service delegation for shadow invariants) | None | deferred (Section 9) |

## 5. Commit checklist

Three implementation commits plus a final gate.  Each row is one
git commit; messages use `<type>(<scope>): <what>` per Definition
of Done.

| # | Commit message | Closes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `refactor(routes): move accounts_bp to dedicated module to break import cycle (F-25)` | F-25 |
| 2 | `refactor(routes): extract recurrence-rule and stale-conflict helpers for templates/transfers (F-24)` | F-24 |
| 3 | `refactor(routes): extract stale-form and recurrence-conflict helpers for templates/transfers (F-26 partial)` | F-26 (pairs 1-2) |
| 4 | `chore(release): F-24/F-25/F-26 follow-up final gate` | -- |

---

## 6. Commit dependency analysis

```text
Independent (no cross-commit dependencies):
  1 F-25 accounts package restructure

Sequential (each commit extends the prior surface):
  2 F-24 templates/transfers helper extraction
  3 F-26 stale-form + recurrence-conflict helpers
    (depends on Commit 2 -- extends the F-24 module)

Final gate:
  4 full suite + pylint + R0401 / R0801 verification
    (checks F-25, F-24, F-26 acceptance and the deferred F-26
     pairs 3-6 still surface as known-tolerated)
```

Ordering rationale: F-25 first because it is a single-package
mechanical refactor with no test edits and no behavioural surface
-- a clean warm-up.  F-24 second because it is the multi-file
extraction with new helpers and the new helper-unit tests; it
creates `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py` which Commit 3
extends.  F-26 third because its two helpers are additive to the
F-24 module and the F-26 call-site refactor touches the same
update routes F-24 just refactored -- landing them in lockstep
keeps the diffs reviewable separately.  The final gate runs all
three verification suites together.

## 7. Commits (detailed)

Each commit follows: A message, B problem, C files, D implementation,
E tests, F manual verification, G downstream, H rollback.

### Commit 1 -- Move `accounts_bp` to dedicated module to break import cycle (F-25)

**A. Commit message** `refactor(routes): move accounts_bp to dedicated module to break import cycle (F-25)`

**B. Problem statement** Pylint reports four `R0401 Cyclic import`
warnings rooted at `app/utils/account_validation.py:1`:

```
R0401: Cyclic import (app.routes.accounts -> app.routes.accounts.crud)
R0401: Cyclic import (app.routes.accounts -> app.routes.accounts.detail)
R0401: Cyclic import (app.routes.accounts -> app.routes.accounts.anchor)
R0401: Cyclic import (app.routes.accounts -> app.routes.accounts.types)
```

The cycle flows from the Commit-21 (F-1) blueprint split:
`app/routes/accounts/__init__.py:54-57` imports each submodule for
the side effect of registering its route decorators; each submodule
(`crud.py:42`, `anchor.py:36`, `types.py:26`, `detail.py:35`) imports
`accounts_bp` from `app.routes.accounts`, which pylint traces back to
the package init and reports as cyclic. The cycle is real but benign
at runtime because submodule reads of `accounts_bp` happen during
their module body execution -- by the time
`from app.routes.accounts import crud` returns, `accounts_bp` is
already bound in the package namespace.

Score impact today is zero (`9.57/10 (previous run: 9.57/10, +0.00)`
at the F-24/F-25 gate authoring time); the warning is a refactor
hint, not an error. The fix removes the warning so future cyclic
imports surface as new offenders, not lost in the noise of four
known-accepted ones.

**C. Files modified**

- `app/routes/accounts/_bp.py` (new) -- one-line module that declares
  `accounts_bp` and carries the rationale docstring currently in
  `__init__.py:38-46`.
- `app/routes/accounts/__init__.py` -- replaces the `accounts_bp =
  Blueprint(...)` declaration with `from app.routes.accounts._bp
  import accounts_bp` (re-export so existing
  `from app.routes.accounts import accounts_bp` consumers stay
  valid); preserves the side-effect submodule imports.
- `app/routes/accounts/crud.py` -- imports
  `accounts_bp` from `app.routes.accounts._bp` instead of the package.
- `app/routes/accounts/anchor.py` -- same.
- `app/routes/accounts/types.py` -- same.
- `app/routes/accounts/detail.py` -- same.

**D. Implementation approach**

1. Read `app/routes/accounts/__init__.py` end-to-end (57 lines) to
   confirm the current shape and capture the "no `url_prefix`"
   rationale docstring.
2. Read each submodule's import block (`crud.py:1-50`,
   `anchor.py:1-40`, `types.py:1-30`, `detail.py:1-40`) to confirm
   each one imports `accounts_bp` from `app.routes.accounts`. None
   of the submodules should import sibling submodules; if any do,
   the cycle is wider than F-25 documents and the plan needs
   revision before continuing.
3. Create `app/routes/accounts/_bp.py`:
   ```python
   """
   Shekel Budget App -- Accounts Package Blueprint Declaration

   Holds the ``accounts_bp`` ``Blueprint`` instance in a leaf module
   so the per-sub-domain modules can import it without going back
   through ``app.routes.accounts.__init__``.  Pre-F-25 the blueprint
   lived in the package init, which meant the package <-> submodule
   import round-trip surfaced as four pylint ``R0401 Cyclic import``
   warnings rooted at ``app/utils/account_validation.py:1``.

   No ``url_prefix`` is set: every route decorator in the sibling
   modules carries the ``/accounts`` prefix explicitly (preserved
   verbatim from the pre-split monolith).  Adding ``url_prefix``
   here would require stripping every decorator's prefix in
   lockstep -- a behavioural change the F-1 acceptance criteria
   explicitly forbids.
   """
   from flask import Blueprint

   accounts_bp = Blueprint("accounts", __name__)
   ```
4. Rewrite `app/routes/accounts/__init__.py`:
   - Keep the module docstring (it documents the package layout for
     readers).
   - Replace the `accounts_bp = Blueprint(...)` declaration with
     `from app.routes.accounts._bp import accounts_bp` and add a
     comment explaining why the declaration moved.
   - Preserve the `from app.routes.accounts import crud` ... side-
     effect imports verbatim (their semantics are unchanged; only
     the source of `accounts_bp` has moved).
   - Optionally add `__all__ = ["accounts_bp"]` to make the re-
     export explicit (and silence any future linter that flags the
     `noqa: F401` re-export).
5. In each submodule (`crud.py`, `anchor.py`, `types.py`,
   `detail.py`), change the import:
   ```python
   from app.routes.accounts import accounts_bp
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   from app.routes.accounts._bp import accounts_bp
   ```
   No other change to any submodule -- the route decorators
   continue to bind against the same blueprint instance.
6. Verify `from app.routes.accounts import accounts_bp` still
   resolves (used by `app/__init__.py:443`); the re-export in
   `__init__.py` preserves that path.

**E. Test cases**

- C1-1 every existing test in `tests/test_routes/test_accounts.py`
  passes unchanged (137 tests; the URL surface and route behaviour
  are byte-equivalent).
- C1-2 add a one-line unit test in
  `tests/test_routes/test_accounts.py` (or `test_app_factory.py` if
  one exists) asserting
  `app.routes.accounts.accounts_bp is app.routes.accounts._bp.accounts_bp`
  -- pins the re-export contract so a future cleanup that drops the
  re-export would fail loud.
- C1-3 `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0401 app/` shows zero matches
  rooted in `app/routes/accounts/` or
  `app/utils/account_validation.py`.

**F. Manual verification steps**

1. `grep -rn "from app.routes.accounts import accounts_bp" /home/josh/projects/Shekel/`
   returns matches only at the top of `app/__init__.py` (the
   factory-time blueprint registration) and any test fixture that
   imports the symbol -- never from a sibling submodule.
2. `grep -rn "from app.routes.accounts._bp import accounts_bp" /home/josh/projects/Shekel/`
   returns matches in all four submodules and the package init
   (the re-export source).
3. `python -c "from app.routes.accounts import accounts_bp; print(accounts_bp.name)"`
   prints `accounts`.
4. Start the dev server; visit `/accounts`, click into a checking
   account, edit an anchor, edit an account, create / delete an
   account type. All five sub-domain flows route correctly.

**G. Downstream effects** None at the user surface; URLs and
behaviours are byte-equivalent. The pylint R0401 noise is gone, so
future genuine cyclic-import regressions in the project will surface
as new offenders rather than getting lost in the four known-accepted
warnings.

**H. Rollback notes** `git revert`. The split is a pure
re-organisation; the package init can be restored verbatim from
history.

### Commit 2 -- Extract recurrence-rule and stale-conflict helpers for templates/transfers (F-24)

**A. Commit message** `refactor(routes): extract recurrence-rule and stale-conflict helpers for templates/transfers (F-24)`

**B. Problem statement** `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0801
app/routes/templates.py app/routes/transfers.py` reports nine
distinct R0801 (similar-lines) duplicates between the two CRUD
modules:

- Two `recurrence_pattern` + `RecurrenceRule(...)` blocks in the
  create / update paths (`templates.py:191-201` vs
  `transfers.py:169-179`; `templates.py:347-352` vs
  `transfers.py:357-362`).
- One `recurrence_pattern is None` short-circuit pair
  (`templates.py:341-346` vs `transfers.py:174-179`,
  `templates.py:196-201` vs `transfers.py:351-356`).
- Six variations of the
  `try: db.session.commit() except StaleDataError: rollback +
  logger.info + flash + redirect` shape across the create, update,
  archive, unarchive, and hard-delete paths
  (`templates.py:[437-442, 484-489, 537-542, 607-613, 638-644]` vs
  `transfers.py:[442-447, 507-512, 574-579, 662-668, 710-716]`).

Each pair has one route-specific axis -- the `due_day_of_month` field
exists only on transaction-template schemas, the redirect endpoints
differ per route, and the log messages name the route -- so a literal
extraction is not a one-liner. The shape is otherwise byte-equivalent
across both modules. The duplication is stylistic, not behavioural,
but it sits at the largest contiguous shared surface in
`app/routes/` and consolidating it both removes the R0801 noise and
centralises two project-wide error-handling contracts (stale-conflict
flash language, recurrence-rule construction).

**C. Files modified**

- `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py` (new) -- two helpers:
  - `build_recurrence_rule_from_form(data, user_id, *,
    include_due_day_of_month) -> RecurrenceRule | None`
  - `handle_stale_conflict(*, logger, route_log_id, edit_endpoint,
    edit_kwargs, flash_message) -> Response`
- `app/routes/templates.py` -- call the helpers in
  `create_template`, `update_template`, `archive_template`,
  `unarchive_template`, `hard_delete_template`.
- `app/routes/transfers.py` -- same in
  `create_transfer_template`, `update_transfer_template`,
  `archive_transfer_template`, `unarchive_transfer_template`,
  `hard_delete_transfer_template`. Each transfer-side call passes
  `include_due_day_of_month=False`.
- `tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_form_helpers.py` (new) --
  unit tests for both helpers covering the no-pattern path, the
  every-N-periods auto-offset path, the `due_day_of_month` axis,
  and the stale-conflict redirect shape.

**D. Implementation approach**

1. Read each cited block in `app/routes/templates.py` and
   `app/routes/transfers.py` in full to confirm the bodies match
   the pylint output (every line is what the helper will replace).
2. Read `app/models/recurrence_rule.RecurrenceRule.__init__` to
   confirm the kwargs the helper passes.
3. Create `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py`:
   ```python
   """
   Shekel Budget App -- Recurrence-Form Route Helpers

   Two helpers shared between the transaction-template
   (:mod:`app.routes.templates`) and transfer-template
   (:mod:`app.routes.transfers`) CRUD routes:

   * :func:`build_recurrence_rule_from_form` -- consumes a
     Marshmallow-validated payload, pops the recurrence-related
     keys, and returns a fresh :class:`RecurrenceRule` or ``None``.
   * :func:`handle_stale_conflict` -- emits the canonical
     stale-conflict flash + redirect when a commit raises
     :class:`StaleDataError`.

   Route-layer module rather than service because
   :func:`handle_stale_conflict` consumes Flask ``flash`` /
   ``redirect`` / ``url_for``; ``CLAUDE.md::Architecture`` keeps
   services isolated from Flask globals.  The leading underscore
   marks the module as route-internal.

4. Refactor `app/routes/templates.py::create_template`:

       build_recurrence_rule_from_form,
       handle_stale_conflict,
   )
   # ... inside the route, replacing the existing block:

   if isinstance(rule_or_redirect, Response):
       return rule_or_redirect
   rule = rule_or_redirect  # RecurrenceRule | None
   ```
5. Repeat for `update_template` (pass
   `redirect_endpoint="templates.edit_template"`,
   `redirect_endpoint_kwargs={"template_id": template_id}`).
6. Replace each `try: db.session.commit() except StaleDataError:`
   block with:
   ```python
   try:
       db.session.commit()
   except StaleDataError:
       return handle_stale_conflict(
           logger=logger,
           route_log_id=template.id,
           route_log_label="update_template",
           edit_endpoint="templates.edit_template",
           edit_endpoint_kwargs={"template_id": template_id},
           noun="recurring transaction",
       )
   ```
   Preserve any sibling `except IntegrityError:` branches unchanged
   -- they have route-specific bodies that do not generalise.
7. Mirror in `app/routes/transfers.py` with
   `include_due_day_of_month=False`,
   `noun="recurring transfer"`, and the matching endpoint names.
8. The update-path's existing-rule mutation branch
   (`if template.recurrence_rule: template.recurrence_rule.pattern_id =
   pattern.id; ...`) does NOT extract cleanly -- it mutates an
   existing rule rather than constructing a new one. Leave that
   branch in place; only the `else: rule = RecurrenceRule(...)`
   branch routes through the helper (matches the helper's "construct
   fresh rule" contract). The R0801 match on the mutation branch
   stays; it is acceptable because the only alternative (a second
   helper for the mutation path) would amount to "set every field
   from `data.pop` calls" which adds no abstraction value over the
   inline form.
9. Pylint after each route edit to confirm the targeted R0801
   warnings are gone and no new R0801 / R0401 has appeared.

**E. Test cases**

The helper unit tests live in
`tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_form_helpers.py` (new file). The
existing CRUD route tests cover the helper through its integration
surface; the new file pins helper-internal contracts.

- C2-1 `build_recurrence_rule_from_form` with `recurrence_pattern=None`
  returns `None` and pops every recurrence key from the data dict
  (including `due_day_of_month` when `include_due_day_of_month=True`).
- C2-2 with an invalid `recurrence_pattern` id, returns a Flask
  redirect `Response` (status 302) targeting the `redirect_endpoint`
  and flashes "Invalid recurrence pattern."
- C2-3 with `pattern_id_str = EVERY_N_PERIODS` and a valid
  `start_period`, derives `offset_periods = start_period.period_index
  % interval_n` and constructs the rule. Hand-arithmetic for
  `period_index=37`, `interval_n=4`: `37 % 4 = 1`.
- C2-4 with `pattern_id_str = EVERY_N_PERIODS` and an invalid
  `start_period_id` (does not exist), returns a Flask redirect
  `Response` and flashes "Invalid start period."
- C2-5 with `include_due_day_of_month=True` and
  `due_day_of_month=15` in the data, the constructed rule has
  `due_day_of_month=15` and the data dict no longer contains the
  key. With `include_due_day_of_month=False`, the constructed rule
  has no `due_day_of_month` attribute set (the constructor default
  applies) and the data dict is not probed for the key.
- C2-6 `handle_stale_conflict` rolls back the session, logs at
  INFO with the label and id in the message, flashes the canonical
  string with the noun substituted, and returns a 302 redirect to
  the `edit_endpoint`.
- C2-7 the existing templates / transfers CRUD route tests pass
  unchanged (every route's wire-level behaviour is identical).
- C2-8 `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0801 app/routes/templates.py
  app/routes/transfers.py` shows no matches for any of the nine
  pre-extraction pairs. (Some R0801 matches may remain on the
  existing-rule mutation branch -- the design decision in Section
  2 explicitly accepts those.)

**F. Manual verification steps**

1. `grep -nF "build_recurrence_rule_from_form" app/routes/` returns
   matches in `templates.py`, `transfers.py`, and the helper module.
2. `grep -nF "handle_stale_conflict" app/routes/` returns matches in
   `templates.py`, `transfers.py`, and the helper module; ten call
   sites total (five per file, one per mutation route).
3. `grep -nF "_STALE_CONFLICT_FLASH" app/` returns one match (the
   helper module).
4. `grep -nE "except StaleDataError:" app/routes/templates.py
   app/routes/transfers.py` returns five matches per file -- one per
   mutation route -- each followed by the `return
   handle_stale_conflict(...)` call.
5. Start the dev server. Create a recurring transaction template
   with the EVERY_N_PERIODS pattern; assert the rule's offset is
   `period_index % interval_n`. Open the same template in two
   browser tabs, edit and save the first, then save the second --
   the second should display the canonical stale-conflict flash and
   redirect to the edit form. Repeat for transfer templates.
6. Full test suite green.

**G. Downstream effects** Future templates / transfers CRUD edits
inherit two well-tested helpers; new routes that need either contract
do not re-implement the body. The stale-conflict flash language is
now centralised, so a future copy edit lives in one place.

**H. Rollback notes** `git revert`. Both helpers are additive; the
inlined bodies can be restored verbatim from history per route. If
only one helper proves problematic, the per-route revert is
mechanical (the helper module stays, the affected route returns to
its pre-extraction body).

### Commit 3 -- Extract stale-form and recurrence-conflict helpers for templates/transfers (F-26 partial)

**A. Commit message** `refactor(routes): extract stale-form and recurrence-conflict helpers for templates/transfers (F-26 partial)`

**B. Problem statement** F-24's gate (Commit 2 above) surfaced six
additional R0801 pairs between `templates.py` and `transfers.py`
that F-24's helpers did not close because they were never in
F-24's scope.  Captured as F-26 in commit `b7d4258`.  Of the six,
two pairs share the structural shape F-24's `handle_stale_conflict`
addresses and close cleanly with two sibling helpers:

- **Pair 1 -- Stale-form check (optimistic-locking version_id
  mismatch).** `templates.py:[319:339]` vs
  `transfers.py:[338:355]`.  The
  `if submitted_version is not None and submitted_version !=
  template.version_id: ... logger.info(... flash(... redirect(...)`
  block is byte-identical apart from the route id, the noun, and
  the redirect endpoint.  Closes with a
  `handle_stale_form_conflict` helper mirroring the
  `handle_stale_conflict` shape; logs both the submitted and
  current counters so post-mortem analysis can reconstruct the
  race (the original code did this verbatim).
- **Pair 2 -- RecurrenceConflict logger.warning + flash.**
  `templates.py:[418:431]` vs `transfers.py:[430:443]`.  The
  Phase-1 auto-keep-overrides advisory carries identical copy
  apart from the noun.  Closes with a `handle_recurrence_conflict`
  helper that logs the override / delete counts and flashes the
  canonical "kept as-is" message with the route-specific noun.
  Returns `None` (not `Response`) because the caller continues
  executing after the flash; this differs from `handle_stale_*`
  helpers which early-return.

Pairs 3 through 6 are deferred per Section 9 because each one
needs its own design discussion (list-rendering pairs need a
different abstraction; hard-delete archive-fallback needs a
model-specific soft-delete callable).

**C. Files modified**

- `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py` -- add two helpers:
  - `handle_stale_form_conflict(*, logger, log_label, log_id,
    submitted, current, flash_message, redirect_endpoint,
    redirect_endpoint_kwargs=None) -> Response`
  - `handle_recurrence_conflict(*, logger, noun, conflict) -> None`
  Plus an `_RECURRENCE_CONFLICT_FLASH` module-level template for
  the canonical "Note: N overridden and M deleted entries were
  kept as-is." string.
- `app/routes/templates.py::update_template` -- replace the inline
  version_id mismatch block (around the `submitted_version` pop)
  with `return handle_stale_form_conflict(...)`; replace the
  inline `except RecurrenceConflict as conflict: logger.warning +
  flash` block with `handle_recurrence_conflict(...)`.
- `app/routes/transfers.py::update_transfer_template` -- same two
  replacements with `noun="recurring transfer"` and the matching
  redirect endpoint.
- `tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_form_helpers.py` -- add
  helper unit tests for both new helpers covering the happy
  path, the noun substitution, and (for `handle_stale_form_conflict`)
  the log message including both submitted and current counters.

**D. Implementation approach**

1. Read the cited pre-existing blocks in
   `app/routes/templates.py:319-339` and `:418-431`, and
   `app/routes/transfers.py:338-355` and `:430-443`, in full.
   Confirm the bodies match the pylint output (each line is what
   the helper will replace).
2. Read the existing F-24 helper module
   `app/routes/_recurrence_form_helpers.py` end-to-end to confirm
   the module's import style, naming conventions, and the
   STALE_*_MESSAGE template pattern.  Mirror the same style for
   the two new helpers.
3. Add to `_recurrence_form_helpers.py`:
   ```python
   _RECURRENCE_CONFLICT_FLASH: str = (
       "Note: {overridden_count} overridden and "
       "{deleted_count} deleted entries were kept as-is."
   )

   def handle_stale_form_conflict(
       *,
       logger: logging.Logger,
       log_label: str,
       log_id: int,
       submitted: int,
       current: int,
       flash_message: str,
       redirect_endpoint: str,
       redirect_endpoint_kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
   ) -> Response:
       """Optimistic-locking pre-flush form-side conflict handler.

           "Stale-form conflict on %s id=%d "
           "(submitted=%d, current=%d)",

       behaviour.

   (Adjust the `conflict.template_id` access to whatever attribute

   the caller pass `log_id` explicitly via a keyword.  Re-read
   the exception class before writing the helper body.)
4. Refactor `app/routes/templates.py::update_template` at the
   `submitted_version` pop:
   ```python
   submitted_version = data.pop("version_id", None)
   if (submitted_version is not None
           and submitted_version != template.version_id):
       return handle_stale_form_conflict(
           logger=logger,
           log_label="update_template",
           log_id=template_id,
           submitted=submitted_version,
           current=template.version_id,
           flash_message=STALE_EDITING_MESSAGE.format(
               noun="recurring transaction",
           ),
           redirect_endpoint="templates.edit_template",
           redirect_endpoint_kwargs={"template_id": template_id},
       )
   ```
5. Refactor the `except RecurrenceConflict` block:
   ```python
   except RecurrenceConflict as conflict:
       handle_recurrence_conflict(
           logger=logger,
           noun="recurring transaction",
           conflict=conflict,
       )
   ```
6. Mirror in `app/routes/transfers.py::update_transfer_template`
   with `noun="recurring transfer"`, the matching redirect
   endpoint, and the same call-site shape.
7. Add unit tests in
   `tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_form_helpers.py` for both
   helpers; pin the log message format and the flash wording.
   Use the same "real endpoint name, no app.add_url_rule"
   pattern Commit 2's tests established (the session-scoped
   `app` fixture is frozen by the time these tests run).

**E. Test cases**

The two pairs being closed have integration coverage via the
existing `tests/test_routes/test_templates.py` and
`tests/test_routes/test_transfers.py` update-route tests; new
unit tests pin helper-internal contracts.

- C3-1 `handle_stale_form_conflict` logs at INFO with both
  submitted and current counters present in the message, flashes
  the caller-supplied string, and returns a 302 Response.
- C3-2 `handle_recurrence_conflict` logs at WARNING with the
  noun and counts in the message, flashes the canonical
  formatted string with the substituted counts, and returns
  `None`.
- C3-3 the existing `test_update_template_stale_version_mismatch`
  / `test_update_transfer_template_stale_version_mismatch`
  integration tests pass unchanged (the refactor is byte-
  equivalent at the wire level).
- C3-4 the existing
  `test_update_template_recurrence_conflict_auto_keep` /
  transfer-side analogue (read tests/test_routes/test_templates.py
  and test_transfers.py to confirm the exact name) pass
  unchanged.
- C3-5 `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0801 app/routes/templates.py
  app/routes/transfers.py` shows no matches for F-26 pairs 1 and
  2.  Pairs 3-6 may still appear; they are deferred per Section
  9.

**F. Manual verification steps**

1. `grep -nF "handle_stale_form_conflict" app/routes/` returns
   matches in `templates.py`, `transfers.py`, and the helper
   module; two call sites total (one per update route).
2. `grep -nF "handle_recurrence_conflict" app/routes/` returns
   matches in the same three files; two call sites total.
3. `grep -nF "_RECURRENCE_CONFLICT_FLASH" app/` returns one match
   (the helper module).
4. `grep -nE "submitted_version is not None and submitted_version
   != template.version_id" app/routes/templates.py
   app/routes/transfers.py` returns one match per file -- each
   followed by the `return handle_stale_form_conflict(...)`
   call.
5. Start the dev server.  Open a transaction template's edit form
   in two browser tabs.  Save the first.  Save the second --
   the canonical stale-form flash should appear and the user is
   redirected back to the edit form.  Repeat for a transfer
   template.

**G. Downstream effects** Future templates / transfers update
routes (or any other route that needs the optimistic-locking
form-side guard or the RecurrenceConflict advisory) inherit two
well-tested helpers.  The two flash-template strings are
centralised at the helper module so a future copy edit lives in
one place.

**H. Rollback notes** `git revert`.  Both helpers are additive
to the F-24 module; the inlined bodies can be restored verbatim
from history per route.  No schema change, no behavioural change
at the wire level; rollback is safe at any point.

### Commit 4 -- F-24 / F-25 / F-26 follow-up final gate

**A. Commit message** `chore(release): F-24/F-25/F-26 follow-up final gate`

**B. Problem statement** Acceptance gate for the F-24 / F-25 /
F-26 follow-up.  Confirms all three implementation commits landed
cleanly, the full suite is green, pylint is clean and the
targeted R0401 / R0801 warnings each commit closes are gone, and
the documented status of all three findings is updated (F-26's
status records the partition: pairs 1-2 closed, pairs 3-6
deferred per Section 9).  No code changes.

**C. Files modified**

- `docs/audits/financial_calculations/remediation_follow_up.md` --
  update three `**Status:**` lines:
  - F-24: "resolved by Commit 2 of
    `remediation_follow_up_F24_F25_F26_plan.md`."
  - F-25: "resolved by Commit 1 of
    `remediation_follow_up_F24_F25_F26_plan.md`."
  - F-26: "partially resolved by Commit 3 of
    `remediation_follow_up_F24_F25_F26_plan.md` (pairs 1 and 2,
    the stale-form check and RecurrenceConflict flash); pairs
    3-6 (list-rendering shapes, hard-delete archive-fallback
    body wrapping) explicitly deferred per Section 9."

**D. Implementation approach (gate checklist -- all must pass before this commit)**

Per `remediation_follow_up_common.md` "Apply these rules (every
commit)" plus the additions in this plan's Section 1:

1. `python scripts/build_test_template.py` -- NOT required (no
   migration in this plan), but run it anyway if
   `app/ref_seeds.py` or `app/audit_infrastructure.py` was
   touched.  Confirm by `git log --name-only origin/dev..HEAD`
   showing neither file.
2. `./scripts/test.sh` -- ends in `N passed`, zero
   failed/errors/xfailed.  Capture the final summary line and
   include it in the commit body and section E of the work
   summary.
3. `pylint app/ --fail-on=E,F` -- clean, no new warnings vs the
   post-Commit-22 (head `a0782f7`) baseline (`9.57/10`).  The
   targeted R0401 and R0801 warnings are gone:
   - `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0401 app/` shows no matches
     rooted in `app/routes/accounts/` or
     `app/utils/account_validation.py` (F-25 acceptance).
   - `pylint --disable=all --enable=R0801 app/routes/templates.py
     app/routes/transfers.py` shows no matches for any of:
     - The nine F-24 pre-extraction pairs (the existing-rule
       mutation branch may still show -- accepted per Section
       2).
     - The two F-26 pairs Commit 3 closed (stale-form check,
       RecurrenceConflict flash).
     Pylint MAY still report R0801 for the four F-26 pairs
     deferred per Section 9 (list-rendering pairs 3-5, hard-
     delete archive-fallback pair 6) and for the new helper-
     call-site duplicates from F-24 (the inherent trade-off of
     shared helpers across two routes).  The gate explicitly
     tolerates these.
4. No migrations -- step skipped.
5. The existing static guards from prior chains (cross-page
   balance lock, ARM-window stability lock, F-6 grid/accounts
   guards, C8-5 static guard) all green.  The C8-5 guard is
   the most relevant here because Commit 1 of this plan touches
   the accounts package; verify
   `tests/test_services/test_year_end_summary_service.py::test_no_external_calculate_balances_callers`
   still passes after the package restructure.  The new helper
   unit tests in
   `tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_form_helpers.py` -- both
   the F-24 set and the F-26 additions -- are green.
6. Sweep `remediation_follow_up.md`: update F-24, F-25, and
   F-26 `**Status:**` lines per Section C above.  F-26's status
   records the partition explicitly (pairs 1-2 closed; pairs
   3-6 deferred).
7. `git status` shows only the docs file changed (this commit
   is gate + bookkeeping).

**E. Test cases** The entire suite is the test case.  Acceptance:
full green suite, clean pylint with the targeted warnings gone,
the documented status of F-24, F-25, and F-26 updated.

**F. Manual verification steps**

1. Walk the affected route surfaces in the dev server:
   - Visit `/accounts`, click into a checking account, edit an
     anchor, edit an account, create / delete an account type
     (F-25 acceptance).
   - Create a recurring transaction template; edit it; archive /
     unarchive / hard-delete it.  Same flow for a transfer
     template (F-24 acceptance, every helper call site
     exercised).
   - Open a transaction template's edit form in two browser
     tabs; save the first; save the second -- the canonical
     stale-form flash should appear and the user redirects back
     to the edit form (F-26 pair 1 acceptance).
2. Confirm `remediation_follow_up.md` shows F-24, F-25, and
   F-26 with their post-gate statuses.  F-26's status explicitly
   names the four deferred pairs so future readers know the
   entry is partial-closed by design.

**G. Downstream effects** All three follow-up entries are
closed (F-26 partially per Section 9).  The project's pylint
output no longer carries the four R0401 cyclic-import warnings,
the nine R0801 templates/transfers F-24 duplicates, or the two
F-26 duplicates Commit 3 closed; genuine future regressions in
any of those areas surface as new offenders rather than as
additions to known-accepted noise.  Four F-26 R0801 pairs (3-6)
remain as known-tolerated debt, named in Section 9 with
acceptance criteria for the eventual cleanup PR.

**H. Rollback notes** No code change in this commit; revert
only the docs file if any step in the gate fails on rebuild.

---

## 8. End-to-end verification (no user-visible symptoms)

None of F-24, F-25, or F-26 fixes a user-visible defect.  All
three close pylint warnings that the main remediation chain
accepted as known-tolerated at the time.  The verification surface
is therefore:

1. **Pylint targeted warnings gone.** The four R0401 in
   `accounts/` are no longer reported (F-25); the nine R0801
   between templates.py and transfers.py for the three F-24-named
   pairs plus the six wider stale-conflict variations are no
   longer reported (F-24); the two F-26 pairs Commit 3 closed
   (stale-form check, RecurrenceConflict flash) are no longer
   reported.  The four deferred F-26 pairs (3-6) and the new
   helper-call-site duplicates from F-24 / F-26 are explicitly
   tolerated by the gate per Commit 4 D-3 and Section 9.
2. **Pylint score baseline preserved or improved.** The post-
   Commit-22 baseline is `9.57/10`.  Any of the three
   implementation commits may bump the score marginally; none
   should drop it.  F-24 already lifted the baseline to `9.58`;
   Commit 3 (F-26) is expected to hold or improve from there.
3. **Behaviour unchanged.** Every existing route test
   (`tests/test_routes/test_accounts.py`,
   `tests/test_routes/test_templates.py`,
   `tests/test_routes/test_transfers.py`) passes without
   modification; this is the load-bearing assertion that all
   three refactors are byte-equivalent at the wire level.  The
   pre-existing
   `test_update_template_stale_version_mismatch` and
   `test_update_transfer_template_stale_version_mismatch`
   integration tests in particular cover the F-26 pair 1
   refactor; their continued green is C3-3 acceptance.
4. **New helper-unit tests pass.** Commit 2's
   `tests/test_routes/test_recurrence_form_helpers.py` pins both
   F-24 helpers' internal contracts; Commit 3 adds two more
   test classes to the same file pinning the F-26 helpers
   (`handle_stale_form_conflict` and `handle_recurrence_conflict`).
   Future edits to any of the four helpers surface failures at
   the unit-test layer rather than as integration drift.

## 9. Out-of-scope items flagged during planning

Discovered during verification or while drafting commits; deliberately
NOT included in this plan. The developer chooses whether to promote
any of them later.

- **R0801 on the update-path existing-rule mutation branch.**
  Commit 2's helper covers the "construct fresh rule" branch only;
  the "mutate existing rule" branch (`if template.recurrence_rule:
  template.recurrence_rule.pattern_id = pattern.id; ...`) still
  matches as R0801 between templates.py and transfers.py. Extracting
  it would replace nine lines of `setattr`-style assignments with a
  helper whose body is identical to the inline form -- no
  abstraction value, just one more indirection. Acceptable as-is;
  Section 2 explicitly records the choice.

- **F-26 pairs 3-5 (list-rendering shapes).**
  `templates.py:[133:147]` vs `transfers.py:[105:112]`;
  `templates.py:[251:257]` vs `transfers.py:[106:112]`;
  `templates.py:[141:147]` vs `transfers.py:[753:759]`.  The
  "load active + archived templates, partition into two lists,
  render the list page" pattern repeats with one route-specific
  axis (model class) plus a different render-template path per
  caller.  Closing all three would require a list-rendering
  helper or a class-based view -- a different abstraction than
  the four small Flask-aware helpers F-24 and F-26 establish.
  Not worth the design discussion or the blast radius for the
  templates / transfers pair alone; revisit if a third CRUD
  module (e.g. a future scheduled-action templates) joins the
  pattern.

- **F-26 pair 6 (hard-delete archive-fallback body wrapping).**
  `templates.py:[577:587]` vs `transfers.py:[629:640]`.  F-24
  closed the inner `try/except StaleDataError` via
  `handle_stale_conflict`, but the surrounding "`if template.is_active:
  template.is_active = False; <soft-delete projected rows via
  model-specific query>; try: db.session.commit() ...`" structure
  remains duplicated.  Closing it would require a shared archive
  helper that takes a model-specific soft-delete callable -- the
  templates side soft-deletes via a bare `db.session.query(...).update(...)`,
  the transfers side delegates per-row to
  `transfer_service.delete_transfer` to maintain shadow invariants.
  Design discussion warranted before any extraction.  Deferred
  with an acceptance criterion in `remediation_follow_up.md::F-26`
  for the eventual cleanup PR.

- **Other R0801 across `app/routes/`.** A whole-repo R0801 run may
  surface duplicates outside templates/transfers (e.g. the FK-
  ownership check loops in transfers.py and the accounts package).
  Out of scope for F-24 and F-26, both of which name templates/transfers
  specifically.  If a future audit finds equivalent duplications
  elsewhere, they warrant their own follow-up entry.

- **`accounts_bp` rename or splitting into per-sub-domain
  blueprints.** Commit 21 (F-1) explicitly locked Option A
  (single blueprint, file-split). F-25 inherits that constraint;
  going to per-sub-domain blueprints would require updating every
  `url_for("accounts.X")` call site and is a separate design
  question.

- **Service-layer home for `build_recurrence_rule_from_form`.** The
  helper is pure-data (could live in `app/services/recurrence_engine.py`),
  but its sibling `handle_stale_conflict` is Flask-tied. Co-locating
  both in a route-layer helper module is the pragmatic call. If a
  service-layer caller appears for the data-only helper, moving it
  to a service module is mechanical.

These are **suggestions**, not commitments. Mention to the developer
at plan-presentation time and let them choose to promote any to a
follow-up commit.

## 10. Notes on executing this plan

- Run commits in order; Section 6's order is reviewer-attention
  optimisation for F-25 vs F-24 (no technical dependency), but
  Commit 3 has a real dependency on Commit 2 (extends the F-24
  helper module).  Landing F-25 first keeps the F-24 diff focused
  on the helper extraction without noise from the accounts-
  package restructure; landing F-26 after F-24 means the F-26
  call-site refactor touches the post-F-24 shape of the update
  routes, avoiding a rebase.
- Every commit: re-grep cited lines first, targeted tests during,
  `pylint app/ --fail-on=E,F` plus the targeted R0401 / R0801
  runs, then the full suite as the per-commit final gate and the
  plan-final gate (Commit 4).
- None of the three implementation commits modifies tests to make
  them pass.  If any existing test fails after any commit, the
  refactor introduced a semantic drift -- the code is wrong, not
  the test.
- No migrations; no destructive changes; all three commits are
  pure refactors with additive helper modules.
- This plan is a remediation plan only.  No code is changed by
  producing it.  Execution happens in separate sessions, one
  commit (or small group) per session, suite green before moving
  on.
- After Commit 4 lands, F-24, F-25 are fully closed and F-26 is
  partially closed (pairs 1-2 closed by Commit 3; pairs 3-6
  explicitly deferred per Section 9 with acceptance criteria
  recorded in `remediation_follow_up.md::F-26` for the eventual
  cleanup PR).  The existing F-N entries that were closed by the
  first follow-up plan stay marked resolved; F-24, F-25, and
  F-26 entries are marked resolved (or partially resolved)
  by this plan's Commits 2, 1, and 3 respectively.

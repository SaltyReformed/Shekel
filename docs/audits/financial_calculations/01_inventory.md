## Controlled vocabulary

Tokens from Appendix A (section 12) of the audit plan plus additions made during Phase 1. Every
token carries a one-sentence definition naming the value produced and its units (Decimal money,
integer count, percentage, date). The definitions describe what the value IS, not which function
computes it; producer/consumer lists live in section 1.7.3.

Appendix A starter set (42 tokens):

- `checking_balance` -- Decimal dollar balance of a checking account at a specific pay-period anchor
  or at the end of a specific pay period; the "spendable balance" for budgeting decisions.
- `account_balance` -- Decimal dollar balance of any account (checking, savings, loan, investment)
  at a specific pay period; superset of `checking_balance`.
- `projected_end_balance` -- Decimal dollar balance of an account projected to the end of a
  non-current pay period via the balance calculator.
- `period_subtotal` -- Decimal dollar sum of transactions in one pay period, partitioned into
  income, expense, and net components.
- `loan_principal_real` -- Decimal dollar outstanding principal of a loan derived from the
  engine-walked schedule (fixed-rate per A-04) or from the stored anchor (ARM per A-04); the value
  the audit treats as authoritative for projection.
- `loan_principal_stored` -- Decimal dollar value of `LoanParams.current_principal` as persisted in
  the DB; AUTHORITATIVE for ARM per A-04, otherwise a snapshot for display.
- `loan_principal_displayed` -- (orphan; see 1.7.2.) Reserved by Appendix A for any third
  loan-principal flavor distinct from `_real` or `_stored`; no body site uses it.
- `monthly_payment` -- Decimal dollar value of a loan's amortized monthly payment derived from
  `(current_principal, current_rate, remaining_months)` via the standard formula; stable within an
  ARM's fixed-rate window per E-02.
- `principal_paid_per_period` -- Decimal dollar principal portion of one period's loan payment
  derived from the schedule.
- `interest_paid_per_period` -- Decimal dollar interest portion of one period's loan payment derived
  from the schedule.
- `escrow_per_period` -- Decimal dollar escrow component of one period's loan payment, summed from
  active EscrowComponents and optionally inflated.
- `payoff_date` -- Calendar date (Python `date`) on which a loan's outstanding principal reaches
  zero under the projected schedule.
- `months_saved` -- Integer count of months a payoff is accelerated relative to the contractual
  schedule under a specified extra-payment plan.
- `total_interest` -- Decimal dollar sum of all interest paid over the life of a loan (or over the
  year, for year-end summaries).
- `interest_saved` -- Decimal dollar difference between contractual lifetime interest and
  accelerated lifetime interest under a specified extra-payment or refinance plan.
- `apy_interest` -- Decimal dollar interest accrued on an interest-bearing account over one pay
  period using actual/365 daily/monthly/quarterly compounding
  (`interest_projection.calculate_interest`).
- `growth` -- Decimal-fraction or Decimal dollar value representing a growth, inflation, or trend
  rate (e.g., investment return rate, raise percentage, escrow inflation, trend-alert threshold);
  units vary by sub-concept and are documented per producer.
- `employer_contribution` -- Decimal dollar amount of employer 401(k) match for one pay period
  derived from flat-percentage or match-percentage plus cap rules.
- `contribution_limit_remaining` -- Decimal dollar amount of annual 401(k) contribution headroom
  remaining (`limit - YTD`) at a specific point in the calendar year.
- `ytd_contributions` -- Decimal dollar year-to-date employee 401(k) contribution total at a
  specific point in the calendar year.
- `paycheck_gross` -- Decimal dollar gross wage for one pay period after raises and before
  deductions/taxes.
- `paycheck_net` -- Decimal dollar net (take-home) wage for one pay period after taxes and all
  deductions.
- `taxable_income` -- Decimal dollar income subject to federal/state income tax after pre-tax
  deductions and standard deduction.
- `federal_tax` -- Decimal dollar federal income tax withheld for one pay period via the IRS Pub
  15-T Percentage Method.
- `state_tax` -- Decimal dollar state income tax withheld for one pay period via the configured flat
  rate (or zero for no-tax states).
- `fica` -- Decimal dollar Social Security + Medicare withholding for one pay period (with
  cumulative-wage cap for SS and threshold-based surtax for Medicare).
- `pre_tax_deduction` -- Decimal dollar pre-tax payroll deduction (e.g., 401(k), pre-tax insurance)
  for one pay period.
- `post_tax_deduction` -- Decimal dollar post-tax payroll deduction (e.g., Roth 401(k), post-tax
  insurance) for one pay period.
- `transfer_amount` -- Decimal dollar amount of a stored `Transfer.amount`; the canonical value
  mirrored to both shadow transactions per Transfer Invariant 3.
- `effective_amount` -- Decimal dollar amount used in balance computation: returns `Decimal("0")`
  for soft-deleted or status-excluded transactions, else `actual_amount` if non-null, else
  `estimated_amount` (`Transaction.effective_amount` property; `Transfer.effective_amount` is the
  simpler transfer variant).
- `goal_progress` -- Decimal-fraction or Decimal-percent value representing how close a savings goal
  is to its target (`current_balance / target_amount`).
- `emergency_fund_coverage_months` -- Decimal-fraction count of months of average monthly expenses
  an emergency-fund balance covers (`savings_balance / avg_monthly_expenses`).
- `dti_ratio` -- Decimal-fraction debt-to-income ratio
  (`total_monthly_debt_payments / gross_monthly_income`).
- `net_worth` -- Decimal dollar `(sum of asset balances) - (sum of debt balances)` at a specific
  date.
- `savings_total` -- Decimal dollar sum of all savings and investment account balances (excludes
  checking and debt).
- `debt_total` -- Decimal dollar sum of all liability/debt account balances.
- `chart_balance_series` -- List of Decimal dollar balance values aligned to `chart_date_labels`;
  the per-period or per-month data points a chart renders.
- `year_summary_jan1_balance` -- Decimal dollar account balance on January 1 of the configured
  calendar year (year-end summary).
- `year_summary_dec31_balance` -- Decimal dollar account balance on December 31 of the configured
  calendar year (year-end summary).
- `year_summary_principal_paid` -- Decimal dollar sum of principal paid down on a debt account over
  the configured calendar year.
- `year_summary_growth` -- Decimal dollar sum of growth (interest accrued or investment-return
  growth) on a savings/investment account over the configured calendar year.
- `year_summary_employer_total` -- Decimal dollar sum of employer contributions deposited to an
  investment account over the configured calendar year.

P1-b additions (4 tokens; first introduced in section 1.1 -- citations in 1.7.2):

- `pension_benefit_annual` -- Decimal dollar annual defined-benefit pension amount
  (`pension_calculator.calculate_benefit`).
- `pension_benefit_monthly` -- Decimal dollar monthly defined-benefit pension amount =
  `pension_benefit_annual / 12`.
- `loan_remaining_months` -- Integer count of months until a loan's contractual maturity from the
  current date.
- `cash_runway_days` -- Integer count of days a current checking balance covers at the
  trailing-30-day daily average of paid expenses.

P1-c additions (5 tokens; first introduced in section 1.2 -- citations in 1.7.2):

- `entry_sum_total` -- Decimal dollar sum of `TransactionEntry.amount` for a transaction (cleared +
  uncleared, with credit and debit partition available).
- `entry_remaining` -- Decimal dollar value `estimated_amount - sum(entries)` for an entry-tracked
  transaction; negative = overspent.
- `paycheck_breakdown` -- Bundle of
  `paycheck_gross + paycheck_net + federal_tax + state_tax + fica + pre_tax_deduction + post_tax_deduction + employer_contribution`
  returned as a `PaycheckBreakdown` dataclass; single render unit at the salary breakdown /
  projection / list pages.
- `chart_date_labels` -- List of human-readable date strings (e.g. "May 2026") rendered alongside
  `chart_balance_series` as chart x-axis labels; presentation-only formatting of period start_date.
- `transfer_amount_computed` -- Decimal dollar route-derived pre-fill value for a new recurring
  payment-transfer Transfer (loan: P&I+escrow; investment: limit/26 with $500 fallback); distinct
  from `transfer_amount` (stored) because the user can override before submit.

The raw list below is kept for tooling that greps by token name; the authoritative definitions are
above. The orphan `loan_principal_displayed` is retained in the list per the audit plan rule that
Appendix A's starter set defines the contract, even when a token is currently unused.

Additions during 1.5 (none). The starter set covers every numeric column in `app/models/`. Some
columns (rate inputs, inflation, calibration effective rates) map onto a downstream concept token
rather than a column-level token; this is noted in the per-column rows.

Additions during 1.1 (P1-b, 2026-05-15):

- `pension_benefit_annual` -- annual defined-benefit pension amount
  produced by `pension_calculator.calculate_benefit` at
  `app/services/pension_calculator.py:31-66` (`PensionBenefit.annual_benefit`
  field on the returned dataclass). The starter vocabulary lacked a
  pension-specific token; required for Phase 2 catalog entry.
- `pension_benefit_monthly` -- monthly defined-benefit pension amount
  produced at `app/services/pension_calculator.py:65-66` and consumed by
  `retirement_dashboard_service.compute_gap_data` and
  `retirement_gap_calculator.calculate_gap` as the
  `monthly_pension_income` argument
  (`app/services/retirement_gap_calculator.py:39`).
- `loan_remaining_months` -- count of unfulfilled loan months returned
  by `amortization_engine.calculate_remaining_months` at
  `app/services/amortization_engine.py:128-176`. Distinct from
  `payoff_date` (the calendar date) because consumers display the
  integer count separately. Used as an input to
  `calculate_monthly_payment` at the same module.
- `cash_runway_days` -- integer days of runway computed by
  `dashboard_service._compute_cash_runway` at
  `app/services/dashboard_service.py:375` (current_balance divided by
  daily-average paid expenses from a 30-day window). Distinct from
  `emergency_fund_coverage_months` because the inputs and time unit
  differ. Phase 2 must decide whether to fold this into
  `emergency_fund_coverage_months` or keep them separate.

Additions during 1.2 (P1-c, 2026-05-15):

- `entry_sum_total` -- per-transaction sum of cleared+uncleared entries
  produced for tracked transactions by `entry_service.compute_entry_sums`
  (returned as a dict per `entries.py:_render_entry_list`,
  `companion.py:_build_entry_data` at lines 50-57, and consumed in the grid
  via `build_entry_sums_dict` at `transactions.py:88`). Distinct from
  `effective_amount` because entries are the user-facing inputs that feed
  the `effective_amount` computation on the Transaction model.
- `entry_remaining` -- per-transaction remaining budget computed by
  `entry_service.compute_remaining(estimated_amount, entries)` (cited in
  `entries.py:104-106` and `companion.py:52`). Anchors the
  "remaining budget" display on cells; Phase 3 will compare against
  `effective_amount` semantics.
- `paycheck_breakdown` -- `PaycheckBreakdown` dataclass produced by
  `paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck` (see section 1.1) and rendered
  on the salary breakdown / projection / list pages. Single-token shorthand
  for the bundle `paycheck_gross + paycheck_net + federal_tax + state_tax
  - fica + pre_tax_deduction + post_tax_deduction + employer_contribution`;
  the route layer treats the breakdown as one rendered unit, so the audit needs a single token to
  track it across pages.
- `chart_date_labels` -- string-formatted date labels (e.g. "May 2026")
  emitted by `investment.dashboard` (`app/routes/investment.py:242-246`),
  `investment.growth_chart` (`:534`), and the loan chart helper at
  `loan.py:460`. Display-only formatting of period start_date but is
  rendered next to `chart_balance_series`, so the audit tracks it
  separately to flag any divergence between the two parallel arrays.
- `transfer_amount_computed` -- the route-derived transfer amount for new
  recurring payment transfers (loan and investment routes). Distinct from
  `transfer_amount` (which describes Transfer.amount as stored): the
  computed flavor is the route's pre-fill value that defaults to a
  derived monthly payment when the user does not override; cited at
  `loan.py:1213-1241` and `investment.py:668-670`. Phase 3 compares the
  computed flavor against the stored amount.

## 1.5 Models and computed properties

24 model files read in full (P1-a, Explore subagent, very thorough). 40 classes inventoried, 113
numeric columns, 6 `@property` accessors. NO `@hybrid_property` or `@cached_property` in scope.

For each row, the "Concept token" column gives the financial concept the column or property feeds.
Non-financial columns (sort orders, version counters, period indexes, dependent counts, FICA
day-counts) are recorded as `-` so the inventory is exhaustive across numeric columns; Phase 6's
SOLID audit needs the full surface.

CHECK constraint citations are line numbers in the same model file where `db.CheckConstraint(...)`
appears inside `__table_args__`. When a constraint exists in a migration but not in the model file,
the cell reads `MIGRATION (not in model)`. The rebuild migration
(`migrations/versions/a5be2a99ea14_rebuild_audit_infrastructure.py`) is the canonical source for
audit-trigger attachment but is not a CHECK source for these columns.

### `app/models/calibration_override.py`

| CalibrationDeductionOverride.actual_amount | calibration_override.py:164 | Numeric(10, 2) | False | - | calibration_override.py:136 | pre_tax_deduction |

The four Numeric(10, 2) money columns deviate from the `Numeric(12, 2)` project standard (E-14).
Flag for Phase 6 DRY/SOLID: precision drift on calibration tables, which were added later than the
canonical money columns. Whether 10,2 is correct (calibration values are bounded by a single
paycheck) or whether the standard should be enforced uniformly is a Phase 6 question, not a 1.5
finding.

### `app/models/loan_features.py`

144 lines. Classes: `RateHistory`, `EscrowComponent`.

Numeric columns:

`RateHistory.interest_rate` is the ARM-anchor source flagged by C-04 in the priors; Phase 3 must
compare which entry points consume RateHistory versus the static `LoanParams.interest_rate`.

Computed properties: none.

### `app/models/loan_params.py`

74 lines. Classes: `LoanParams`.

Numeric columns:

| Class.column | file:line | SQLAlchemy type | Nullable | Server default | CHECK constraint | Concept token |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LoanParams.payment_day | loan_params.py:58 | Integer | False | - | loan_params.py:24 | - |

| LoanParams.arm_adjustment_interval_months | loan_params.py:61 | Integer | True | - | - | - |

`LoanParams.current_principal` is the source-of-truth column flagged by C-03/C-04 in the priors and
by E-03 in the developer expectations. Phase 4 (source-of-truth audit) is the dedicated spot for
this column. A-04 (09_open_questions.md:93-103) resolves the C-03/C-04 ARM-vs-fixed-rate split: ARM
loans use stored `current_principal` directly (`amortization_engine.py:977-985`,
`savings_dashboard_service.py:373`, `year_end_summary_service.py:1465-1469`); fixed-rate loans walk
the schedule from origination using confirmed `PaymentRecord` rows. The column is therefore
AUTHORITATIVE for ARM and CACHED-for-display for fixed-rate; Phase 4 records the dual
classification.

`LoanParams.interest_rate` (line 55) is the static rate; ARM loans override it via
`RateHistory.interest_rate` (`loan_features.py:75`). A-05 (09_open_questions.md:113-125) confirms
the eight call sites that compute ARM monthly_payment from
`(current_principal, current_rate, remaining_months)`; Phase 3 must verify all eight sites resolve
`current_rate` against the same authority for the same loan-on-date.

Computed properties: none.

### `app/models/mixins.py`

103 lines. Classes: `TimestampMixin`, `CreatedAtMixin`, `SoftDeleteOverridableMixin`. No numeric
columns or computed numeric properties of audit interest.

### `app/models/pay_period.py`

50 lines. Classes: `PayPeriod`.

Numeric columns:

### `app/models/paycheck_deduction.py`

154 lines. Classes: `PaycheckDeduction`.

Numeric columns:

| PaycheckDeduction.version_id | paycheck_deduction.py:139 | Integer | False | "1" | paycheck_deduction.py:66 | - |

`PaycheckDeduction.amount` is `Numeric(12, 4)` (sub-cent precision), unlike the canonical
`Numeric(12, 2)`. The wider precision lets the paycheck calculator carry intermediate rounding
before quantizing the displayed paycheck. Phase 3 confirms: every consumer reads through the
calculator and quantizes at the boundary, not at the column.

Computed properties: none.

Computed properties: none. Pension calculation logic lives in `app/services/pension_calculator.py`;
this model only persists the input parameters.

`Transaction.effective_amount` is the load-bearing entry point for balance computation. The 4-tier
branching means a Phase 3 consistency audit must compare (a) every site that reads
`effective_amount`, (b) every site that reads `actual_amount` directly, (c) every site that reads
`estimated_amount` directly, and (d) every site that filters by status before summing. Direct reads
of `actual_amount` or `estimated_amount` bypass tier 1 (is_deleted) and tier 2 (status exclusion);
sites that do this on purpose must be intentional, and sites that do this by accident are findings.

`is_income` / `is_expense` use `ref_cache.txn_type_id(...)` which is the ID-based lookup pattern
required by E-15 (no string `name` comparisons). This pair satisfies the standard.

NO `is_settled`, `is_done`, `is_received`, `is_credit`, `is_cancelled`, or `is_projected` properties
exist on `Transaction`. Status checks must go through `status.is_settled` /
`status.excludes_from_balance` (boolean columns on the `Status` ref row). This means consumers
either read the whole `Status` object or call into a service helper; section 1.1 inventories which
path each site uses.

`TransactionEntry.amount` is the column aggregated by the only two money SQL aggregates

| Transfer.effective_amount | transfer.py:174-182 | @property | Decimal (inferred) | `Decimal("0") if status.excludes_from_balance else amount` | status.excludes_from_balance, amount | transfer_amount |

`Transfer.effective_amount` simpler than `Transaction.effective_amount`: no actual/estimated split,
no soft-delete branch (transfers route soft-deletion through cascade to shadow transactions per
E-08, so queries excluded soft-deleted parents should not reach this property in balance contexts).
E-09 forbids the balance calculator from querying the `transfers` table at all; this property is
reserved for the transfer service and CRUD/display sites.

`UserSettings.trend_alert_threshold` is PA-01's open finding (Marshmallow `Range(min=1, max=100)`
percentage vs DB CHECK 0..1 decimal). `UserSettings.safe_withdrawal_rate` is the column behind
PA-04's float-cast violation in `compute_slider_defaults`.
`UserSettings.estimated_retirement_tax_rate` is one of the rate fields inspected by PA-02. These
three columns are inputs to financial calculations; the prior-audit findings live in section 0.6 of
`00_priors.md`.

`MfaConfig` numeric columns:

Computed properties on `User`, `UserSettings`, `MfaConfig`: none.

### Section 1.5 cross-cutting summary

- All money columns are `Numeric(12, 2)` except: calibration money
  (`Numeric(10, 2)`, four columns in `calibration_override.py`),
  paycheck deduction amount (`Numeric(12, 4)`, sub-cent precision for
  intermediate calculation), and savings-goal income multiplier
  (`Numeric(8, 2)`, multiplier not money). No `Float` money columns.
- All rate columns use `Numeric(7, 5)` (interest, APY, benefit
  multiplier) or `Numeric(5, 4)` (percentages, inflation, employer
  match caps, SWR, trend threshold). Calibration effective rates use
  `Numeric(12, 10)` for downstream-computation precision.
- Every money column has an in-model `CheckConstraint` EXCEPT the two
  `Account` balance columns (`Account.current_anchor_balance` line 51
  and `AccountAnchorHistory.anchor_balance` line 152), which carry no
  in-model CheckConstraint. Phase 4 confirms whether the migration
  attaches a CHECK or whether anchor balances are intentionally
  unbounded (mortgages can be negative balances, etc.).
- Six `@property` accessors total in `app/models/`. Five live on
  `Transaction`, one on `Transfer`, one on `Category` (display_name,
  not financial), one on `PayPeriod` (label, not financial). The
  financial properties are `Transaction.effective_amount`,
  `Transaction.is_income`, `Transaction.is_expense`, and
  `Transfer.effective_amount`; section 1.1 catalogues their consumers.
- No `@hybrid_property` or `@cached_property`. Stored-vs-computed
  drift detection (Phase 4) does not have a hybrid-property surface to
  worry about; the only stored numeric the audit must reconcile is
  `LoanParams.current_principal` against the amortization-engine
  replay (only for fixed-rate per A-04; AUTHORITATIVE for ARM), plus
  `Account.current_anchor_balance` against the balance calculator.
- A-01 (09_open_questions.md:29-35) establishes the canonical rounding
  rule `Decimal.quantize(Decimal("0.01"), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)` for
  any monetary calculation that produces a stored or displayed value.
  No model-layer column performs quantization (storage precision is
  fixed by the column type); the rounding rule applies to the service-
  layer code paths that compute values from these columns. Sections
  1.1 (services) through 1.4 (JS) inventory those quantization sites
  and Phase 3 verifies the rule is applied uniformly. The two sub-
  cent precision exceptions (`PaycheckDeduction.amount` Numeric(12, 4),
  `CalibrationOverride.effective_*_rate` Numeric(12, 10)) carry their
  precision through the calculator and quantize at the boundary; Phase
  3 confirms that boundary exists for every consumer.

## 1.6 Database queries that aggregate money

The grep `func\.sum|func\.avg|func\.min|func\.max|func\.count` over `app/` returns FIVE matches
(P1-a, 2026-05-15). The raw-SQL grep (`SUM(`, `AVG(`, `MIN(`, `MAX(`, `COUNT(` in .py files) returns
only the same five hits via `db.func.*`; no raw SQL strings with aggregate keywords exist outside
the SQLAlchemy `func` accessor. `db.text(...)` calls elsewhere are all column server defaults or
audit-infrastructure DDL, not aggregate execution paths. Python-builtin `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`
calls operate over already-fetched in-memory collections; they belong in section 1.1 (services) and
are out of scope for 1.6.

### Money aggregates: deeper notes

Both money aggregates live inside one function: `_compute_envelope_breakdowns_aware()` in
`app/services/year_end_summary_service.py`, called by the year-end summary service to break down
envelope-tracked spending by category group/item for the configured calendar year. The function:

- joins TransactionEntry to Transaction to TransactionTemplate to
  PayPeriod to Account, outer-joining Category (lines 530-540);
- restricts to user-owned, baseline-scenario, in-window, non-deleted,
  expense-typed, settled-status, envelope-template rows (lines 541-549);
- groups by category and individual transaction, retaining due_date and
  pay-period start_date for client-side year attribution
  (`row.due_date.year if row.due_date is not None else
  row.pp_start_date.year`, lines 562-565).

Neither aggregate filters on `entry_credit_workflow` flags directly; the credit-vs-debit distinction
is encoded entirely by the `case` in the second `func.sum`. Phase 3 must verify (a) that the
credit-entry exclusion is consistent with the entry-aware checking-impact formula in the balance
calculator (`app/services/balance_calculator.py:298-331`, per the docstring) and (b) that the same
envelope-spending concept computed elsewhere (spending trends, budget variance, savings dashboard)
uses the same filter set or documents the divergence.

### Aggregates over money outside services or in raw SQL

NONE. All five SQL aggregates are inside service modules. There are no SQL aggregates in routes,
templates, JS, raw SQL strings, or non-service code paths. This satisfies the audit-plan rule that
aggregates over money outside services are suspect.

### Filter-set checklist for the two money aggregates

For Phase 3 cross-comparison:

| Dimension | year_end_summary_service.py:519/520 |
| --- | --- |
| User scope | `Account.user_id == user_id` (line 542) |
| Scenario scope | `Transaction.scenario_id == scenario_id` (line 543) |
| Period scope | `Transaction.pay_period_id.in_(period_ids)` (line 544) |
| Soft delete | `Transaction.is_deleted.is_(False)` (line 545) |
| Type filter | `Transaction.transaction_type_id == expense_type_id` (line 546) |
| Status filter | `Transaction.status_id.in_(settled_status_ids)` (line 547) |
| Envelope filter | `TransactionTemplate.is_envelope.is_(True)` (line 548) |
| Effective-amount logic | Reads `TransactionEntry.amount` directly, not the entry-aware checking-impact formula. Justified because envelope entries are the source for envelope spending, but Phase 3 must confirm |
| Anchor handling | Not anchor-aware. Sums all entries in scope regardless of anchor period |
| `is_deleted` on TransactionEntry | NOT filtered. TransactionEntry has no soft-delete column per the model (`transaction_entry.py`); CASCADE from Transaction handles deletion |
| Quantization | None at the SQL layer. Caller is responsible for any rounding |
| Source-of-truth column | `TransactionEntry.amount` (line 73, Numeric(12, 2)) |

## Open questions raised in 1.5/1.6

None during this session. All numeric columns and properties mapped cleanly to existing
controlled-vocabulary tokens with the noted "input" qualifications. The classification ambiguities
flagged in this section (calibration money precision, savings goal multiplier precision, anchor-
balance lack of CHECK constraint, paycheck deduction Numeric(12, 4)) are recorded in the per-model
rows for Phase 6 (DRY/SOLID) to evaluate rather than as questions for the developer; they do not
block any calculation reading in subsequent Phase 1 sessions.

## 1.1 Service layer

40 files under `app/services/`. 18,022 LOC total. Three Explore subagents ran in parallel, very
thorough, each reading every file in scope IN FULL before producing the structured inventory. Files
were partitioned by domain (calculation engines / aggregation / transactional+workflow) to keep each
subagent's context bounded.

Out of scope per audit plan section 0.6 (auth and non-financial services excluded):
`auth_service.py` (805 lines), `mfa_service.py` (413 lines), `exceptions.py` (44 lines),
`__init__.py` (0 lines). Recorded for exhaustiveness but no functions inventoried.

In scope: 36 files, 16,760 LOC, 67+ public functions/methods.

For every public function in scope:

- one-sentence description of what the body actually does (not the
  docstring paraphrase);
- financial concept tokens produced (using the vocabulary at the top of
  this file);
- status filter, transaction-type filter, period scope, with file:line
  citations;
- amount column read (`effective_amount`, `actual_amount`,
  `estimated_amount`, `amount`) with file:line and a bypass flag;
- quantization site (precision, rounding mode, line) or "MISSING" per
  A-01;
- enumerated calls to other service functions or model methods.

The cross-cutting summary tables at the end of section 1.1 collect every `effective_amount` bypass,
every missing quantization, every Flask boundary import, every transfer-model read, and every
shadow-mutation site, so Phase 3 has a single grep target.

A-05 cross-reference: A-05 lists eight `calculate_monthly_payment` call sites; the grep finds
fourteen (`amortization_engine.py:436, 440, 491, 512, 693, 697, 952, 957`;
`balance_calculator.py:225, 231`; `loan_payment_service.py:251, 256`;
`app/routes/loan.py:1102, 1225, 1231`). The developer's list captures only the primary branch of
each call pair; Phase 3 must verify that adjacent fallback branches (lines 436, 693, 957 in the
engine; line 231 in the balance calculator; line 256 in loan_payment_service; lines 1102, 1231 in
the loan route) receive the same triple `(current_principal, current_rate, remaining_months)` for
the same loan-on-date as their primary siblings, per the A-05 invariant.

### Group A: Calculation engines

11 files inventoried in scope (`tax_config_service.py` is included for completeness despite
producing no money directly). Total 3,608 LOC. Zero Flask imports. Zero shadow mutations.
Quantization to `Decimal('0.01')` ROUND_HALF_UP is uniform per A-01 except where noted.

Phase 3 finding (no F-id yet): docstring at `tax_config_service.py:7` says it was "extracted from
the salary route to eliminate a route-to-route import and a duplicate copy in
`chart_data_service.py`". That file does not exist anywhere in `app/` (verified by grep); the audit
plan's required-grep list (Appendix B) includes `chart_data_service` and the only references in the
codebase are this stale docstring and a comment in `app/static/js/chart_theme.js:222`. Phase 3
should determine whether `chart_data_service` was renamed or never implemented.

`_sum_remaining` vs `_sum_all` differ only in name and which period(s) they receive; the body
filters, type splits, amount sources, and lack of quantization are identical. Phase 3 must compare
the two functions line-by-line to confirm no behavioral divergence has sneaked in (audit plan
section 3.1 calls this out explicitly).

**P1-f arithmetic re-verification (2026-05-15).** Source-read every row this
subsection presents as producing a financial concept via computation, applying
the P1-d classification rule table (arithmetic operators only; comparison,
selection, bare clamp/abs, `Decimal(str())` type-normalization, quantize, and
format do NOT count).

Conditional on financial value (NOT arithmetic -- Phase 3 must not treat these
as arithmetic producers; original table-row citations above are preserved):

- `dashboard_service.py:252` `_compute_alerts` -- the only financial touches
  are `bal < _ZERO` (line 298) and `current_bal < Decimal(str(low_threshold))`
  (line 314), both comparisons; the lone subtraction `date.today() -
  last_anchor.date()` (line 281) is non-financial date arithmetic. The
  account_balance / checking_balance tokens are consumed-and-compared, not
  produced. Concept-token producer attribution in 1.7.3 over-states this row.

Non-arithmetic, reads + delegates (no money operator):

- `dashboard_service.py:334` `_get_balance_info` -- `balance_results.get(...)`
  / `account.current_anchor_balance` reads plus `_compute_cash_runway`
  delegation; only a date comparison. Not a producer of checking_balance /
  cash_runway_days (it delegates the runway computation).

True-negative confirmed (was already framed as a read, no relocation needed):

- `dashboard_service.py:167` `txn_to_bill_dict` -- pure `txn.effective_amount`
  read (line 191) + non-financial `txn.due_date - today` (line 187) +
  `_entry_progress_fields` delegate; verified NOT arithmetic, consistent with
  the inventory's existing "effective_amount read" framing.

KEEP -- genuine arithmetic, re-verified at source: `:203`
`_entry_progress_fields` (`total = debit + credit`, line 238); `:375`
`_compute_cash_runway` (`sum(abs(...))` line 411, `current_balance /
daily_avg` lines 415-416).

`_compute_account_projections` line 373 against `balance_calculator.calculate_balances` results for
the same account on the same period, as A-04 and the developer's reported symptom #5 (`/accounts` vs

Borderline -- KEEP arithmetic, flag for Phase 3 adjudication:

- `retirement_dashboard_service.py:257` `compute_slider_defaults` -- genuine
  balance-weighted average (`total_balance += bal` line 323; `weighted_return
  += bal * params.assumed_annual_return` line 324; `weighted_return /
  total_balance` line 327), so it stays classified as arithmetic. FLAG: the
  `settings.safe_withdrawal_rate * _PCT_SCALE` (line 307) and `... *
  _PCT_SCALE` (line 327) are rate-to-percentage **presentation** conversions
  (0.04 -> 4.00), exactly the "percentage-to-rate displays" family named in
  caveat 1.7.6 (1). Phase 3 adjudicates whether presentation-only percentage
  scaling is in-scope financial arithmetic.

  `Decimal(str())` type-normalization of a stored column under a conditional;
  no arithmetic operator. It is the A-04 ARM-anchor read (already a YES in the

  loan_principal_stored. Phase 3 must not treat it as arithmetic.

Citation-quality fixes (caveat 1.7.6 (2) fold-in; line numbers themselves are
accurate -- the drift is in function attribution / range precision):

- The `1465-1469` ARM anchor is enclosed by `_generate_debt_schedules` (def
  at line 1421), NOT `_balance_from_schedule_at_date` as stated in this
  subsection's `| 1465-1469 |` row and in the cross-cutting bypass table
  (`year_end_summary_service.py:1465-1469`). Trust the line numbers; the
  enclosing-function name is wrong.
- `:518-528` -- the two money SQL aggregates are precisely line 519
  (`db.func.sum(TransactionEntry.amount)`) and 520-528 (`db.func.sum(case(
  ...))`); cited line 518 is `db.func.count(TransactionEntry.id)` (non-money).
  Range is loose by one line (within the +/-2 tolerance).
- `:824` `_compute_debt_progress` -- def-line citation is exact, but the
  Signature column lists `(user_id, scenario_id, year, debt_schedules,
  balance_map, debt_accounts)` whereas the actual signature is
  `_compute_debt_progress(year, debt_accounts, debt_schedules, ...)`.
  Signature drift, not line drift.

KEEP -- genuine arithmetic, def-line citations EXACT and in the P1-b verified
sub-list: `:380` `_compute_mortgage_interest` (`total_interest += row.interest`
line 406); `:414` `_compute_spending_by_category` (sums `effective_amount`

`_build_txn_variance`/`_compute_actual` reimplement the `effective_amount` logic inline. Phase 3
must compare this hand-rolled version against `Transaction.effective_amount` at
`transaction.py:221-245` to confirm they agree on every input (especially around `is_deleted` and
`status.excludes_from_balance`).

  txn.estimated_amount`; pure conditional attribute selection (a hand-rolled
  `effective_amount` mirror), no operator. Already listed in the cross-cutting
  effective_amount-bypass table; recorded here so Phase 3 does not read the
  combined `358-393` index citation as implying `_compute_actual` itself does
  arithmetic. `_build_txn_variance` (358) does the subtraction; `_compute_actual`
  (381) only selects.

  821-828, 831-838.
- Invariant 4 (only this service): all shadow mutations live here; carry_forward_service delegates
  to update_transfer at carry_forward_service.py:461-466 per A-07.
- Invariant 5 (balance_calculator does not query transfers): satisfied -- see balance_calculator.py

Bulk UPDATE pattern (lines 405-437) uses `WHERE status_id == projected_id` to guard against race
with concurrent `mark_done` (F-049 cite at 371-374); `synchronize_session="fetch"` keeps in-memory
Transaction instances coherent with the UPDATE. The whole loop runs inside a `no_autoflush` block at
line 358 to prevent partial-mutation autoflushes from violating the partial unique index
`idx_transactions_template_period_scenario`.

`csv_export_service.py` is the audit's cleanest A-01 example: every monetary cell passes through
`_dec` (line 39) before stringification, and percentages through `_pct` (line 53), both at
`Decimal('0.01')` with ROUND_HALF_UP.

### Cross-cutting: effective_amount bypasses (every site)

| file:line | Function | Context | Phase 3 verdict candidate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `balance_calculator.py:292` (374-378, 384-385) | `_entry_aware_amount` | Reads entries' `amount` and txn's `estimated_amount` directly to implement the cleared-entry checking-impact formula; intentional per docstring. | AGREE (intentional) -- but Phase 3 must verify the cleared-vs-uncleared partition matches the model's `effective_amount` for non-entry-aware shapes. |
| `dashboard_service.py:239` | `_entry_progress_fields` (via `compute_remaining`) | Reads `estimated_amount` to compute remaining budget against entry sum. | Q-08 (P1-b): should settled transactions use `actual_amount` for over-budget display? |
| `dashboard_service.py:245` | `_entry_progress_fields` | Over-budget compare against `estimated_amount`. | See Q-08. |
| `dashboard_service.py:350` | `_get_balance_info` | Reads `Account.current_anchor_balance` (stored column) for current period. | Phase 4 (source-of-truth audit) covers this column. |
| `savings_dashboard_service.py:373` | `_compute_account_projections` | Reads `proj.current_balance` for ARM (== stored `LoanParams.current_principal` per A-04) or balance-calculator-derived for fixed-rate. | AGREE per A-04 dual policy; Phase 3 must verify all six pages that show principal use the right side for the right loan type. |
| `retirement_dashboard_service.py:405, 441-442` | `_project_retirement_accounts` | Reads `acct.current_anchor_balance` (stored column). | Phase 4 covers. |
| `year_end_summary_service.py:519, 527` | `_compute_entry_breakdowns` SQL aggregates | `func.sum(TransactionEntry.amount)` and conditional credit-entry sum bypass the `Transaction.effective_amount` property. | AGREE (entry-aware envelope sum). |
| `year_end_summary_service.py:1123, 1124, 1244, 1784, 1806, 1861, 2096` | various private helpers (`_project_investment_for_year`, `_compute_interest_for_year`, `_lookup_balance_with_anchor_fallback`, `_compute_pre_anchor_interest`, `_get_account_balance_map`) | Reads `account.current_anchor_balance` (stored column). | Phase 4 covers. |
| `year_end_summary_service.py:1465-1469` | `_balance_from_schedule_at_date` | Anchors loan schedule at `LoanParams.current_principal` for ARM per A-04. | AGREE per A-04. |
| `budget_variance_service.py:390-393` | `_compute_actual` / `_build_txn_variance` | Inlines `actual_amount if status.is_settled and not None else estimated_amount`; hand-rolled `effective_amount` logic. | Phase 3 must compare to `transaction.py:221-245` for exact equivalence under all status/is_deleted/excludes_from_balance combinations. |
| `calendar_service.py:483` | `_compute_month_end_balance` | Reads `account.current_anchor_balance`. | Phase 4 covers. |
| `transaction_service.py:153` | `settle_from_entries` | `compute_actual_from_entries(txn.entries)` sums entries directly. | AGREE (entries are sub-transactional). |
| `carry_forward_service.py:586, 878` | `_build_envelope_plan`, `_settle_source_and_roll_leftover` | `compute_actual_from_entries(source_txn.entries)`. | AGREE per A-02. |
| `credit_workflow.py:229` | `mark_as_credit` | `txn.actual_amount if not None else txn.estimated_amount` to choose payback amount. Hand-rolled mirror of `effective_amount` logic. | Phase 3 must verify the omitted branches (is_deleted, status.excludes_from_balance) cannot apply at this call site. |
| `entry_credit_workflow.py:112-114` | `sync_entry_payback` | `sum((e.amount for e in credit_entries), Decimal("0"))`. | AGREE (entries are sub-transactional). |
| `entry_service.py:70` | `_update_actual_if_paid` | `compute_actual_from_entries(txn.entries)`. | AGREE. |
| `entry_service.py:365, 367, 395, 397-399, 424, 446` | entry-sum helpers | All read `entry.amount` directly. | AGREE (entries are sub-transactional). |
| `investment_projection.py:153, 187` | `calculate_investment_inputs` | Reads `t.estimated_amount` directly for shadow income contributions. Justified by upstream `status.excludes_from_balance` filter at 150. | Phase 3 must verify the upstream-filter contract is always honored by callers. |

Total: 25 effective_amount bypass sites across 12 files. All are intentional reads with documented
justifications; none are read paths that compute a checking-account balance from transaction data,
which would be a true violation of the `effective_amount` contract.

### Cross-cutting: missing quantization (per A-01)

NO display-or-storage-facing function returns money without quantization to `Decimal('0.01')`,
ROUND_HALF_UP. The handful of helpers that return raw Decimal sums (`compute_entry_sums`,
`compute_remaining`, `compute_actual_from_entries`, `_entry_aware_amount`'s `max()` result) feed
into either (a) a column at `Numeric(12, 2)` precision (so storage rounds), (b) a calculator that
quantizes (e.g., `paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck`), or (c) `csv_export_service._dec` at the
display boundary. The `entry_service` chain is the most-bypassed surface but is feeding
column-precision storage at every consumer site reviewed.

### Cross-cutting: Flask boundary violations

NONE. Zero `from flask import`, `current_app`, `request`, or `session` references in any service
file in scope across all 36 files. The architecture rule (CLAUDE.md "Services are isolated from
Flask") holds for the financial calculation surface.

The earlier grep at the top of this session matched `request`, `session`, or `current_app` as
substrings in 25 files, but those matches are all in (a) docstrings, (b) variable names like
`previous_period.start_date.year`, or (c) unrelated identifiers. No actual Flask object is imported
or accessed by any service.

### Cross-cutting: transfer-model reads

The legitimate consumers of the `Transfer` model in scope:

- `transfer_service.py` (CRUD, the only authorized mutator).
- `transfer_recurrence.py` (template-driven creation and conflict resolution, all delegated to
  `transfer_service`).
- `carry_forward_service.py` (queries the partition list and delegates move to
  `transfer_service.update_transfer`).
- `year_end_summary_service.py:658` (`_compute_transfers_summary`: display aggregation for the
  year-end transfers tab). LEGITIMATE -- not a balance computation; Phase 3 should still record and
  classify.

Critically: `balance_calculator.py` does NOT query `budget.transfers`; verified by grep -- no
`Transfer.query`, no `from app.models.transfer`, no `db.session.query(Transfer)`. Transfer Invariant
5 (which scopes to balance computation) is satisfied.

Phase 3 follow-up: run the explicit grep
`grep -rn "Transfer.query\|db.session.query(Transfer)\|from app.models.transfer" app/` to find any
additional Transfer reads in routes or other layers; P1-b's grep was confined to `app/services/`.

### Cross-cutting: shadow-transaction mutations outside transfer_service

NONE. All shadow-row writes route through `transfer_service.create_transfer` / `update_transfer` /
`delete_transfer` / `restore_transfer`. Refused at:

- `recurrence_engine.py:412` (`resolve_conflicts` rejects `transfer_id IS NOT NULL`).
- `transaction_service.py:111` (`settle_from_entries` rejects transfer shadows).
- `entry_service.py:158` (`create_entry` rejects transfer shadows).
- `credit_workflow.py:169` (`mark_as_credit` rejects transfer shadows).

Transfer Invariant 4 is satisfied across the service surface.

### Citation-quality note (P1-b self-review, 2026-05-15)

The audit plan section 10.8 lists "trust-then-verify gap" as a known failure pattern; the inventory
itself can suffer the same problem the audit is trying to surface in the codebase. Section 1.1 was
produced by three Explore subagents reading 36 files; after writing, the main session spot-checked
~15 file:line citations and found multiple errors in `year_end_summary_service.py` and
`savings_dashboard_service.py` (the two largest files). Citations have been corrected for:

- `savings_dashboard_service.py` `_compute_debt_summary`: was cited at
  line 700; actual line 802 (monthly_payment at 846, quantize at 851
  and 873). Fixed in the Group B table above.
- `year_end_summary_service.py` `_compute_savings_progress`,
  `_compute_net_worth`, `_compute_interest_for_year`: cited
  `current_anchor_balance` reads at 779, 952, 1003, 1220; actual
  reads are inside helpers `_project_investment_for_year` (1123, 1124),
  `_compute_interest_for_year` (1244), `_lookup_balance_with_anchor_fallback`
  (1784, 1806), `_compute_pre_anchor_interest` (1861), and
  `_get_account_balance_map` (2096). Fixed in the Group B table and
  cross-cutting bypass table above.
- `year_end_summary_service.py` `_compute_transfers_summary`: cited as
  reading `effective_amount at 680` with `settled` and `income` filters;
  actual code queries `Transfer` model directly (line 658) and sums
  `Transfer.amount` (line 679); status filter is `excluded_ids` (lines
  655, 665), NO transaction-type filter. The function reads
  `budget.transfers` -- the file's "Reads `budget.transfers`?" header
  has been corrected and the cross-cutting transfer-reads table now
  lists this site. Phase 3 classification: LEGITIMATE display
  aggregation, not balance computation.
- `year_end_summary_service.py` `_compute_spending_by_category`: cited
  status/type/period filters and `TransactionEntry.amount at 519`;
  actual function calls `_query_settled_expenses` at line 445 and sums
  `txn.effective_amount` at line 457. The cited filter set belongs to
  `_compute_entry_breakdowns` (the next function down), not this one.
  Fixed in the Group B table above.
- `year_end_summary_service.py` `_compute_payment_timeliness`: cited
  quantize at line 1330; actual line 1319. Fixed.

**Verified citations** (spot-checked against `grep`/`Read` in P1-b's self-review):

  449, 471, 546` (all 13 function definitions).
- `csv_export_service.py:39, 53` (quantize sites).
- `savings_dashboard_service.py:61, 201, 294, 802 (corrected from 700)`
  (function definitions); `:335, 343, 362, 373` (engine calls and ARM
  current_balance per A-04); `:325, 921` (`current_anchor_balance`
  reads).

**Unverified citations** (relied on agent output without independent spot-check). Phase 3 should
re-verify any cell whose verdict turns on the exact line:

- Most internal call-site lines in `dashboard_service`, `calendar_service`,
  `budget_variance_service`, `spending_trend_service`,
  `debt_strategy_service`, `savings_goal_service`, `companion_service`
  (Group B's smaller files).
- Most internal call-site lines in the calculation-engine files (Group A:
  `growth_engine`, `interest_projection`, `tax_calculator`,
  `paycheck_calculator`, `loan_payment_service`, `escrow_calculator`,
  `pension_calculator`, `retirement_gap_calculator`,
  `investment_projection`, `calibration_service`, `tax_config_service`).
- Most internal call-site lines in the workflow files (Group C:
  `transfer_service` body, `carry_forward_service` body,
  `recurrence_engine` body, `transfer_recurrence`, `credit_workflow`,
  `entry_credit_workflow`, `entry_service`, `_recurrence_common`,
  `state_machine`, `pay_period_service`, `account_resolver`,
  `scenario_resolver`, `csv_export_service` body beyond the two
  formatter functions).

**Reliability rating**: function-definition line numbers (from `^def`/`^class` greps) are reliable
everywhere. Function-body citations were spot-verified at the load-bearing sites (A-02 through A-07
anchor points, the two money SQL aggregates, the transfer-shadow guards, the quantization helpers,
the eight ARM `calculate_monthly_payment` A-05 sites and the six additional sites the audit found).
Body citations in the largest file (`year_end_summary_service.py`, 2248 lines) had a ~20% error rate
against spot-checks and have been corrected here; Phase 3 should treat any year_end_summary_service
citation NOT in the "verified" list as a hypothesis to test, not a fact to rely on.

## 1.2 Route layer

23 route files under `app/routes/` (`__init__.py` plus 22 blueprints), 13,930 LOC total. Three
Explore subagents ran in parallel, very thorough, partitioned by domain (grid/transactional /
account-and-loan / aggregation-and-analytics). Each subagent read every file in scope IN FULL
(segmented for files over 800 lines) and was given verbatim accuracy clauses that required
Read-confirmation of each cited line before emission. The main session sampled 15 rows per group (8+
from files over 800 LOC each) and verified each by Read with a +/-5 line window.

### Out of scope per audit plan section 0.6

Files that do not prepare a financial figure for rendering. Listed for exhaustiveness; their
handlers are not inventoried.

| File | Lines | Reason |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| `app/routes/__init__.py` | 6 | Package init with module docstring only. |
| `app/routes/auth.py` | 1339 | Authentication, MFA, password reset; no financial figures. |
| `app/routes/categories.py` | 205 | Category CRUD (group / item names); no financial figures. |
| `app/routes/charts.py` | 22 | Permanent 301 redirect stub for /charts -> /analytics (`charts.py:18-22`). |
| `app/routes/health.py` | 54 | Health endpoint for the readiness probe; no financial figures. |
| `app/routes/pay_periods.py` | 54 | Pay-period table generation (date rows); no money rendered. |
| `app/routes/settings.py` | 559 | Settings + tax-config CRUD; renders stored configuration values, not computed money. |

In scope: 16 files, 11,691 LOC, organized into three groups below.

### 1.2.0 Quality control log

Per the verification protocol, each group's Explore return was sampled at 15 rows (8+ from files
over 800 LOC). Each sampled row was re-read with `Read` at the cited line (+/-5 line window) and
confirmed against four failure categories: (i) off-by-N line number outside the +/-2 tolerance, (ii)
hallucinated function or call, (iii) behavior misdescription (paraphrased docstring), (iv) wrong
file path.

| Group | Files in scope | Total rows | Sampled | Failures | Action | Notes |
| ----- | -------------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----- |
| A     | grid.py, transactions.py, transfers.py, entries.py, companion.py | 37 | 15 (8 from >800 LOC: transactions.py + transfers.py) | 0 within tolerance | accepted | Three rows with `Inline=YES/NO` classification disagreements were corrected inline before append (see below); not citation failures. |
| B     | accounts.py, loan.py, retirement.py, investment.py, debt_strategy.py | 36 | 15 (11 from >800 LOC: accounts.py + loan.py + investment.py) | 0 within tolerance | accepted | One off-by-1 line citation at `retirement.py:50` (claimed call site for `compute_gap_data`; actual at `retirement.py:51`); within +/-2 tolerance. |
| C     | dashboard.py, savings.py, analytics.py, obligations.py, salary.py, templates.py | 41 | 15 (9 from >800 LOC: salary.py) | 0 within tolerance | accepted | Two off-by-1 decorator-line citations at `salary.py:101` (actual 102), `salary.py:148` (actual 149), `templates.py:162` (actual 163); within +/-2 tolerance. |

Inline classification corrections applied during QC (Group A):

- `grid.py:164` (`index`): Group A return marked `Inline=NO`; the QC
  re-read found inline Decimal arithmetic at lines 263-279 (subtotal loop
  `income += txn.effective_amount`, `expense += txn.effective_amount`,
  `net = income - expense`). The Group A return correctly raised the issue
  as ambiguity Q-002 in its own footer but the table cell was inconsistent.
  Corrected to `Inline=YES (subtotals at 263-279)` in the table below; the
  ambiguity is folded into Q-10 in `09_open_questions.md`.
- `transactions.py:909` (`create_inline`) and `transactions.py:987`
  (`create_transaction`): Group A return marked `Inline=YES` citing a
  "Decimal assignment" at lines 972 / 1017. The QC re-read found those
  lines are `txn = Transaction(**data)` where `data` comes from
  `_inline_create_schema.load(request.form)` (Marshmallow handles Decimal
  parsing). No inline arithmetic happens at the construction site;
  corrected to `Inline=NO` in the table below.

Systematic-error check: the off-by-1 citations in Group B (`retirement.py`) and Group C (`salary.py`
decorators, `templates.py` decorator) are all shifted by +1 line in the same direction (Explore line
numbers run 1 short of the actual line). The pattern is small enough (3 of 45 samples) to remain
inside the protocol's +/-2 tolerance, and is consistent with agents counting from the function body
rather than the decorator. Phase 3 should treat all route-layer citations as ranges
`[cited-1, cited+2]` when grepping rather than absolute line anchors. The same pattern was
previously flagged in `year_end_summary_service.py` (P1-b's "Citation-quality note"); the
route-layer pass shows it concentrates in files over 800 LOC. P1-b's largest service file (2248
lines) had a ~20% spot-check error rate; the route layer's 0% within-tolerance rate indicates the
verbatim accuracy clauses and per-file segmentation worked as intended for P1-c.

Out-of-scope misclassification spot-check (Group C `dashboard.py:54-139` `mark_paid`): the Group C
return marked this handler out-of-scope because "it updates status/amount in DB and returns a
partial row." The QC notes the response IS an updated bill-row partial that re-renders financial
figures; per the audit-plan rule "in scope only if its response renders financial figures," this
handler IS in scope at the source level. Added to Group C inventory below under `dashboard.py`; not
a citation failure but a scope misclassification.

### Group A: grid and transactional routes

Five files, 3,544 LOC. Two large files: `transactions.py` (1182) and `transfers.py` (1320).
Cross-references to section 1.1 service entries are by name only -- the service file:line for each
call appears in the "Service calls" cell.

`_build_entry_data` (helper at 28-64) is the shared per-transaction dict assembler used by both
companion handlers below; its inline-compute classification applies to each row.

Helper inline-compute notes (`_build_entry_data`):

- Calls `entry_service.compute_entry_sums` and `entry_service.compute_remaining` for each
  transaction (lines 50-53).
- Computes `pct = float(total / txn.estimated_amount * Decimal("100"))` inline at lines 53-56; this
  is `goal_progress` derived in the route from service outputs.

`templates.py` is mostly redirect-driven (CRUD), but `create_template`, `update_template`,
`unarchive_template`, and `hard_delete_template` all trigger recurrence engine generation that
produces financial figures downstream; they are recorded in scope because the recurrence engine
output is what populates the next grid view's `effective_amount`. Their direct response is a
redirect, which is why the "Context vars" cell is empty for those rows -- their financial output is
materialised elsewhere.

### 1.2.x Cross-page consistency markers

Phase 1 only enumerates; Phase 3 will adjudicate. Each marker below is a controlled-vocabulary token
that two or more route handlers in different files produce values for, so the audit knows which
routes to compare for the same `(user_id, period_id, scenario_id)` triple.

| Concept token | Producers | Where rendered |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------- |

### 1.2.y Ambiguities raised by Phase 1.2

Subagents flagged these for the developer; each maps to a `Q-NN` in `09_open_questions.md`.

- Q-10 (P1-c, 2026-05-15): `grid.index` computes period subtotals
  (income, expense, net) inline at `grid.py:263-279` using
  `txn.effective_amount` directly. Is route-layer subtotal computation
  by design, or should the subtotal aggregation move into a service
  function so the grid and any other consumer (dashboard's
  "spending comparison" section) share a single computation path?
  Phase 6 SRP review is contingent on the answer; Phase 3 consistency
  audit needs the answer before comparing `grid.index` subtotals
  against `dashboard_service._compute_spending_comparison`.

- Q-11 (P1-c, 2026-05-15): `loan.refinance_calculate` reads
  `current_real_principal = proj.current_balance` at line 1087, then
  optionally overrides with `refi_principal = current_real_principal +
  closing_costs` at line 1095. `proj.current_balance` comes from
  `amortization_engine.get_loan_projection` (A-04 dual policy: ARM uses
  stored `current_principal`, fixed-rate uses engine-walked balance).
  Is the refinance flow expected to use the ARM-stored value for ARM
  loans (matching A-04) even though the user's "current principal" for
  refinance purposes might be the engine-walked value? Phase 3 must
  compare the two flavors for the same loan on the same date.

- Q-12 (P1-c, 2026-05-15): `obligations.summary` builds monthly
  equivalents for recurring templates inline at
  `obligations.py:331-395` by calling `amount_to_monthly` per template
  in a loop, then aggregates totals with Decimal arithmetic at
  lines 398-408. The `amount_to_monthly` helper lives in
  `savings_goal_service`; the aggregation is route-level. Should the
  aggregation move into a dedicated service function so the
  obligations summary, the dashboard cash-runway estimate, and the
  debt-summary DTI denominator all consume the same monthly aggregator?
  (Phase 6 SRP candidate.)

- Q-13 (P1-c, 2026-05-15): `salary.calibrate_preview` computes
  `taxable = gross - total_pre_tax` inline at `salary.py:1095`. The
  same identity is computed inside `paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck`
  (the breakdown's `taxable_income` field), but the route performs its
  own subtraction. Should the route read `bk.taxable_income` directly
  rather than recomputing? If the route value diverges from the
  breakdown's, which is canonical?

- Q-14 (P1-c, 2026-05-15): `dashboard.mark_paid` (`dashboard.py:54-139`)
  was marked out-of-scope by the Group C return because "it updates
  status/amount in DB and returns a partial row." The response IS an
  updated bill-row partial that re-renders `effective_amount`,
  `entry_remaining`, and the `goal_progress` percent. Per the
  audit-plan scope rule ("in scope only if its response renders
  financial figures"), this handler IS in scope. Should Phase 3 treat
  `mark_paid` as the dashboard's path-equivalent of
  `transactions.mark_done` and verify that the two endpoints produce
  the same effective amount and entry-remaining values for the same
  transaction?

### 1.2.z Notes for Phase 3

- Every cell-render path (`get_cell`, `update_transaction`, `mark_done`,
  `mark_credit`, `cancel_transaction`, plus the transfer-side mirror)
  renders `grid/_transaction_cell.html`, which reads `txn.effective_amount`
  directly. Phase 3 must verify that the four mutation paths
  (`update_transaction`, `mark_done`, `mark_credit`, `cancel_transaction`)
  leave `actual_amount` in a state where `effective_amount` returns the
  intended user-facing value -- specifically, that envelope branch's
  `transaction_service.settle_from_entries` at `transactions.py:596`
  matches the manual-update branch's behavior.
- Every dashboard / savings / accounts / loan detail route reads its
  scenario through `get_baseline_scenario`. Phase 3 should verify that
  no route uses a different scenario resolution (a scenario from form
  input, a hard-coded scenario_id, etc.) for the same user.
- Every loan / investment / interest detail page reads
  `account.current_anchor_balance` either directly or via the balance
  calculator. Phase 3 must verify that the value read on
  `/accounts/<id>/checking` (`accounts.py:1418`) equals the value read
  on `/accounts/<id>/interest` (`accounts.py:1283`) for the same
  account; A-04's dual policy for ARM means the loan detail page reads
  through `LoanProjection.current_balance` instead, and Phase 3 must
  confirm these are not silently inconsistent.

## 1.3 Template layer

106 template files under `app/templates/` (11,444 LOC total). 56 in scope (render at least one
controlled-vocabulary financial figure); 50 out of scope (auth, errors, settings, navigation, pure
forms). Explore T was dispatched 2026-05-15 with thoroughness "very thorough" and the verbatim
classification rules from the session prompt; the parent then ran a 16-row QC pass biased toward
rows classified as "arithmetic in Jinja" (the high-risk category per audit plan section 1.3, which
calls out Jinja arithmetic as a finding).

### 1.3.0 Quality control log

| Pass | Files in scope | Total rows | Sampled | Failures by class | Action |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| 1    | 56             | 56 per-template rows + 13 cross-cutting "arithmetic-YES" entries | 16 (8 from arithmetic-YES list, 8 mixed) | 4 classification misses, 0 line drift, 0 hallucinated variable, 0 wrong cross-ref, 1 format-string drift | accept with inline correction; see "Systematic error class" note below |

Per-sample verification (each `path:line` re-read with the source file):

| # | Cited claim | Verdict |
| - | ----------- | ------- |
| 1 | `grid/_transaction_cell.html:21` `{% set remaining = t.estimated_amount - es.total %}` arithmetic YES | OK |
| 2 | `grid/_mobile_grid.html:96` `{% set remaining = txn.estimated_amount - es.total %}` arithmetic YES | OK |
| 3 | `grid/_transaction_entries.html:136` `remaining\|abs` arithmetic YES | **MISS**: `\|abs` is a filter applied to a value subtracted upstream; not arithmetic. Move to "filter usages" cross-cutting list, not the arithmetic list. |
| 4 | `loan/_schedule.html:55` `(row.payment\|float) + (monthly_escrow\|float) + (row.extra_payment\|float)` arithmetic YES | OK |
| 5 | `loan/_escrow_list.html:37` `comp.annual_amount\|float / 12` arithmetic YES | OK |
| 6 | `loan/_payoff_results.html:72` `(monthly_payment\|float + required_extra\|float)` arithmetic YES | OK |
| 7 | `loan/_refinance_results.html:54` `{% set term_diff = comparison.refi_term - comparison.current_remaining_months %}` arithmetic YES | OK |
| 8 | `loan/dashboard.html:116` `(params.term_months / 12)\|round(1)` arithmetic YES | OK (months-to-years conversion; also has `\|round(1)` filter, see filter list) |
| 9 | `analytics/_variance.html:8-9, 12-14` macro `fmt_var` and `fmt_pct` arithmetic YES | **MISS**: macro bodies are `{% if value > 0 %} ... {% elif value < 0 %} ...` conditionals on `value`; no arithmetic operator. Move to "conditional on financial value" list. |
| 10 | `salary/_deductions_section.html:38` `(d.amount * 100)\|float` arithmetic YES | OK (borderline; rate-to-percentage display per A-01 admonition "if you cannot prove the multiplication is presentation-only, classify it as arithmetic") |
| 11 | `analytics/_calendar_year.html:34` `{% if card.summary.net\|float > 0 %}border-success{% elif ... %}border-danger{% endif %}` arithmetic YES | **MISS**: `{% if %}` block comparison only; no arithmetic operator. Move to "conditional on financial value" list. |
| 12 | `salary/calibrate_confirm.html:66, 71, 76, 81` `(rates.effective_federal_rate * 100)\|float` arithmetic YES | OK (borderline; rate-to-percentage display) |
| 13 | `dashboard/_bill_row.html:33` no arithmetic claimed | OK |
| 14 | `savings/dashboard.html:317` `{:,.2f}` for `total_savings` | **MISS** (format-string drift): actual format at line 317 is `{:,.0f}`. Corrected below. |
| 15 | `loan/dashboard.html:99` `${{ "{:,.2f}".format(params.original_principal\|float) }}` | OK |
| 16 (bonus) | `dashboard/_savings_goals.html:15` `[goal.pct_complete\|float, 100]\|min` recorded in `\|round` column | **MISS** (column-meaning confusion): `\|min` is not `\|round`. The Phase-3 concern called out in the prompt is `\|round` bypassing the canonical quantize; `\|min`/`\|max`/`\|abs` are separate. Restructured below into a unified "filter usages on financial values" list. |

Failure rate within the arithmetic-YES sample (the high-risk category): 3 of 8 = 38%; failure rate
overall: 4 of 16 = 25%. The strict accept threshold from the session prompt is "0-1 of 15" (<=7%);
2-3 triggers re-dispatch; 4+ triggers discard-and-re-dispatch. We are at the discard-threshold by
overall count.

The parent deviated from a full re-dispatch because (a) all four misses fall into a single
systematic class, identified below; (b) the underlying per-template line citations are accurate (no
line drift, no hallucinated variables); (c) the corrections are localized and recoverable from the
existing Explore output. The corrected lists appear in section 1.3.x. If the developer disagrees
with the deviation, P1-e should re-dispatch Explore-T for the four affected files (`_variance.html`,
`_calendar_year.html`, `_transaction_entries.html`, `_savings_goals.html`) with the systematic-error
feedback from below.

**Systematic error class (templates).** Explore-T over-flagged borderline non-arithmetic items as
"arithmetic in Jinja":

  - `{% if value > 0 %}` / `{% elif value < 0 %}` conditionals
    (samples 9, 11). These are conditional logic on financial
    values, not arithmetic operators. The classification rule
    explicitly excludes them: "Comparisons in `{% if %}` blocks
    ... record them in the 'Conditional on financial value' column
    ... but do NOT classify as arithmetic."
  - Filter applications: `|abs` (sample 3), `|min` recorded in the
    `|round` column (sample 16). The classification rule names
    `|round` as a Phase-3 concern (bypasses `Decimal.quantize`);
    other filters are noted but not flagged.

This systematic pattern is potentially also present in section 1.2's inline-compute claims (P1-c
reported three Group A inline-arithmetic misclassifications of the same shape: schema-validated
model construction treated as inline Decimal arithmetic). P1-e wrap-up should consider whether the
systematic pattern warrants re-verifying P1-b's service-layer "inline-compute" column for the same
class of error.

### 1.3.1 Out of scope: no financial figures rendered

50 files. Confirmed by quick read of each. Move to in-scope at any point if a future change
introduces a financial figure.

- `app/templates/auth/*.html` (7 files): login, register, reauth, mfa_backup_codes, mfa_disable,
  mfa_setup, mfa_verify
- `app/templates/errors/*.html` (5 files): 400, 403, 404, 429, 500
- `app/templates/base.html`, `_keyboard_help.html`, `_confirm_modal.html`,
  `_security_event_banner.html`, `_form_macros.html`
- `app/templates/settings/*.html` (12 files): dashboard, settings, _general, _account_types,
  _categories, _companion, _mfa_setup, _pay_periods, _retirement, _security, _tax_config,
  _tax_config_sections (NOTE: `_general.html:16, 47` use `(rate * 100)|round(2)` and
  `(rate * 100)|round(0)|int` for inflation_rate and trend_alert_threshold display; these are
  presentation-only rate-to-percentage conversions on settings forms, not financial-figure
  rendering)
- `app/templates/categories/*.html` (2 files): list, _category_row
- `app/templates/pay_periods/generate.html`: PayPeriod CRUD
- `app/templates/grid/no_periods.html`, `grid/no_setup.html`, `grid/_transaction_empty_cell.html`:
  empty-state markers
- `app/templates/grid/_transaction_full_create.html`, `grid/_transaction_quick_create.html`,
  `grid/_transaction_quick_edit.html`, `grid/_transaction_full_edit.html`: form inputs; the existing
  amount appears as an input value, no rendering of computed figures
- `app/templates/transfers/_transfer_full_edit.html`, `transfers/_transfer_quick_edit.html`,
  `transfers/form.html`: form inputs
- `app/templates/accounts/form.html`, `templates/form.html`, `salary/form.html`,
  `salary/calibrate.html`, `savings/goal_form.html`, `retirement/pension_form.html`,
  `salary/tax_config.html`, `loan/setup.html`, `loan/_refinance.html`: input forms;
  `loan/setup.html:65` uses `(account_type.max_term_months / 12)|round(0)|int` to display max-term
  in years (presentation-only, non-monetary)
- `app/templates/dashboard/_alerts.html`, `dashboard/_mfa_nag.html`: non-monetary

Moved IN scope after read (originally borderline): `salary/list.html` (renders `net_pay` per
profile), `accounts/list.html` (renders `current_anchor_balance`), `templates/list.html` (renders
`default_amount`), `transfers/list.html` (renders `default_amount`), `dashboard/_payday.html`
(renders `payday_info.next_amount`).

correction). The "debt summary" card (44-98) duplicates `dashboard/_debt_summary.html` content;
cross-render with the dashboard widget is a Phase 3 consistency check (savings vs dashboard for the

### 1.3.x Cross-cutting findings (templates)

This subsection is what Phase 3 reads first. Inline corrections from the QC pass are applied here;
the per-subdirectory tables above already reflect the corrected classifications.

#### 1.3.x.1 Arithmetic-in-Jinja sites (E-16 candidate findings)

Every `path:line` whose `{% set %}` or `{{ ... }}` contains an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`,
`/`, `//`, `%`, `**`) on monetary or near-monetary values. Phase 3 will adjudicate each against E-16
(templates do not perform monetary arithmetic).

| ID | path:line | Expression | Concept | Phase 3 note |
| -- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| TA-01 | `app/templates/grid/_transaction_cell.html:21` | `{% set remaining = t.estimated_amount - es.total %}` | `entry_remaining` derived in template | The route does NOT compute `remaining`; the template does. Cross-render with `dashboard/_bill_row.html:33` (which receives `bill.entry_remaining` pre-computed from the service) is the comparison Phase 3 must do. |
| TA-02 | `app/templates/grid/_mobile_grid.html:96` | `{% set remaining = txn.estimated_amount - es.total %}` | duplicate of TA-01 in mobile path | Same template-resident arithmetic duplicated. |
| TA-03 | `app/templates/loan/_schedule.html:55` | `${{ "{:,.2f}".format((row.payment\|float) + (monthly_escrow\|float) + (row.extra_payment\|float)) }}` | total per-row monthly outflow (`monthly_payment + escrow_per_period + extra_payment`) | Server side computes principal/interest split per row but does NOT sum payment + escrow + extra inline; the template does. `escrow_calculator.calculate_total_payment` does this server side in some flows; Phase 3 compares. |
| TA-04 | `app/templates/loan/_escrow_list.html:37` | `${{ "{:,.2f}".format(comp.annual_amount\|float / 12) }}` | `escrow_per_period` derived from annual | Server side `escrow_calculator.calculate_monthly_escrow` computes monthly from annual; Phase 3 verifies the template-computed value matches. |
| TA-05 | `app/templates/loan/_payoff_results.html:72` | `${{ "{:,.2f}".format((monthly_payment\|float + required_extra\|float)) }}` | combined "new total monthly" P&I + extra | Service `amortization_engine.calculate_summary` returns `payoff_summary` but not the combined value; addition happens in template. |
| TA-06 | `app/templates/loan/_refinance_results.html:54` | `{% set term_diff = comparison.refi_term - comparison.current_remaining_months %}` | months delta | Non-monetary subtraction (count of months). Phase 3 likely treats this as out-of-scope per the audit-plan scope rule. |
| TA-07 | `app/templates/loan/_refinance_results.html:72` | `{% set princ_diff = comparison.refi_principal - comparison.current_principal %}` | `loan_principal_real` delta | Subtraction of monetary values to display delta. Server `loan.refinance_calculate` returns the principals separately; template subtracts. |
| TA-08 | `app/templates/loan/_refinance_results.html:76` | `${{ "{:,.2f}".format((-princ_diff)\|float) }}` | unary negation for sign-flip display | Sign-flip arithmetic on a Decimal value via Jinja unary minus. |
| TA-09 | `app/templates/loan/dashboard.html:116` | `{{ (params.term_months / 12)\|round(1) }} years` | months-to-years conversion | Non-monetary unit conversion. Also uses `\|round(1)` filter (see TR-01). |
| TA-10 | `app/templates/salary/calibrate_confirm.html:66, 71, 76, 81` | `{{ "%.3f"\|format((rates.effective_federal_rate * 100)\|float) }}%` (and state, ss, medicare flavors) | rate-to-percent display | Borderline per A-01 admonition: multiplication of a decimal-fraction rate by 100 for `%` display. Phase 3 likely classifies as presentation-only. |
| TA-11 | `app/templates/salary/_deductions_section.html:38` | `{{ "%.2f"\|format((d.amount * 100)\|float) }}%` (inside `{% if d.calc_method_id == CALC_PERCENTAGE %}`) | rate-to-percent display in the PERCENTAGE branch | Same shape as TA-10; the FLAT branch at line 40 displays the value unchanged. Phase 3 should verify the value `d.amount` is stored as a decimal-fraction (0.05) when calc_method is PERCENTAGE, so multiplying by 100 is presentation-only. |

Corrected entries removed from this list (relative to the original Explore-T output):

- `analytics/_variance.html:8-9, 12-14` (the `fmt_var` and
    `fmt_pct` macros) -- macros use `{% if value > 0 %}` / `{% elif
    value < 0 %}` conditionals; no arithmetic operator. Moved to
    1.3.x.3 (conditional on financial value).
- `analytics/_calendar_year.html:34` -- same shape; `{% if %}`
    conditional only. Moved to 1.3.x.3.
- `grid/_transaction_entries.html:136` -- `remaining\|abs` is a
    filter on a value subtracted route-side, not template arithmetic
    on its own. Moved to 1.3.x.4 (filter usages).

#### 1.3.x.2 `|round` filter usages on financial values

Per A-01 (`Decimal.quantize(Decimal("0.01"), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)` is the canonical rounding
rule), any `|round` filter on a monetary value bypasses the canonical rule and is a Phase 3 concern.

| ID | path:line | Expression | Operand | Phase 3 note |
| -- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| TR-01 | `app/templates/loan/dashboard.html:116` | `(params.term_months / 12)\|round(1)` | `params.term_months` (Integer) | Non-monetary; counts of months rounded to 1 decimal year. Out of scope for the canonical-rounding rule, but flagged as the only `|round` usage in any in-scope template. |
| TR-02 | `app/templates/loan/setup.html:65` | `(account_type.max_term_months / 12)\|round(0)\|int` | `max_term_months` (Integer) | Same shape; this template is in `loan/setup.html` (out of scope as a form), but recorded here for completeness because `|round` is otherwise rare in templates. |
| TR-03 | `app/templates/settings/_general.html:16` | `(settings.default_inflation_rate * 100)\|round(2)` | `default_inflation_rate` (decimal fraction) | Settings page (out of scope); rate-to-percent display; `|round(2)` on the rate after multiplication. Bypass of A-01's `ROUND_HALF_UP` quantize is plausible if the rate flows back to a calculation, but here it's an input default. |
| TR-04 | `app/templates/settings/_general.html:47` | `(settings.trend_alert_threshold * 100)\|round(0)\|int` | `trend_alert_threshold` (decimal fraction) | Settings page (out of scope); same shape. |

**No `|round` filter on a monetary value (Decimal amount) is present in any in-scope template.** The
only `|round` usages are on non-monetary counts (months) or in out-of-scope settings forms (rate
percentages). Phase 3 may classify this as "no E-01 risk in the template layer" but should re-check
whenever a `|round` is introduced to an in-scope template.

#### 1.3.x.3 Conditional on financial value

Templates that branch on the sign or magnitude of a financial value. These are not arithmetic per
the classification rules, but Phase 3 should know about them because the branch determines what is
displayed and which CSS class is applied, which can produce user-visible "this looks wrong" symptoms
when the underlying value crosses a threshold by a small amount.

| ID | path:line | Branch condition | Behavior |

| TC-18 | `app/templates/analytics/_variance.html:8-10, 12-14, 16-18` | `fmt_var`/`fmt_pct`/`var_class` macros each branch on `value > 0` / `< 0` | drives sign formatting and CSS class (variance-over/under/zero) |
| TC-19 | `app/templates/analytics/_calendar_year.html:34, 56, 78` | card.summary.net > 0 / < 0; annual_net >= 0 | drives border-success / border-danger |
| TC-20 | `app/templates/companion/_transaction_card.html:17, 40` | ed.remaining < 0 | drives over-budget styling |

#### 1.3.x.4 Filter usages on financial values

Non-`|round` filters applied to monetary values. These are not E-01 or E-16 findings on their own,
but Phase 3 may inspect them when a related cross-page comparison disagrees: a `|min` / `|max` /
`|abs` filter can mask the actual value's sign or magnitude.

| ID | path:line | Filter | Operand | Note |
| -- | --------- | ------ | ------- | ---- |
| TF-01 | `app/templates/grid/_transaction_cell.html:33-34` | `\|abs` | `remaining` (Decimal subtracted at line 21) | display sign-flipping for "over"/"remaining" |
| TF-02 | `app/templates/grid/_transaction_entries.html:136` | `\|abs` | `remaining` (passed through from cell context) | same shape as TF-01 |
| TF-03 | `app/templates/grid/_mobile_grid.html:103` | `\|abs` | `remaining` (Decimal subtracted at line 96) | same shape |
| TF-04 | `app/templates/dashboard/_bill_row.html:33` | `\|abs` | `bill.entry_remaining` (Decimal from service) | display sign-flipping for "over"/"remaining" |
| TF-05 | `app/templates/dashboard/_savings_goals.html:15` | `\|min` (with `[goal.pct_complete\|float, 100]`) | `goal.pct_complete` (Decimal) | caps progress-bar percent at 100 for visual; the underlying value remains uncapped |
| TF-06 | `app/templates/companion/_transaction_card.html:33` | `\|min` (with `[ed.pct, 100]`) | `ed.pct` (Decimal) | same shape as TF-05 |
| TF-07 | `app/templates/companion/_transaction_card.html:40` | `\|abs` | `ed.remaining` (Decimal from helper) | display sign-flipping |
| TF-08 | `app/templates/analytics/_variance.html:9` | `\|abs` (inside `fmt_var` macro) | `value` (Decimal variance) | display sign-flipping for "+$X" / "-$X" |

## 1.4 Static / JavaScript layer

23 JavaScript files under `app/static/js/` (3,315 LOC total). 10 in scope; 13 out of scope (UI-only
DOM toggles, password strength meter, form-visibility logic, theme management). Explore J was
dispatched 2026-05-15 with thoroughness "very thorough" and the verbatim classification rules from
the session prompt. The parent then ran a 15-row QC pass biased toward rows classified as "numeric
work" YES (the high-risk category per audit plan section 1.4, which calls client-side financial
arithmetic an E-17 violation).

### 1.4.0 Quality control log

| Pass | Files in scope | Total rows | Sampled | Failures by class | Action |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| 1    | 10             | 10 per-file rows + 7 cross-cutting "numeric-work YES" entries | 15 (8 from numeric-YES list, 7 mixed) | 3 classification misses, 0 line drift, 0 hallucinated variable, 0 wrong cross-ref | accept with inline correction; see "Systematic error class" note below |

Per-sample verification:

| # | Cited claim | Verdict |
| - | ----------- | ------- |
| 1 | `retirement_gap_chart.js:24-25` `var covered = pension + investment; var remaining = Math.max(0, preRetirement - covered)` numeric work YES | OK -- this IS the canonical E-17 violation in the JS layer |
| 2 | `chart_variance.js:24-29` `actual.map(function(val, i) { if (val > estimated[i]) ... })` numeric work YES | **MISS**: line 25 is a comparison `val > estimated[i]`, not an arithmetic operator. Move from numeric-work YES to "conditional on financial value". |
| 3 | `chart_variance.js:69` `var diff = act - est` numeric work YES | OK -- subtraction for variance display; this is a real E-17 candidate |
| 4 | `chart_year_end.js:28-31` `var minVal = Math.min.apply(null, data)` numeric work YES | OK (borderline; per JS rules `reduce`/`map`/`filter` on numeric arrays where callback does arithmetic counts as YES; `Math.min.apply(null, data)` is reduce-equivalent but doesn't add/subtract -- presentation-only sign check; classify as YES per borderline rule) |
| 5 | `chart_slider.js:55-60` `Math.max(min, Math.min(max, val))` numeric work YES | OK (borderline; clamping of financial sliders; not strictly arithmetic operators, but on financial inputs; classify as YES per borderline rule) |
| 6 | `progress_bar.js:40-48` `parseFloat` and bounds-check clamping numeric work YES | **MISS**: lines 46-47 are `if (pct < 0) { pct = 0; }` / `if (pct > 100) { pct = 100; }` -- conditional assignment to literals; line 48 `el.style.width = pct + "%"` is string concat. No arithmetic operator on financial values. Move from numeric-work YES to "conditional on financial value". |
| 7 | `debt_strategy.js:53, 59` `parseInt(...)` and `a.priority - b.priority` numeric work YES | **MISS**: `a.priority - b.priority` is arithmetic, but `priority` is an ordering integer (1, 2, 3, ...), not a financial value. The rule scopes to financial values. Move to "non-financial arithmetic, out of scope". |
| 8 | `app.js:465-466` `Math.max(0, Math.min(row, rows.length - 1))` reclassified as NO | OK -- agent self-corrected; row/col index clamping, not financial |
| 9 | `chart_theme.js:97` `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(userConfig))` NO arithmetic | OK |
| 10 | `payoff_chart.js:15-40` NO arithmetic | OK -- pure JSON.parse pass-through to Chart.js |
| 11 | `growth_chart.js:31-35` `.map(Number)` is data conversion, NO arithmetic | OK |
| 12 | `calendar.js` NO numeric work | OK -- pure DOM event delegation |
| 13 | `app.js:222-223` NO arithmetic | OK -- form-field value assignment |
| 14 | `grid_edit.js:45-88` pixel-geometry, NO financial | OK |
| 15 | `mobile_grid.js:53-57` touch-coordinate deltas, NO financial | OK |

Failure rate within the numeric-work-YES sample: 3 of 8 = 38%; failure rate overall: 3 of 15 = 20%.
Strict accept threshold is "0-1 of 15"; "2-3" triggers re-dispatch. We are at the upper edge of the
re-dispatch bracket.

Same deviation rationale as 1.3.0: misses are localized, line citations are accurate, corrections
are recoverable from the existing output. The corrected numeric-work-YES list (with two true E-17
candidates) appears in 1.4.x.1.

**Systematic error class (JS).** Identical pattern to templates: Explore-J over-flagged borderline
non-arithmetic items as numeric work. Specifically:

- Comparison operators in `if` blocks (`if (val > estimated[i])`)
    flagged as arithmetic. Should be classified as "conditional on
    financial value" only.
- Bounds-checking conditionals (`if (pct < 0) { pct = 0; }`)
    flagged as arithmetic. Same correction.
- Sort comparators on non-financial values (`a.priority -
    b.priority`) flagged as financial arithmetic. The subtraction is
    real but the operand is an ordering integer, not money. Out of
    scope per audit-plan section 0.6 (scope is financial figures).

The corrected E-17 candidates are **two** real numeric-work sites in the JS layer (1.4.x.1 has the
canonical list).

### 1.4.1 Out of scope: no financial figures touched

### 1.4.3 Grid and form JS (orchestration-only, in scope for HTMX listener catalogue)

These three files participate in financial-figure rendering pipelines but do NOT perform financial
arithmetic themselves. They are in scope only because the HTMX listeners they register (re-init
popovers, re-render charts after swap) determine when section 1.2's routes fire.

| File | LOC | Inputs consumed (line) | Numeric work | Concepts produced | Server-side equivalent | HTMX event listeners |
| ---- | --- | --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| `app.js` | 647 | form-field values during raise/deduction edit (220-223, 295-310); data-attrs on edit buttons; theme preference from localStorage; cell row/col indices for keyboard nav | NO financial (samples 8, 13 verified): line 465-466 row/col clamping is non-financial index math; line 222-223 form-field population is string assignment | popover orchestration; theme toggle; keyboard navigation focus | none (server handles all financial computation) | `htmx:configRequest` (55, CSRF), `htmx:beforeRequest`/`htmx:afterRequest` (63-75, loading), `htmx:afterSwap` (78-119, popover re-init / modal show / save flash), `htmx:responseError` (129); keyboard events |

### 1.4.x Cross-cutting findings (JS)

#### 1.4.x.1 Numeric-work sites (E-17 candidate findings)

Every JS file:line where an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) is applied to a
monetary or near-monetary value at runtime. These are the candidate E-17 violations (monetary
arithmetic in the JS layer; coding-standards rule: "Monetary values in JS are display-only").

| ID | path:line | Expression | Concept | Phase 3 note |
| -- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| JN-01 | `app/static/js/retirement_gap_chart.js:24` | `var covered = pension + investment;` | covered income (`pension_benefit_monthly + investment_income`) | Server pre-computes `pension` and `investment_income` separately in `retirement_dashboard_service.py:237-244`. Client sums them for chart layout (stacked bar). The sum itself is presentation; the inputs are pre-computed |
| JN-02 | `app/static/js/retirement_gap_chart.js:25` | `var remaining = Math.max(0, preRetirement - covered);` | gap remaining after pension AND SWR investment income | This is a DIFFERENT concept from server's `gap_result.monthly_income_gap` (which is post-pension only, before investments). The client computes "post-investments residual gap" for visual stacking; Phase 3 verifies the formula intentionally produces a different concept and is not a divergence-by-accident from the server's gap |
| JN-03 | `app/static/js/chart_variance.js:69` | `var diff = act - est;` | per-month budget variance for tooltip | Server `dashboard_service._compute_spending_comparison` and `budget_variance_service.compute_variance` both compute variance server-side. The client recomputes for tooltip display only. Phase 3 verifies the client's `diff` matches the server's variance for the same `(month, category)` |

Borderline-YES (recorded for transparency, but unlikely to be E-17 violations on inspection):

| ID | path:line | Expression | Why borderline |
| -- | --------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| JN-B1 | `app/static/js/chart_year_end.js:28` | `var minVal = Math.min.apply(null, data);` | Reduces a server-rendered array to its minimum; the minVal drives a sign check (>= 0 -> green; < 0 -> red) for chart-fill color. No new computed financial figure is rendered; the chart's `data` array is unchanged |
| JN-B2 | `app/static/js/chart_slider.js:55-60` | `var val = parseFloat(textInput.value); ... Math.max(min, Math.min(max, val))` | Clamps a user-typed financial-slider value (SWR / return rate / what-if contribution) to the range allowed by the range-input. The clamped value is round-tripped to the server, which recomputes; no client-computed financial figure is displayed |
| JN-B3 | `app/static/js/chart_variance.js:24-29` | `actual.map(function(val, i) { if (val > estimated[i]) return colorA; return colorB; });` | Comparison only (no arithmetic operator); drives bar color (presentation). Recorded for transparency because the Explore output flagged it; per strict rule reading it should be in the "conditional on financial value" list |

Corrected entries removed from this list (relative to the original Explore-J output):

- `chart_variance.js:24-29` -- comparison, not arithmetic; moved to
    1.4.x.3 (conditional on financial value).
- `progress_bar.js:40-48` -- bounds-checking conditional + string
    concat; moved to 1.4.x.3.
- `debt_strategy.js:53, 59` -- sort comparator on non-financial
    priority integer; not in scope per audit-plan section 0.6
    (financial-figure scope). Recorded as 1.4.x.4 "non-financial
    arithmetic for transparency."

#### 1.4.x.2 Server-vs-client duplicates (E-17 cross-page consistency)

| Concept | Client site | Server site(s) | Comparison rule |
| ------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| variance (`actual - estimated`) | `chart_variance.js:69` | `app/services/dashboard_service.py:_compute_spending_comparison`; `app/services/budget_variance_service.py:compute_variance` | Phase 3: for the same `(period, category)`, client tooltip `diff` must equal server-rendered variance value in `_variance.html`. Drift = E-17 finding |
| post-investment residual (`preRetirement - (pension + investment)`) | `retirement_gap_chart.js:24-25` | NOT directly computed server-side; server returns the three operands separately in `chart_data` (see `retirement_dashboard_service.py:237-244`) | This is INTENTIONAL by design: server computes the post-pension `gap` for the table, client computes the post-investment residual for the chart's stacking. Phase 3 verifies the visual stack adds up to `preRetirement` |

#### 1.4.x.3 Conditional on financial value (JS)

| ID | path:line | Branch condition | Behavior |
| -- | --------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| JC-01 | `app/static/js/chart_variance.js:25` | `val > estimated[i]` | per-bar color (overspend red vs under-budget green) |
| JC-02 | `app/static/js/chart_variance.js:70` | `diff >= 0` (sign of variance) | tooltip prefix `+$` vs `-$` |
| JC-03 | `app/static/js/chart_year_end.js:29` | `minVal >= 0` | chart fill color (positive vs negative net worth) |
| JC-04 | `app/static/js/retirement_gap_chart.js:22` | `preRetirement <= 0` | early return (no chart) |
| JC-05 | `app/static/js/retirement_gap_chart.js:45` | `remaining > 0` | gap bar color (coral if positive gap, green if zero) |
| JC-06 | `app/static/js/chart_slider.js:56` | `!isNaN(val)` | gate for clamping logic |
| JC-07 | `app/static/js/progress_bar.js:41, 46, 47` | `isFinite(pct)`; `pct < 0`; `pct > 100` | bounds-checking before applying as inline width |

#### 1.4.x.4 Non-financial arithmetic (transparency)

Recorded for completeness even though out of scope:

| ID | path:line | Expression | Operand class |
| -- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| JNF-01 | `app/static/js/debt_strategy.js:59` | `a.priority - b.priority` | sort comparator on Integer priority |
| JNF-02 | `app/static/js/app.js:465-466` | `Math.max(0, Math.min(row, rows.length - 1))` | row/col index clamping |
| JNF-03 | `app/static/js/grid_edit.js:54-77, 80-84` | viewport geometry: `viewportH - cellRect.bottom`, `cellRect.top - popoverHeight`, `viewportW - popoverWidth - POPOVER_VIEWPORT_MARGIN` | pixel coordinates |
| JNF-04 | `app/static/js/mobile_grid.js:53-57` | `e.changedTouches[0].clientX - touchStartX`; `Math.abs(dx) > 50` | touch coordinate delta |

#### 1.4.x.5 HTMX event listener catalogue

Per `app/static/js/*` reads, the JS layer registers listeners on these HTMX events; Phase 3 cares
because the listeners control when a financial render path actually fires:

| Event | Files | Behavior |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| `htmx:configRequest` | `app.js:55`, `debt_strategy.js:37` | CSRF token injection (app.js); priority serialization (debt_strategy.js) |
| `htmx:beforeRequest` | `app.js:63`, `grid_edit.js:576` | loading-class management; submitting flag |
| `htmx:afterRequest` | `app.js:75`, `grid_edit.js:583` | clear loading state |
| `htmx:afterSwap` | `app.js:78-119`, `chart_theme.js` (via subscription pattern); `chart_variance.js:97, 104`; `chart_year_end.js:89`; `chart_slider.js`; `retirement_gap_chart.js:86, 91`; `growth_chart.js:156, 162`; `payoff_chart.js:139, 144`; `debt_strategy.js:159`; `progress_bar.js:66`; `dashboard.js`; `mobile_grid.js` (indirect via app.js) | popover re-init; chart re-render after partial swap; progress-bar re-clamp; page-specific bindings |
| `htmx:afterSettle` | `calendar.js:9` | calendar day-click rebinding |
| `htmx:responseError` | `app.js:129` | error banner |
| custom `shekel:theme-changed` | `chart_theme.js` | chart palette re-render |
| custom `slider-changed` | `chart_slider.js` (emit), `retirement_gap_chart.js` (subscribe), `growth_chart.js` (subscribe) | slider-driven recompute fan-out |

No new vocabulary tokens are needed for the JS layer. Every JS-side concept maps onto an existing
controlled-vocabulary token.

## 1.7 Inventory deliverable wrap-up

Compiled in session P1-e on 2026-05-15. This section is the spine of Phase 2 (concept catalog) and
Phase 3 (consistency audit): the concept-to-locations index in 1.7.3 lets a Phase 2/3 session find
every producer and consumer for any controlled-vocabulary token in one greppable table. The QC
summary in 1.7.5 and caveats in 1.7.6 record the systematic risks Phase 3 must apply to any
inventory cell before treating it as a finding.

### 1.7.1 Headline counts

| Layer | Files inventoried | Files out of scope | Body entries |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| 1.1 Services | 36 | 4 (`auth_service.py`, `mfa_service.py`, `exceptions.py`, `__init__.py`) | 67+ public functions across three groups (A: 11 calc engines, B: 11 aggregation services, C: 14 workflow services) |
| 1.2 Routes | 16 | 7 (`__init__.py`, `auth.py`, `categories.py`, `charts.py`, `health.py`, `pay_periods.py`, `settings.py`) | 37 (Group A grid/transactional) + 36 (Group B account/loan) + 41 (Group C aggregation/analytics) = 114 route rows |
| 1.3 Templates | 56 | 50 (auth, errors, settings, base, navigation, form-only) | 56 per-template rows + cross-cutting (1.3.x.1: 11 arithmetic sites; 1.3.x.2: 4 `\|round` sites; 1.3.x.3: 20 conditional sites; 1.3.x.4: 8 filter sites; 1.3.x.5: 13 cross-page tokens) |
| 1.4 JS | 10 | 13 (DOM-only / password / non-financial forms) | 10 chart-JS rows + 3 orchestration rows + cross-cutting (1.4.x.1: 3 E-17 candidates + 3 borderline; 1.4.x.3: 7 conditionals; 1.4.x.4: 4 non-financial) |
| 1.5 Models | 24 | -- | 40 classes; 113 numeric columns; 6 `@property` accessors (5 on Transaction + 1 on Transfer + 1 on Category display_name + 1 on PayPeriod label) |
| 1.6 Aggregates | -- | -- | 5 SQLAlchemy `func.*` sites total; 2 are money aggregates (both in `year_end_summary_service._compute_envelope_breakdowns_aware` at lines 519 and 520-528); 3 are non-money (count, max, count) |

Total files inventoried across all layers: 142. Total files out of scope: 74. Total entry rows
(body): 67 services + 114 routes + 56 templates + 13 JS + 113 numeric columns + 5 aggregates = ~368
rows of structured inventory.

Total controlled-vocabulary tokens: 51 (42 from audit-plan Appendix A + 4 added in 1.1 / P1-b + 5
added in 1.2 / P1-c + 0 from P1-a sections 1.5/1.6 + 0 from P1-d sections 1.3/1.4).

### 1.7.2 Vocabulary additions beyond Appendix A

The starter set in Appendix A (audit plan section 12) covered every column-level concept in 1.5 and
the load-bearing concepts in 1.6, so P1-a added zero tokens. P1-d (templates and JS) added zero new
tokens because every Jinja or JS expression maps onto an existing token.

Additions from P1-b (section 1.1, services):

| Token | First introduced | Definition | Still in use? |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| `pension_benefit_annual` | `pension_calculator.py:31-66` (`PensionBenefit.annual_benefit` field on returned dataclass) | Annual defined-benefit pension amount in Decimal dollars produced by `pension_calculator.calculate_benefit`. | Yes; rendered at `retirement/dashboard.html:111`. |
| `pension_benefit_monthly` | `pension_calculator.py:65-66` | Monthly defined-benefit pension amount in Decimal dollars; consumed by `retirement_dashboard_service.compute_gap_data` and `retirement_gap_calculator.calculate_gap` (`monthly_pension_income` argument at `retirement_gap_calculator.py:39`). | Yes; rendered at `retirement/dashboard.html:118` and `_gap_analysis.html:15, 22`. |
| `loan_remaining_months` | `amortization_engine.py:128-176` (`calculate_remaining_months`) | Integer count of unfulfilled loan months; distinct from `payoff_date` because consumers display the count separately. Input to `calculate_monthly_payment`. | Yes; rendered at `loan/_refinance_results.html:51` and consumed by `debt_strategy/_results.html:67-70` (`total_months`). |
| `cash_runway_days` | `dashboard_service.py:375` (`_compute_cash_runway`) | Integer days of runway = `current_balance / daily_avg_paid_expenses` over a 30-day window; distinct from `emergency_fund_coverage_months` because input window and time unit differ. Phase 2 must decide whether to fold this into `emergency_fund_coverage_months`. | Yes; rendered at `dashboard/_balance_runway.html:21`. |

Additions from P1-c (section 1.2, routes):

| Token | First introduced | Definition | Still in use? |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------- |

Orphan vocabulary token (defined at top, never used in body):

| Token | Note |
| ----- | ---- |
| `loan_principal_displayed` | Defined at vocab line 33 (from audit-plan Appendix A) but used zero times in the body. Phase 2 may collapse this into `loan_principal_real` or `loan_principal_stored` depending on the resolution; A-04 already documents the dual policy and both tokens are in use. Recorded as an orphan rather than removed because Appendix A is the contract for the starter set. |

### 1.7.3 Concept-to-locations index

The table below sorts the controlled-vocabulary alphabetically and lists every layer where a
producer, consumer, or aggregate for that concept lives. Producer (1.1) and producer (1.5) columns
are split because Phase 4 (source-of-truth audit) needs to distinguish stored columns from computed
values. A `*` after the token name marks multi-path concepts (two or more producers OR two or more
consumers). Phase 3.1 reads the `*`-marked rows as required cross-comparison findings.

Notation:

- `svc:name@file:line` = function name plus citation in services.
- `route:name@file:line` = view function name plus citation in routes.
- Template citations name the template only (line ranges are in 1.3 tables).
- JS citations name the file only (sites are in 1.4 tables).
- Model citations name the class.column or class.property plus citation.
- `Aggregates` cites `year_end_summary_service.py:519, 520-528` only -- the two money SQL
  aggregates.

Sub-list: orphans by category.

Tokens with producers but no consumers (the implementation runs but no page or chart consumes the
result): none after the index pass. Phase 2 should treat this as a load-bearing finding -- every
concept that the code computes is read somewhere.

Tokens with consumers but no producers (a render path reads a value no service produces): only
`transfer_amount_computed`, which is intentional (route-resident derivation; no service exists for
it, which is itself an SRP candidate per Q-12).

Tokens with neither producers nor consumers (purely orphan in the inventory):
`loan_principal_displayed` only, per 1.7.2.

### 1.7.4 Multi-path concepts requiring Phase 3 comparison

Multi-path concepts are tokens with two or more producers OR two or more consumers. Per audit plan
section 3.1, every multi-path concept becomes a required Phase 3 finding. The list below is derived
mechanically from the `*`-marked rows in 1.7.3.

Tier-1 concepts (3+ producers AND 3+ consumers; highest blast radius because divergence between any
pair propagates broadly):

- `account_balance` -- 7 service producers, 6 route consumers, 10 template render sites. Phase 3.1
  explicit comparison required: grid vs accounts vs savings vs dashboard vs investment for the same
  `(user_id, period_id, scenario_id)`. Anchor of the developer's reported symptom #5 (`/accounts` vs
  other pages divergence).
- `effective_amount` -- 13 service producers (incl. `Transaction.effective_amount` property and
  seven hand-rolled mirrors), every cell-render route, 8 template render sites, plus the only two
  money SQL aggregates (1.6). Phase 3.1 must cross-check every `actual_amount`/`estimated_amount`
  direct read against the property semantics (4-tier branching: `is_deleted`,
  `status.excludes_from_balance`, `actual_amount`, `estimated_amount`).
- `monthly_payment` -- 10 service producers including 14 `calculate_monthly_payment` call sites
  (A-05 lists 8; P1-b's grep found 6 more in adjacent fallback branches per Q-09), 7 route
  consumers, 11 template render sites. Phase 3.1 must verify all 14 call sites receive the same
  `(current_principal, current_rate, remaining_months)` triple for the same loan-on-date (E-02 ARM
  stability invariant).
- `period_subtotal` -- 10 service producers, 6 route consumers (including Q-10 grid inline @263-279
  and Q-12 obligations Q-12 inline @331-408), 6 template render sites, plus `chart_variance.js:69`
  (E-17 candidate JN-03). Phase 3.1 must compare grid subtotals against dashboard's
  `_compute_spending_comparison` and variance/calendar/obligations for the same period.

Tier-2 concepts (2 producers and/or 2 consumers; routine multi-path):

- `apy_interest` -- 4 producers, 1 route, 2 templates. Single-page comparison:
  `accounts/interest_detail.html` vs `savings/dashboard.html`.
- `chart_balance_series` -- 6 producers across engines, 7 route consumers, 6+ template/JS consumers.
  Phase 3 must verify the array each chart receives matches the server-computed balance series at
  the same time points.
- `debt_total` -- 6 producers (3 services + 3 specialized), 3 routes, 3 templates. Compare
  `_debt_summary` widget on dashboard vs savings card vs debt_strategy.
- `dti_ratio` -- 2 producers, 2 routes, 2 templates. Compare dashboard vs savings for same user.
- `employer_contribution` -- 7 producers, 1 route, 1 template. Single-consumer; the producer
  multiplicity is what Phase 3 checks (does `growth_engine.calculate_employer_contribution` agree
  with `paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck`'s employer line).
- `entry_remaining` -- 5 producers, 4 routes, 5 templates. Q-08 hinges here: should settled
  transactions use `actual_amount` or `estimated_amount` for over-budget display? Phase 3 verifies
  template subtractions match `compute_remaining`.
- `entry_sum_total` -- 3 producers, 3 routes, 4 templates, plus the one money SQL aggregate (1.6).
  Phase 3 verifies that envelope SQL sum matches per-template entry sum.
- `escrow_per_period` -- 6 producers, 4 routes, 5 templates. A-06 anchor (escrow subtraction
  preprocessing); Phase 3 verifies the dashboard escrow display matches the schedule's escrow
  attribution.
- `federal_tax` -- 8 producers, 7 routes, 5 templates. Calibration vs bracket-based paths split
  (Q-13 inline taxable derivation); Phase 3 verifies both paths produce the same `federal_tax` for
  the same inputs.
- `fica` -- 5 producers, 6 routes, 4 templates. Same calibration/bracket split.
- `goal_progress` -- 6 producers, 4 routes, 4 templates. Compare dashboard savings widget vs
  `/savings` panel vs companion `pct` inline (`companion.py:53-56`).
- `growth` -- 9 producers, 6 routes, 5 templates. Wide concept (return rate, inflation, raise
  growth, trend pct); Phase 3 must distinguish sub-concepts before comparing.
- `interest_paid_per_period` -- 5 producers, 3 routes, 3 templates. Compare schedule rows vs
  year-end mortgage interest aggregate (A-06).
- `interest_saved` -- 2 producers, 3 routes, 3 templates. Compare amortization payoff results vs
  debt strategy results for the same loan.
- `loan_principal_real` -- 6 producers, 5 routes, 5 templates. A-04 dual policy anchor; Phase 3
  cross-checks every page that displays principal (`/accounts/<id>/loan` vs refinance vs debt
  strategy).
- `loan_principal_stored` -- 6 producers, 4 routes, 3 templates. A-04 ARM anchor; cross-page
  consistency for ARM stored vs displayed.
- `paycheck_breakdown` -- 3 producers, 6 routes, 5 templates. Compare list_profiles vs breakdown vs
  projection vs calibrate flows for the same profile and period.
- `paycheck_gross` -- 5 producers, 7 routes, 5 templates. Raise sequencing (`_apply_raises`) is the
  largest variance source; Phase 3 verifies the same gross is produced by every entry path for the
  same profile on the same date.
- `paycheck_net` -- 4 producers, 4 routes, 5 templates. End-of-pipeline; should match across all
  rendering sites if intermediate concepts agree.
- `payoff_date` -- 5 producers, 4 routes, 4 templates. Compare loan dashboard vs payoff results vs
  refinance vs debt strategy.
- `principal_paid_per_period` -- 4 producers, 3 routes, 4 templates. Schedule consistency check.
- `projected_end_balance` -- 6 producers, 7 routes, 7 templates + 3 JS render paths. E-04 invariant
  anchor; same-number-on-every-page requirement.
- `savings_total` -- 3 producers, 4 routes, 3 templates. Compare savings dashboard vs retirement gap
  vs year-end summary.
- `taxable_income` -- 6 producers, 4 routes, 2 templates. Q-13 anchor (route-inline vs
  breakdown.taxable_income).
- `total_interest` -- 5 producers, 5 routes, 4 templates. Compare amortization vs year-end vs debt
  strategy.
- `transfer_amount` -- 8 producers, 7 routes, 3 templates. Compare `Transfer.amount` stored vs
  `transfer_service` mutations vs year-end summary.

Single-path tokens (1 producer AND 1 consumer; lowest risk; Phase 3 only verifies the cited site is
correct internally):

- `cash_runway_days`, `checking_balance` (functions as alias for account_balance in most contexts;
  Phase 3 must verify this aliasing is intentional), `chart_date_labels` (always parallel to
  chart_balance_series), `contribution_limit_remaining`, `emergency_fund_coverage_months`,
  `loan_remaining_months`, `months_saved`, `net_worth`, `pension_benefit_annual`,
  `pension_benefit_monthly`, `post_tax_deduction`, `pre_tax_deduction`, `state_tax`,
  `transfer_amount_computed`, `year_summary_*` family (each token is a single producer feeding a
  single route).

### 1.7.5 QC summary across Phase 1 sessions

| Session | Layers | QC logged? | Sample size | Failures | Re-dispatches | Notes |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- | ----- |
| P1-a | 1.5 + 1.6 | informal | per-column read | none recorded | 0 | Sessions preceded the formal QC protocol; the column-by-column inventory pattern is mechanical and produced no agent-classification ambiguity (113 numeric columns + 6 `@property` accessors). |
| P1-b | 1.1 | informal | ~15 cited-line spot-checks against the largest two files (`year_end_summary_service.py` 2248 lines; `savings_dashboard_service.py` 956 lines) | ~20% line-citation drift in `year_end_summary_service.py` body citations; ~5% in `savings_dashboard_service.py` | 0 (corrected inline) | Self-review captured in section 1.1 "Citation-quality note" with verified/unverified split. Function-definition lines reliable everywhere; body-line citations were re-verified at all load-bearing sites (A-02 through A-07, money SQL aggregates, transfer-shadow guards, eight A-05 monthly-payment sites and six additional sites). |
| P1-c | 1.2 | yes | 45 (15 per Group A/B/C, 8+ from files >800 LOC) | 0 line-drift outside +/-2 tolerance; 3 inline-classification fixes (grid.py:164 Inline=YES, transactions.py:909/987 Inline=NO); 1 scope misclassification (`dashboard.mark_paid` originally out-of-scope, re-classified IN scope) | 0 | Systematic off-by-1 in 3 of 45 samples on decorator-line citations in `retirement.py`, `salary.py`, `templates.py` (Phase 3 should treat route-layer citations as range `[cited-1, cited+2]`). |
| P1-d | 1.3 + 1.4 | yes | 16 (templates) + 15 (JS) = 31 samples; both biased toward "arithmetic-YES" / "numeric-work-YES" rows | Templates: 4/16 = 25% classification misses; numeric-work-YES subsample 3/8 = 38%. JS: 3/15 = 20%; numeric-YES subsample 3/8 = 38%. All misses fall into a single systematic over-flagging class (comparisons and bounds-checks classified as arithmetic) | 0 (corrected inline with explicit rationale at sections 1.3.0 and 1.4.0) | Systematic-error class documented (Explore over-flags `{% if value > 0 %}` and bounds-checking conditionals as arithmetic). After correction, the actual arithmetic-in-Jinja count drops from 13 to 11, and JS E-17 candidates drop from 7 (including borderlines) to 3 strict + 3 borderline. |
| P1-e | 1.7 wrap-up | n/a | inventory consistency audit only (Task 1: orphan token, QC-asymmetry, cross-references); index spot-checks per 1.7.5 verification | 1 orphan vocabulary token (`loan_principal_displayed`); zero body tokens missing from vocab; zero duplicate entries | 0 | This session does not produce new layer content; it produces 1.7.1 through 1.7.6. Spot-check verification recorded in 1.7.7. |
| P1-f | 1.1 re-verify (arithmetic classification only) | yes | 29 HIGH-RISK rows source-read exhaustively + 15 LOW-RISK engine rows sampled = 44 of ~84 candidates verified against actual source | HIGH-RISK: 6/29 (~21%) reclassified non-arithmetic (`dashboard_service._compute_alerts`/`_get_balance_info`, `budget_variance_service._compute_actual`, `calendar_service._build_day_entry`/`_compute_month_end_balance`, `year_end_summary_service.py:1465-1469` ARM anchor); 1/29 borderline KEPT+flagged (`retirement_dashboard_service.compute_slider_defaults` SWR `* _PCT_SCALE`). LOW-RISK: 0/15 fail (partition accepted, not promoted). | 0 (corrected inline per affected file) | Section 1.1 has no discrete arithmetic column; the P1-d error class manifests here as concept-token **producer over-attribution** (compare/read/delegate functions listed as money-token producers). Caveat 1.7.6 (1)'s named suspect `amount_to_monthly` verified GENUINE arithmetic. year_end cross-check (caveat 1.7.6 (2)): 380/414/475/636/824 def-lines EXACT and in P1-b verified list; 518-528 range loose by 1 (518 is `func.count`); 1465-1469 line numbers OK but enclosing-fn mis-attributed (`_balance_from_schedule_at_date` -> actually `_generate_debt_schedules`@1421); 824 signature-column drift. Full log at 1.7.8. |

### 1.7.6 Known caveats for Phase 2 and Phase 3 consumers

Phase-2 and Phase-3 sessions reading this inventory should be aware of these caveats before drawing
structural conclusions.

1. **Systematic over-flagging of comparisons / reads as
   arithmetic (P1-d affected; P1-b section 1.1 RE-VERIFIED by
   P1-f 2026-05-15).** Explore-T (templates) and Explore-J (JS)
   over-flagged `{% if value > 0 %}` conditionals, `|abs` /
   `|min` / `|max` filters, `.toFixed()`-style formatting, and
   bounds-checking conditionals as arithmetic; P1-d corrected
   these inline (sections 1.3.x.3 / 1.4.x.3 / 1.3.x.4;
   systematic-error class at 1.3.0 and 1.4.0). The open question
   was whether P1-b's section 1.1 carried the same class.
   **Resolved by P1-f.** Section 1.1 has NO discrete arithmetic
   column (unlike 1.3.x/1.4.x); its implicit "performs
   arithmetic" classification is the concept-token producer
   attribution plus the "What it does" framing, so the error
   class manifests as concept-token **producer over-attribution**
   -- functions that only compare, read, or delegate listed as
   producers of money/balance tokens. P1-f source-read all 29
   HIGH-RISK suspect rows (suspect-named functions plus every
   computational row in the display/aggregation files) and
   sampled 15 LOW-RISK calculation-engine rows. Result:
   false-positive rate **6/29 (~21%) in the HIGH-RISK suspect
   partition, 0/15 in the LOW-RISK engine partition**. The six
   false positives -- `dashboard_service._compute_alerts` and
   `_get_balance_info`, `budget_variance_service._compute_actual`,
   `calendar_service._build_day_entry` and
   `_compute_month_end_balance`, and the
   `year_end_summary_service.py:1465-1469` ARM anchor -- were
   relocated inline to per-file "Conditional on financial value"
   / "Non-arithmetic" lists with original citations preserved.
   One borderline (`retirement_dashboard_service.compute_slider_defaults`,
   SWR `* _PCT_SCALE` rate-to-percentage display) is KEPT as
   arithmetic with an inline Phase-3-adjudication flag. The
   suspect specifically named in the prior version of this caveat,
   `amount_to_monthly`, was verified to be GENUINE money
   arithmetic (multiply/divide of a money amount), NOT a false
   positive. **Phase 3 instruction (changed):** Phase 3 MAY rely
   on the section 1.1 arithmetic classification as re-verified by
   P1-f rather than re-applying the rules from scratch. Residual
   risk: the LOW-RISK calculation-engine partition was
   sample-verified (0 failures in 15 of ~55 rows; the strict
   accept threshold of 0-1 was met so full re-verification was
   not triggered) -- a Phase 3 finding that turns on a LOW-RISK
   engine row's exact body citation should still spot-check that
   one row. Borderline rows flagged inline still require Phase 3
   adjudication.

2. **QC asymmetry: P1-a and P1-b preceded the formal QC protocol
   introduced in P1-c.** Their line-citation accuracy is uneven:
   P1-a's column-level inventory is mechanical and reliable; P1-b's
   function-definition citations are reliable everywhere, but
   body-line citations in `year_end_summary_service.py` (2248 lines)
   had a ~20% spot-check error rate that was corrected in the
   P1-b self-review. Phase 3 should spot-check any P1-b row before
   quoting its body-line citation as evidence in a finding, and
   should explicitly verify any body citation in
   `year_end_summary_service.py` that was NOT listed in P1-b's
   verified citations sub-list at the end of section 1.1.
   **P1-f fold-in (2026-05-15):** P1-f re-checked every
   arithmetic-classified `year_end_summary_service.py` row against
   source. Def-line citations `:380`, `:414`, `:475`, `:636`,
   `:824` are EXACT (0 drift) and were already in P1-b's verified
   sub-list. Three residual citation-quality issues, all recorded
   inline in the file's P1-f block: (a) the `:518-528` SQL-aggregate
   range is loose by one line -- 518 is `db.func.count`, the two
   money sums are precisely 519 and 520-528; (b) the `:1465-1469`
   ARM anchor has accurate line numbers but is attributed to
   `_balance_from_schedule_at_date` when the enclosing def is
   `_generate_debt_schedules` (line 1421); (c) `_compute_debt_progress`
   `:824` has a Signature-column drift (actual signature
   `(year, debt_accounts, debt_schedules, ...)`). Phase 3 should
   trust the line numbers over the function-name attribution for
   the ARM anchor.

3. **Cross-reference completeness across sections.** Sections 1.2,
   1.3, and 1.4 cite their upstream entries by name and file:line
   (route -> service, template -> route, JS -> service/route).
   Sections 1.5 and 1.6 stand alone -- downstream sections do not
   always cite back to specific model columns or aggregate sites.
   Phase 2 should walk concept tokens from sections 1.1-1.4 back to
   the 1.5 columns and 1.6 aggregates that underlie them; the
   1.7.3 index makes this walk straightforward.

4. **Resolved Phase-0 questions (A-01 through A-07 in
   `00_priors.md`).** These define behavioral expectations the
   inventory documents but does not enforce. For example:
   - A-01 (canonical rounding rule) is verified per-function in
     the 1.1 quantization column; Phase 3 must check the
     boundary-quantize claim at every consumer site, not just at
     the producer.
   - A-02 (carry-forward envelope settle-and-roll) is verified at
     the service level; Phase 3 must verify that no other branch
     (discrete, transfer, manual) accidentally invokes
     `_settle_source_and_roll_leftover` semantics.
   - A-04 (ARM stored vs fixed-rate engine-walked principal) is
     verified in `amortization_engine.py:977-985`; Phase 3 must
     cross-check every page that displays principal (six pages
     listed in `loan_principal_real` / `loan_principal_stored`
     rows of the 1.7.3 index).
   - A-05 (eight monthly_payment call sites) is expanded to
     fourteen by P1-b's grep; six additional sites in adjacent
     fallback branches (Q-09 question). Phase 3 must verify the
     invariant against all fourteen, with the six fallback-branch
     sites separately scrutinized.
   - A-06 (year-end mortgage interest pipeline) is verified across
     `loan_payment_service.py:263-353` (preprocessing) and
     `year_end_summary_service.py:380-408` (aggregation).
   - A-07 (carry-forward three-branch partition) is verified in
     `carry_forward_service.py:273-277` and the bulk-update
     pattern at lines 405-437; Phase 3 must verify each branch's
     output matches the expectations documented in
     `prod_readiness_v1` (discrete) and `carry_fwd_impl`
     (envelope).

5. **Q-NN open questions raised by Phase 1.** Q-08 (P1-b),
   Q-09 (P1-b), Q-10 through Q-14 (P1-c) are awaiting developer
   answers before Phase 3 can adjudicate the relevant findings.
   Phase 2 (concept catalog) should explicitly note in each
   concept's primary-path entry that the answer to the question
   determines which implementation is canonical. The questions
   are filed in `09_open_questions.md`.

### 1.7.7 P1-e verification spot-checks

Per the prompt's verification protocol, five concept-to-locations index rows were sampled at random
and re-verified by Read against the cited file:line. Results:

| # | Token sampled | Citation checked | Verdict |
| - | ------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| 1 | `monthly_payment` | `calculate_monthly_payment`@`amortization_engine.py:178` | OK (function definition at line 178 per P1-b verified-citations sub-list at end of section 1.1). |
| 2 | `effective_amount` | `Transaction.effective_amount`@`transaction.py:221-245` | OK (P1-a section 1.5 cites the same range; property body at lines 221-245). |
| 3 | `escrow_per_period` | `calculate_monthly_escrow`@`escrow_calculator.py:14` | OK (P1-b Group A inventory at the file-defined function table). |
| 4 | `period_subtotal` inline | `index`@`grid.py:164` subtotal loop @263-279 | OK (Q-10 cites the same range; P1-c QC log inline correction confirmed the inline arithmetic). |
| 5 | `paycheck_breakdown` | `calculate_paycheck`@`paycheck_calculator.py:92` | OK (P1-b Group A inventory and P1-c route consumers all align). |

Greppability spot-check: every controlled-vocabulary token from 1.7.2 plus the index in 1.7.3 was
confirmed grep-able in this file (`grep -c <token>`); the orphan `loan_principal_displayed` returns
exactly one hit (its definition line). No body token uses a name that isn't in the vocabulary.

Phase 1 is complete after this section is written. The output file is `01_inventory.md`. Phase 2
(concept catalog) begins in a separate session with this file as primary input; the caveats in 1.7.6
are required reading.

### 1.7.8 P1-f arithmetic re-verification QC log

(The session prompt named this subsection "1.7.7"; 1.7.7 was already written by
P1-e for its verification spot-checks, so the P1-f log is filed as 1.7.8 to
avoid clobbering P1-e content. The numbering is the only deviation.)

Session P1-f, 2026-05-15. Single purpose: re-verify the "performs arithmetic on
financial values" classification in section 1.1 (Services), correcting the
systematic over-flagging documented in caveat 1.7.6 (1), and folding in the
`year_end_summary_service.py` line-drift cross-check from caveat 1.7.6 (2).
Read-only audit; source files, tests, and migrations untouched.

**Structural note (material -- read before consuming this log).** Section 1.1
does NOT have a discrete "Arithmetic (YES/NO)" column the way sections 1.3.x
(`Arithmetic in Jinja`) and 1.4.x (`Numeric work`) do. Its columns are
`file:line | Signature | Returns | What it does | Concept token(s) | ... |
Quantization | Calls`. The "classification that marks a row as performing
arithmetic on financial values" was therefore operationalised as: **the row's
`What it does` description asserts the function itself performs an arithmetic
operation (sum, subtract, multiply, divide, formula, accrue, convert-by-factor)
producing/transforming a financial concept token, AND/OR the 1.7.3 index lists
the function as a `svc:` producer of a money/rate token.** Pure
query/lookup/CRUD/state/date/log/resolver rows with concept token `-` and
structural descriptions were treated as never-classified-as-arithmetic and left
out of scope (per the scope guardrail forbidding re-classification of
non-arithmetic rows). Consequence: the P1-d error class manifests in 1.1 not as
a binary-column over-flag but as **concept-token producer over-attribution** --
a function that only compares / reads / delegates is listed (in the per-file
table's token column and in the 1.7.3 producer column) as a producer of a
money/balance token. That is the section-1.1 analogue of P1-d's
"comparison-flagged-as-arithmetic" and is exactly what the six relocations
below correct. This operational definition is the honest adaptation of the
task to 1.1's actual structure; Phase 3 should read the relocations with it in
mind.

**Candidate set.** ~84 rows (per-file table rows the inventory frames as the
function itself computing a financial value; pure delegators/orchestrators with
"delegates"/"assembles" descriptions and structural `-`-token rows excluded as
never-classified-as-arithmetic). Partitioned per the prompt's risk rule.

| Partition | Rows | Verified how | False positives | Borderline kept+flagged | year_end line/attribution fixes | Action |
| --------- | ---- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------ |
| HIGH-RISK (suspect-named fns + every computational row in `dashboard_service`, `savings_dashboard_service`, `retirement_dashboard_service`, `year_end_summary_service`, `budget_variance_service`, `calendar_service`, `spending_trend_service`, plus the `carry_forward` decision-tree guard and `calibration.derive_effective_rates`) | 29 | Exhaustive: every cited `file:line` read at source with a +/-6 window (<=40 rows, so no Explore raw-fetch needed) and the prompt's rule table applied mechanically | 6 (`dashboard_service._compute_alerts` @252, `_get_balance_info` @334; `budget_variance_service._compute_actual` @381; `calendar_service._build_day_entry` @240, `_compute_month_end_balance` @435; `year_end_summary_service` ARM anchor @1465-1469) | 1 (`retirement_dashboard_service.compute_slider_defaults` @257 -- genuine balance-weighted average KEPT; SWR `* _PCT_SCALE` percentage-display flagged) | 3 recorded (518-528 range loose by 1; 1465-1469 enclosing-fn mis-attributed to `_balance_from_schedule_at_date`, actual `_generate_debt_schedules`@1421; 824 signature-column drift). Def-lines 380/414/475/636/824 EXACT and in P1-b verified list. | Relocated the 6 false positives inline to per-file "Conditional on financial value" / "Non-arithmetic" lists with original citations preserved; flagged the 1 borderline inline; recorded the year_end citation-quality issues in the file's P1-f block and folded into caveat 1.7.6 (2). |
| LOW-RISK (recognised calculators in `amortization_engine`, `growth_engine`, `interest_projection`, `tax_calculator`, `paycheck_calculator`, `loan_payment_service`, `balance_calculator`, plus `debt_strategy`, `savings_goal` recognised calcs and Group C entry/settle sum helpers) | ~55 | Sampled 15 spanning every engine file (incl. all section-1.1 `calculate_monthly_payment` sites for the Task-4 completeness check), read at source, rule table applied | 0/15 | 0 | n/a | Accepted as correctly classified (strict threshold 0-1 met); partition NOT promoted to exhaustive. A Phase 3 finding turning on a LOW-RISK engine row's exact body citation should still spot-check that one row (residual recorded in caveat 1.7.6 (1)). |

`actual_amount` / `estimated_amount`, no operator);
`calendar_service.py:240` `_build_day_entry` (`amount = effective_amount`
read, `abs(amount) >= threshold` bare-abs + compare);
`calendar_service.py:435` `_compute_month_end_balance` (period lookup +
`calculate_balances` delegate + dict read);
`year_end_summary_service.py:1465-1469` ARM anchor (`Decimal(str(
params.current_principal)) if params.is_arm else None` -- type-normalize +
conditional anchor read per A-04). True-negative confirmed clean (was already
framed as a read, no relocation): `dashboard_service.py:167` `txn_to_bill_dict`.

**Task 4 -- monthly_payment completeness (the only false-negative check).**
A-05/Q-09's call-site set, restricted to section 1.1's scope: definition
`amortization_engine.py:178` (annuity formula `principal * (monthly_rate *
factor) / (factor - 1)` at line 196 -- genuine), and the service-layer call
sites `:436, :440, :491, :512` (in `generate_schedule`@326), `:693, :697` (in
`calculate_summary`@649), `:952, :957` (in `get_loan_projection`@864),
`balance_calculator.py:225, :231` (in `calculate_balances_with_amortization`@176),
`loan_payment_service.py:251, :256` (in `compute_contractual_pi`@233). All were
source-confirmed present and enclosed by functions classified as arithmetic;
none were wrongly dropped by the systematic bias. The remaining A-05/Q-09 sites
(`app/routes/loan.py:1102, 1225, 1231`) are section 1.2 and out of this
session's scope. No Q-09-linked finding: the bias did not drop a real
monthly_payment site from the 1.1 arithmetic classification.

**Verification before declaring complete.** (a) Re-grepped section 1.1; five
remaining arithmetic rows spot-re-read at random -- `amortization_engine.py:178`
(annuity, op present), `balance_calculator.py:292` `_entry_aware_amount`
(`estimated_amount - cleared_debit - sum_credit` inside `max`, 383-385, op
present), `tax_calculator.py:173` `_apply_marginal_brackets` (`total_tax +=
amount_in_bracket * rate`, 207, op present), `paycheck_calculator.py:329`
`_apply_single_raise` (`salary * (1 + pct)`, 333, op present),
`growth_engine.py:91` `calculate_employer_contribution` (`gross * pct`, 114, op
present) -- all genuinely contain an arithmetic operator on a financial value
per the rule table. (b) Every relocated row retains its original `file:line`
citation in its new per-file list. (c) The 14 (A-05/Q-09) monthly_payment
sites: the 12 in section-1.1 scope all resolve to an arithmetic classification;
the 3 route sites are section 1.2 (out of scope) -- no finding. (d) `wc -l`
confirms `01_inventory.md` changed (3012 -> 3313 lines).

No new behavioral ambiguity (Q-NN) surfaced: every P1-f decision was a
classification call against the rule table, not a "what is this code intended
to do" question. The one structural ambiguity (section 1.1 has no arithmetic
column) is a property of the audit document, not the codebase, and is resolved
above by the documented operational definition rather than a developer
question.

Phase 1 remains complete. P1-f is a post-Phase-1 remediation of section 1.1's
arithmetic classification only; Phase 2 begins in a separate session with this
file as primary input and the updated caveats in 1.7.6 as required reading.

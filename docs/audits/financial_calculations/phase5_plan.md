# Phase 5 Execution Plan -- Symptom-Driven Investigation

Meta-plan for executing Phase 5 of the financial-calculation audit. This file is
the launch script: each session below is started by pasting its section verbatim
plus the anti-shortcut prompt. This file is a planning artifact, not a phase
output and not source code. The phase output is `05_symptoms.md`.

Authoritative spec: `financial_calculation_audit_plan.md` section 5 (lines
564-612) and section 10 (how to run). This file does not override the audit
plan; it sequences it and binds the trust-but-verify contract the developer
requires.

## 0. Why Phase 5 is different now

Every open question Phases 3 and 4 stopped on (Q-08..Q-26) was answered by the
developer 2026-05-18 and recorded as behavioral expectations E-18..E-28 in
`00_priors.md` 0.3 (matching A-08..A-26 in `09_open_questions.md`). Phase 3's
own reconciliation states Phase 5 may consume `03_consistency.md` "with every
UNKNOWN-Q axis resolved."

Consequence: Phase 5 does not stop and ask. For every symptom branch the
intended behavior is fixed by a locked E-NN. Phase 5 roots each symptom against
that resolved intent and states a remediation direction. The only items Phase 5
may add to `09_open_questions.md` are genuinely new ambiguities discovered while
tracing -- not the already-answered Q-08..Q-26, and not auditor-invented
"obvious" expectations (audit-plan 0.3 prohibition still holds).

One tail item is explicitly out of symptom scope and must be carried, not
dropped: A-26 notes E-18 does not decide the `auth.user_settings.
estimated_retirement_tax_rate` NULL-semantics contract. It touches no balance or
loan symptom; P5-d records it as out-of-scope-carried so it is not silently
lost.

## 1. Inherited spine (hypotheses to falsify, not scaffolding)

Phase 3 C2 (`03_consistency.md:6049-6060`) and Phase 4 Deliverable 4
(`04_source_of_truth.md:2129-2146`) assert this symptom -> root-cause map. The
developer has directed **independent re-derivation**: Phase 5 builds each tree
from source first and only then compares to this table. A mismatch is a Phase 5
finding against the prior phase, surfaced, not smoothed.

| Symptom | Asserted root cause | Resolved intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1 $160 grid vs $114.29 /savings, same current period | F-009 (+ W-277 calendar, same defect, new page) | E-25 / E-19 / E-27 |
| #2 $1911.54 / $1914.34 / $1912.94 -> $1910.95 | F-013 (16-site incompatible (P,r,n) triples) | E-18 |
| #3 current_principal not moving as transfers settle | F-014 (zero settle-writer; settle modules never import LoanParams) | E-18 |
| #4 5/5 ARM payment creep inside fixed window | F-026 (frozen stored principal re-amortized over shrinking remaining; arm_first_adjustment_months consumed by zero calc sites) | E-18 |
| #5 /accounts matches nowhere else | F-001 + F-008 (unlabeled per-page base divergence) | E-18 / E-19 |

Symptoms #2/#3/#4 are asserted to collapse onto one un-maintained column
(`current_principal`). Phase 5 must independently re-prove that collapse from
source or reject it.

## 2. The trust-but-verify contract (binds every Phase 5 session)

1. Every node in every hypothesis tree cites `file:line` Read at source during
   the Phase 5 session. Phase 3/4 line citations are re-opened and re-read, not
   quoted. Recall from memory is not evidence; `grep`/`glob`/full-file Read is.
2. Every worked example (the $160/$114.29 gap; the $1911.54 -> $1910.95
   sequence; the ARM month-over-month creep; the symptom-#5 per-page spread) is
   recomputed by hand from the arithmetic the code actually executes, with the
   intermediate Decimal steps shown. Copying a number from C2 is not
   recomputation.
3. The C2 map and the drift register are falsifiable hypotheses. If an
   independent backward trace lands on a different or additional root cause, the
   divergence from the prior phase is itself recorded in `05_symptoms.md`.
4. P5-d runs a Gate-B-style spot-check: >= 15 cited claims drawn at random from
   the three symptom slices, each re-resolved to the expected code; the table
   and pass count are shown.
5. Any tree branch where no Phase-3 finding applies is listed as
   re-investigation (audit-plan 5). This is how Phase 5 audits Phase 3's
   completeness; it is not a defect to hide.
6. Read-only. Plan permission mode. No app run, no code/test/migration/template/
   JS edit. Output is `05_symptoms.md` only; `git status` must show only
   `docs/audits/financial_calculations/` at every session end.

## 3. Per-symptom finding schema (audit-plan 5, with the contract additions)

Each symptom subsection in `05_symptoms.md` contains, in order:

- **Symptom** -- the developer's own words (from audit-plan 5 lines 592-611).
- **Reproduction path** -- page, the user input, the account/period that
  exhibits it.
- **Hypothesis tree** -- numbered (or indented) backward walk from the displayed
  value: each node = the value, the file:line that produced it (Read this
  session), its inputs, and the transformation. Not prose.
- **Per-branch finding linkage** -- each branch tagged with the Phase-3
  F-ID(s) that govern it, or `NO-FINDING -> RE-INVESTIGATE` with a one-line
  reason.
- **Worked example** -- concrete inputs, every Decimal step, the divergent
  outputs, hand-computed this session.
- **Best-evidence root cause** -- the combination of findings that most likely
  explains the symptom, stated as a cited hypothesis (not a verdict), against
  the resolved intent (the governing E-NN) with the remediation direction the
  E-NN already fixes.
- **Independent-vs-inherited note** -- whether the independent trace confirms,
  narrows, or contradicts the C2 / drift-register assertion for this symptom.
- **Verification plan** -- the queries, code reads, and hand computations that
  would confirm or reject the root cause. Documentation only; nothing is run.

## 4. Sessions

One symptom-family per session. `/clear` between sessions. Each session's
required reading is line-range-bounded to prevent the infinite-exploration /
context-blowout failure mode; read the live `app/` source in full for any
function before drawing a conclusion about it (CLAUDE.md rule 2; audit-plan hard
rule 3).

### P5-a -- Symptom #1 (checking balance: $160 grid vs $114.29 /savings)

Goal: backward tree from both displayed numbers to the divergent producer;
hand-derive the gap; fold in W-277 (calendar month-end, asserted same defect on
a new consuming page).

Required reading (bounded):
- `financial_calculation_audit_plan.md:564-612` (Phase 5 spec); `:592-611`
  (symptom #1 wording).
- `00_priors.md:198-213` (E-19), `:276-311` (E-25, E-27).
- `03_consistency.md:214-340` (F-002, F-003), `:649-726` (F-009),
  `:6049-6060` (C2), `:6162-6204` (Q-answer reconciliation).
- `04_source_of_truth.md:35-295` (Family A anchor), `:2129-2146` (drift row #1).
- `09_open_questions.md` Q-16/A-16 and Q-20/A-20 (anchor-None resolution).
- Live source, Read in full: the entries-`selectinload` site and balance call in
  `app/routes/grid.py`; `app/services/savings_dashboard_service.py` checking
  path; `app/services/balance_calculator.py` `_sum_remaining` / `_sum_all` /
  `_entry_aware_amount` / `effective_amount` branch; `app/services/
  calendar_service.py` month-end path (W-277).

Stop condition: symptom #1 subsection written to `05_symptoms.md` with the gap
hand-recomputed; session ends.

### P5-b -- Symptoms #2 + #3 + #4 (the one loan-resolver family)

Kept in one session deliberately: #2/#3/#4 are asserted to share a single root
column; splitting them fractures the shared proof. Independently re-prove (or
reject) the collapse.

Required reading (bounded):
- `financial_calculation_audit_plan.md:592-611` (symptoms #2/#3/#4 wording).
- `00_priors.md:184-197` (E-18).
- `03_consistency.md:1009-1149` (F-013), `:1150-1359` (F-014, F-015, F-016),
  `:1936-2039` (F-026), `:6049-6060` (C2 rows #2/#3/#4).
- `04_source_of_truth.md:296-743` (Family B principal incl. settle-update trace
  `:489-587` and the fixed-rate worked example `:588-655`), `:744-1320`
  (Family B rate/escrow incl. the ARM crux `:1028-1112` and the ARM worked
  example `:1113-1159`), `:2129-2146` (drift rows #2/#3/#4).
- `09_open_questions.md` Q-17/A-17, Q-22/A-22, Q-23/A-23 (the one
  stored-mirror-maintenance policy resolved by E-18).
- Live source, Read in full: `app/services/amortization_engine.py`
  (`get_loan_projection`, `calculate_monthly_payment`,
  `calculate_remaining_months`, the ARM branch); `app/routes/loan.py`
  (`dashboard`, `update_params`); `app/routes/debt_strategy.py`;
  `app/services/savings_dashboard_service.py` debt path. Grep-prove from source
  that no settle / transfer / recurrence / status-transition module imports
  `LoanParams` (the zero-settle-writer claim).

Stop condition: #2, #3, #4 subsections written, each with its own
hand-recomputed worked example (the triple divergence; the un-maintained-column
trace; the month-over-month ARM creep), plus an explicit statement of whether
the three collapse onto one column; session ends.

### P5-c -- Symptom #5 (/accounts matches nothing) + cross-symptom synthesis

Depends on P5-a (checking/anchor base) and P5-b (loan base). One concrete
`(user, period, scenario, account)` carried across every balance producer to
show the unlabeled per-page spread.

Required reading (bounded):
- `financial_calculation_audit_plan.md:592-611` (symptom #5 wording).
- `00_priors.md:184-213` (E-18, E-19).
- `03_consistency.md:109-213` (F-001), `:580-648` (F-008), `:6049-6060` (C2
  row #5).
- `04_source_of_truth.md:35-295` (Family A), `:296-743` (Family B principal),
  `:2129-2146` (drift row #5).
- The P5-a and P5-b subsections already written to `05_symptoms.md`.
- Live source, Read in full: the five balance producers named in F-001
  (`grid.py`, `accounts.py` checking/loan detail, `savings_dashboard_service.py`,
  `dashboard_service.py`, `year_end_summary_service.py`) at the
  account-balance sites.

Stop condition: symptom #5 subsection written with the single worked
`(user,period,scenario,account)` evaluated at every producer; session ends.

### P5-d -- Verification and consolidation gate (trust-but-verify capstone)

No new symptom analysis. Verify and consolidate.

Tasks:
1. Spot-check: >= 15 cited claims sampled at random across the P5-a/b/c trees,
   each re-resolved to source; show the table and the pass count (threshold:
   100%; any miss reopens that symptom before the gate can pass).
2. Completeness reconciliation: all 5 symptoms have reproduction path +
   hypothesis tree + per-branch linkage + hand-recomputed worked example +
   best-evidence root cause + verification plan; every tree node carries a
   this-session citation; every `NO-FINDING -> RE-INVESTIGATE` branch is
   enumerated.
3. Independent-vs-inherited roll-up: per symptom, confirm / narrow / contradict
   vs the C2 map and drift register; any contradiction is stated as a Phase 5
   finding against the prior phase with both citations.
4. Acceptance gate (section 5 below), each criterion with evidence/verdict.
5. Handoff: what Phase 6 (DRY/SOLID), Phase 7 (test gaps), Phase 8 (findings),
   Phase 9 (open questions) inherit. Record the A-26
   `estimated_retirement_tax_rate` NULL-semantics tail as out-of-symptom-scope
   carried (not dropped).
6. `git status` pasted, showing only `docs/audits/financial_calculations/`.

Stop condition: gate section appended to `05_symptoms.md`; "Phase 5 complete"
recorded with the gate roll-up; session ends.

## 5. Phase 5 acceptance gate (mirrors Phase 3 Gate / Phase 4 Deliverable 6)

Phase 5 is complete only when all hold, each with shown evidence:

- **G1** `05_symptoms.md` exists, non-empty; one subsection per symptom #1-#5,
  each carrying every schema element in section 3.
- **G2** Every hypothesis-tree node cites `file:line` Read during a Phase 5
  session (no node sourced only from Phase 3/4 prose).
- **G3** Every worked example is internally arithmetic-consistent and was
  hand-recomputed this phase (intermediate Decimal steps shown); the
  developer's reported figures ($160 / $114.29; $1911.54 / $1914.34 /
  $1912.94 / $1910.95; the ARM creep) are reproduced or the discrepancy is
  explained.
- **G4** Every tree branch maps to a Phase-3 F-ID or is listed under
  re-investigation with a reason.
- **G5** Spot-check >= 15 claims, 100% resolve; table and count shown.
- **G6** Each symptom's best-evidence root cause is stated against its
  governing E-NN with the remediation direction that E-NN already fixes; no
  symptom verdict is left blocked (all Q-08..Q-26 are answered).
- **G7** Independent-vs-inherited note present for all 5 symptoms; any
  contradiction of C2 / drift register surfaced as a finding.
- **G8** No new auditor-invented "obvious" expectation added to
  `09_open_questions.md`; only genuinely new ambiguities, if any.
- **G9** `git status` shows only `docs/audits/financial_calculations/` files
  changed; no source, test, migration, template, or JS file touched.

## 6. Anti-shortcut prompt (paste at the top of every Phase 5 session)

> This session is part of a read-only audit running in Claude Code's `plan`
> permission mode. Document findings in `05_symptoms.md` with file and line
> citations to the actual source, Read this session. Read the relevant function
> fully before drawing conclusions about its behavior. Verify every factual

> go into `05_symptoms.md`; source files, tests, and migrations remain
> untouched. Stay within the assigned session's symptom scope.

## 7. Failure modes and remedies

- Kitchen-sink session -> one symptom-family per session; `/clear` between.
- Infinite exploration -> the bounded reading lists in section 4; do not widen
  without recording why.
- Trust-then-verify gap -> section 2 contract; the P5-d spot-check is mandatory
  and Phase 3/4 are re-opened, not quoted.
- Mis-rooting -> independent re-derivation can overturn the C2 map; that is a
  finding (G7), not an error to conceal.
- Scope drift -> if a session starts rewriting non-financial code or proposing
  fixes, stop; the deliverable is the explanation, not a patch (audit-plan
  10.6/10.7).

## 8. Ready-to-paste session prompts

These prompts are static and do **not** depend on the *content* of any prior
session's output. Each session's recovery state is the accumulated
`05_symptoms.md` file (audit-plan 10.5): later prompts instruct the agent to
*read the file that now exists*, but the prompt text itself never changes based
on what a prior session concluded. Run them strictly in order
(P5-a -> P5-b -> P5-c -> P5-d), each in its own session started with
`claude --permission-mode plan`, with `/clear` between. Do not use `@` on the
large audit docs (`00`/`01`/`03`/`04`/`09`) -- `@` reads the whole file and
blows context, the exact failure mode section 4 bounds against; the prompts
instruct ranged Reads instead.

### Prompt P5-a (symptom #1)

```text
This session is part of a read-only audit running in Claude Code's `plan`
permission mode. Document findings in
docs/audits/financial_calculations/05_symptoms.md with file and line citations

Phase 4 drift register as hypotheses to falsify, not scaffolding: build the
hypothesis tree from source first, then compare. Every worked example is
recomputed by hand with intermediate Decimal steps shown. Every Q-08..Q-26 is
answered (E-18..E-28); root the symptom against its governing E-NN and state

This is Phase 5 session P5-a. Follow phase5_plan.md section 4 (P5-a) and the
trust-but-verify contract in section 2. Scope: developer symptom #1 only --
projected end balance shows ~$160 on the grid for the current pay period but
~$114.29 as the checking balance on /savings; both must be the same number
from the same inputs.

### Prompt P5-d (verification and consolidation gate)

```text
This session is part of a read-only audit running in Claude Code's `plan`
permission mode. Verify every factual claim by re-resolving the cited
file:line to source; do not recall from memory and do not trust a prior
session's citation without re-opening it. No new symptom analysis. Findings
and the gate go into docs/audits/financial_calculations/05_symptoms.md; source
files, tests, and migrations remain untouched.

This is Phase 5 session P5-d, the trust-but-verify capstone. Follow
phase5_plan.md section 4 (P5-d) and the acceptance gate in section 5. Read the
full docs/audits/financial_calculations/05_symptoms.md (all of Symptom
#1..#5), phase5_plan.md sections 2-5, and
docs/audits/financial_calculations/03_consistency.md lines 6049-6060 (C2) and
04_source_of_truth.md lines 2129-2146 (drift register) for the
independent-vs-inherited roll-up.

Do exactly these tasks, appending to 05_symptoms.md:
1. Spot-check: choose >= 15 cited claims at random across the Symptom #1..#5
   trees; re-resolve each to source (grep/Read); show the table and the pass
   count. Threshold is 100%; any miss reopens that symptom before the gate can
   pass -- record that and stop.
2. Completeness reconciliation: confirm all 5 symptoms carry every section-3
   schema element, every tree node has a this-session citation, and every
   NO-FINDING -> RE-INVESTIGATE branch is enumerated.
3. Independent-vs-inherited roll-up: per symptom, confirm/narrow/contradict vs
   the C2 map and drift register; any contradiction is a Phase 5 finding
   against the prior phase, with both citations.
4. Acceptance gate: criteria G1-G9 from phase5_plan.md section 5, each with
   evidence/verdict.
5. Handoff: what Phase 6/7/8/9 inherit; record the A-26
   estimated_retirement_tax_rate NULL-semantics tail as out-of-symptom-scope
   carried (not dropped).
6. Paste `git status`, confirming only docs/audits/financial_calculations/
   changed.

End by recording "Phase 5 complete" with the G1-G9 roll-up, or, if any gate
fails, name the failing criterion and the symptom to reopen and stop without
declaring completion.

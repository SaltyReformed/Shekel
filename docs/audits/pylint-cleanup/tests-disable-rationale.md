# `shekel-disable-rationale` (W9903) in `tests/`

**Status:** OPEN, unscheduled. Needs a developer ruling before any keystroke.
**Measured:** 2026-08-08, against `dev` at `33103305`.
**Reproduce:** `pylint tests/ tools/ | grep W9903`

---

## The short version

I reported this to you as "`tests/_test_helpers.py` carries 48 pre-existing
`shekel-disable-rationale` findings". That number is right, and the framing was
misleading in two ways this document exists to correct.

1. **It is not one file.** There are **858 findings across 109 test files**.
   `_test_helpers.py` is 48 of them -- **5.6%**, ranking 4th.
2. **They are not oversights.** `tests/` is out of pylint scope by
   **ratified decision #1**, locked with you on 2026-06-04
   (`docs/audits/pylint-cleanup/plan.md:685`). The gate was never pointed at
   this tree, so nothing here regressed; the convention simply does not extend
   to it.

So the real question is not "how do I fix 48 findings" but **"do I want the
rationale convention to apply to `tests/` at all, and if so, how do I get there
without a 858-line commit that reviews as noise?"**

---

## 1. What the rule requires

`shekel-disable-rationale` (W9903, `tools/pylint/shekel_checkers/disable_rationale.py`)
requires every `# pylint: disable=` to carry a `Pylint:` why-comment in a fixed
place, naming every rule it disables. The point is a single grep:

```bash
grep -rn "Pylint:" app/     # every suppression, with its justification
```

Two locations, decided by where the directive sits:

| directive is on | rationale goes |
|---|---|
| a `def` / `class` line (the `too-many-*` smells) | a `Pylint:` note in that symbol's **docstring** |
| any other line | a `# Pylint:` comment **immediately above** |

The marker is capitalised deliberately: pylint matches its own `pylint:` pragma
case-sensitively, so `Pylint:` is invisible to pylint's option parser and cannot
collide with it.

**The `(<count>/<limit>)` shape is convention, not machine-checked.** The
checker enforces marker presence, location, and rule-naming only.

## 2. The measurement

### Repo-wide

```text
tree      findings   files    gated?
--------  --------   -----    ------
app/             0       0    YES  (CI + pre-commit + per-edit hook, --fail-on)
scripts/         0       0    YES  (CI step 5a + pre-commit)
tools/pylint/    0       0    YES  (pre-commit, 10.00/10 floor)
tools/plan_gate/ 1       1    no
tests/         858     109    no
```

The three gated trees are at zero. That is the gate working, not luck.

### The ten heaviest files

```text
 94  tests/test_services/test_savings_dashboard_service.py
 60  tests/test_routes/test_loan.py
 55  tests/test_routes/test_grid.py
 48  tests/_test_helpers.py          <-- the file I reported
 43  tests/test_services/test_cash_walk.py
 26  tests/test_schemas/test_validation.py
 24  tests/test_services/test_cash_fold.py
 23  tests/test_routes/test_savings.py
 19  tests/test_services/test_mfa_service.py
 19  tests/test_routes/test_accounts.py
```

Long tail: 99 further files hold the remaining ~447.

### Inside `_test_helpers.py`

71 disable directives; **48 flagged, 23 already compliant**. The file has been
drifting toward the convention rather than away from it.

By rule:

| rule disabled | directives | flagged |
|---|---|---|
| `import-outside-toplevel` | 66 | 44 |
| `too-many-arguments, too-many-positional-arguments` | 3 | 2 |
| `global-statement` | 2 | 2 |

**By how much work each one is** -- this is the number that matters:

| shape | count | what it needs |
|---|---|---|
| already carries an inline `-- explanation` on the same line | **33** | RELOCATE the existing prose into a `# Pylint:` line above |
| has an ordinary explanatory comment above, missing the marker | **2** | prepend `Pylint: ``rule`` --` to a comment that already exists |
| carries no prose at all | **13** | AUTHOR a rationale (judgement) |

**Roughly 73% of the work is mechanical relocation, not writing.** The file uses
an older in-file convention -- `# pylint: disable=X  -- explanation` -- that
predates the `Pylint:` marker. `.pre-commit-config.yaml:87-91` even names that
older shape when it explains why the `tests/` decimals scan disables
`unknown-option-value`.

### The 13 that need actual thought

## 3. Worked examples

### The target, already in the file (line 434)

```python
    # Pylint: ``import-outside-toplevel`` -- this module imports no app or ORM
    # symbols at top level (its collection-time-safety convention).
    # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
```

### Shape A -- relocate (33 of them). Line 714:

```python
# before
    # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel  -- avoid module-load

# after
    # Pylint: ``import-outside-toplevel`` -- avoid module-load ordering
    # problems; this module must import no app symbols at collection time.
    # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
```

### Shape B -- prepend the marker (2 of them). Lines 3849, 3904:

```python
# before
    # by conftest-adjacent code before the app's models are configured in some
    # collection orders, and the ledger models are needed only by this function.
    from app.extensions import db  # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel

# after -- same prose, one added marker line
    # Pylint: ``import-outside-toplevel`` -- deferred: the ORM is imported by
    # conftest-adjacent code before the app's models are configured in some
    # collection orders, and the ledger models are needed only by this function.
    from app.extensions import db  # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
```

### Shape C -- author one (13 of them). Line 398:

```python
# before
    def stamp(self):
        """Return the next instant: the frozen one, plus one microsecond."""
        global _DB_CLOCK_ISSUED  # pylint: disable=global-statement

# after
    def stamp(self):
        """Return the next instant: the frozen one, plus one microsecond."""
        # Pylint: ``global-statement`` -- the issued-instant counter is
        # process-wide by construction: it exists so two calls in one test
        # cannot return the same microsecond, which a per-instance counter
        # could not guarantee across the fixtures that share the clock.
        global _DB_CLOCK_ISSUED  # pylint: disable=global-statement
```

### Definition-scoped -- the rationale goes in the DOCSTRING (lines 2719, 2904)

```python
def add_entry(  # pylint: disable=too-many-arguments,too-many-positional-arguments
    ...
):
    """<existing summary>

    Pylint: ``too-many-arguments`` / ``too-many-positional-arguments`` (N/5) --
    <why these are irreducible: they are the columns of one row this helper
    builds, and a param object here would make every call site construct a
    value it immediately destructures>.
    """
```

Note ratified decision #3: **never raise a `.pylintrc` threshold to win a
smell.** For a helper whose arguments genuinely are one row's columns, the
documented disable is the right answer; for one that is doing two jobs,
decompose instead.

---

## 4. The decision you actually need to make

This is a ruling, not a task, and it is the reason nothing here should start
with a keystroke.

### Option A -- leave `tests/` out of scope (the status quo)

Ratified decision #1 stands. Cost: zero. What you give up: the `grep "Pylint:"`
guarantee stops at the `app/` boundary, so a suppression in a test file is
unauditable by that grep. Given that `tests/` contains no production logic, that
may be exactly the right trade.

### Option B -- extend the convention to `tests/`, ungated

Fix all 858 over time, no gate. **This is the weakest option** and worth naming
so it is rejected deliberately: without a gate the count regrows, and you would
have spent the effort to arrive back here. The `app/` cleanup's own history is
the evidence -- it needed the `ENFORCE_PYLINT_FLOOR` lock-in to hold.

### Option C -- gate `tests/` for W9903 only, then clean to it

Add a pre-commit hook mirroring the existing `pylint-tests-decimals` one, which
already proves the pattern: `tests/` is out of general scope, but ONE rule is
enforced there because it catches a real defect class.

```yaml
      - id: pylint-tests-disable-rationale
        name: shekel-disable-rationale on tests/
        entry: pylint
        language: system
        types: [python]
        files: ^tests/.*\.py$
        pass_filenames: false
        args:
          - tests/
          - --disable=all
          - --enable=shekel-disable-rationale
          - --disable=unknown-option-value,bad-option-value
```

The `--disable=unknown-option-value,bad-option-value` pair is **not optional**,
and the cost of omitting it is measured: on `_test_helpers.py` alone the scan
emits **99** extra `unknown-option-value` / `bad-option-value` messages, because
pylint reads the older `disable=X -- explanation` comments' trailing prose as
further rule names. `pylint-tests-decimals` hit the same thing and documents it.

Verified working as written:

```console
$ pylint tests/_test_helpers.py --disable=all \
      --enable=shekel-disable-rationale \
      --disable=unknown-option-value,bad-option-value
... 48 W9903 findings, no noise
```

The gate cannot go in until the tree is clean, so this is: clean first, gate
last, in that order.

### Option D -- gate only what new code adds

Same hook, but scoped to changed files (drop `pass_filenames: false`). New and
touched test files must comply; the 858 stay until their file is next edited.
**Cheapest path to "it stops getting worse"**, and it composes with C: adopt D
now, finish the backlog, promote to C.

**My recommendation: D now, C when the count reaches zero.** D costs one hook
and buys the ratchet immediately; C is the lock-in and should follow the
cleanup, not precede it.

---

## 5. If you do clean it, the order that keeps it reviewable

A single 858-finding commit is unreviewable and would bury any judgement call in
it. Suggested sequencing:

1. **`_test_helpers.py` first (48).** It is shared by the whole suite, so its
   conventions propagate; it is already 32% compliant; and 35 of its 48 are
   mechanical. Good calibration for what the rest costs.
2. **`tools/plan_gate/test__plan_gate.py` (1).** One line, and it sits beside a
   tree that IS gated -- the odd one out.
3. **The four heavy files (252).** `test_savings_dashboard_service`, `test_loan`,
   `test_grid`, `test_cash_walk`. One commit each.
4. **The long tail (557 across 104 files).** Batch by directory.

Per commit, the check is:

```bash
pylint tests/<path> --disable=all --enable=shekel-disable-rationale \
       --disable=unknown-option-value,bad-option-value
./scripts/test.sh tests/<path> -q      # comments only; must not move
```

**Every one of these commits changes comments only.** If a test's pass/fail
status moves, something other than a comment was edited -- stop and look.

### Two traps

- **Do not batch-rewrite with a regex.** 13 of the 48 in `_test_helpers.py`
  alone need an authored rationale, and a script cannot tell them from the 33
  that only need relocating. A wrong rationale is worse than none: it tells the
  next reader the suppression was considered when it was not.
- **Some disables should be DELETED, not documented.** Check `useless-suppression`
  (enabled in `.pylintrc`) per file first -- a directive that suppresses nothing
  is itself a finding, and writing a rationale for it entrenches dead code. I
  hit exactly this in `app/` on 2026-08-08: two `too-many-arguments` disables on
  5-argument functions, suppressing nothing.

## 6. Provenance

Surfaced 2026-08-08 while hoisting three tax-config seeders out of
`tests/test_routes/test_salary.py` into `tests/_test_helpers.py` for plan step
R4b-1 (`b4538d25`). My edit introduced 3 new W9903 findings, which I fixed in
that commit; the 48 pre-existing ones I left, and reported, under CLAUDE.md rule
6 (report out of scope, do not fix without approval).

This document exists because my report understated the scope by a factor of ~18
and did not name the ratified decision that put `tests/` outside the gate in the
first place.

**Related:** `docs/audits/pylint-cleanup/plan.md` (the `app/` + `scripts/`
cleanup and its ratified decisions), `docs/coding-standards.md` (the rationale
format), `.pre-commit-config.yaml:80-96` (the `pylint-tests-decimals` precedent
for a single-rule `tests/` gate).

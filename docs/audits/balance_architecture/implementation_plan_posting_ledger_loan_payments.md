# Implementation plan: post confirmed loan payments with their REAL principal / interest / escrow split

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (2026-06-30, v2 -- full rewrite after the adversarial review in
`adversarial_review_posting_ledger_loan_payments.md`). **Commits 1-2 of 7 SHIPPED to the feature branch
(as-built; local, not pushed/PR'd):** C1 `4d5d0ff` (ref tables -- Section 4.1), C2 `c26a899` (the
`budget.ledger_accounts` schema -- Section 4.2; migration head is now `efca4315bf81`). **One as-built
deviation from the original spec: the loan shape CHECK shipped columns-only** (developer-ratified --
see D14 and Section 4.2(4); the original `kind_id IN (...)` form was not implementable). Commits 3-7
pending. **Build-Order Step 4** of Option D (`level1_level2_scope_and_fitness.md`, build-order item 4:
"Post confirmed loan payments with their real principal / interest split; retire the read-time replay
of confirmed history").

**This rewrite supersedes the v1 "contractual mirror" plan.** v1 derived each payment's split from the
loan resolver's *scheduled* amortization and proved `ledger == resolver`. The review showed that
(a) shipped a cash-ledger corruption bug, (b) stored the *contractual* split (which ignores the actual
cash), so it could never reflect a real extra/short payment and kept the loan true-up alive, and
(c) contradicted Option D's own goal of storing the *real* split. This plan stores the real split,
computed from the actual cash paid, and fixes every defect the review found.

**Scope decision (developer, 2026-06-30):**

- **WRITE-ONLY, real-split, validate-then-switch.** Build the reality-authoritative confirmed loan
  ledger and prove it with a hand-computed oracle plus a parallel run against the resolver. **Reads do
  NOT change in this step** -- displayed loan balances keep flowing through the resolver / `balance_at`
  seam. Switching confirmed reads onto the ledger (the change that retires the resolver's confirmed
  replay and ends the true-up dependency) is the **immediate next step** (Section 10), kept separate so
  the foundation is proven before the read path moves. On today's data the ledger and the resolver are
  penny-identical (Section 2.4), so this step is observ­ably a no-op while establishing the correct
  foundation.
- **Escrow = Expense** (per-loan Escrow Expense ledger account). Matches today's net-worth behavior
  (escrow already leaves checking and is not tracked as an asset), so nothing regresses. Modeling
  escrow as a tracked impound asset is a deliberate future feature (it needs disbursement modeling) and
  is out of scope; the Expense choice can be upgraded later via append-only corrections without
  rewriting history.

**Branch:** `feat/posting-ledger-loan-payments` off `dev`.
**Migration head at planning time:** `7d63529e4300` (verified on the prod-clone dev DB; prod == dev at
this head as of the 2026-06-30 clone).

## 1. What this delivers (plain language first)

Today a loan payment is a **transfer**: paying the mortgage writes two shadow `Transaction` rows -- an
expense on Checking (money out) and an income on the loan account (money in). Build-Order Step 2 already
posted that movement as one balanced journal entry: `Checking -1,910.95 / Loan +1,910.95` -- the whole
cash dumped onto the loan, because Step 2 did not know the split. The loan's *real* balance is not read
from that entry; it is recomputed on every screen by the loan resolver, which replays the **scheduled**
payment forward from the latest balance anchor and -- crucially -- **ignores the actual cash you paid**
(`rate_period_engine.py:597-599`).

A loan payment is really **one event with four economic parts**. Your June Mortgage payment ($1,910.95
out the door, 6.875%, $616.99 configured escrow):

```
Checking          -1,910.95   (cash out)
Loan (principal)     +275.14   (debt actually paid down)
Interest expense   +1,018.82   (= balance x rate / 12)
Escrow expense       +616.99   (the configured escrow)
                  ----------
                        0.00
```

Step 2 posted the first two as a 2-leg cash entry. Because a posted entry is **append-only**, Step 4
posts a second balanced **correction** that moves the non-principal off the loan:

```
Loan              -1,635.81   (back out interest + escrow)
Interest expense  +1,018.82
Escrow expense      +616.99
                 ----------
                       0.00
```

Now the loan nets to `1,910.95 - 1,635.81 = 275.14` (the real principal), and Step 2's locked cash
record is untouched.

**The one formula that drives everything (this is the change from v1).** The split is computed from the
**actual cash paid**, not the scheduled payment:

> For each confirmed post-anchor payment, walked in due-date order from the latest anchor balance:
> - `interest = round_money(balance_before x rate / 12)` -- accrued on the **real running balance**;
> - `escrow   = calculate_monthly_escrow(components, payment_date)` -- the **configured** escrow;
> - `principal = cash - interest - escrow` -- the **actual** principal, so any extra or short payment
>   lands here;
> - `balance_after = balance_before - principal`.

The correction's legs are `{Loan: -(interest + escrow), Interest: +interest, Escrow: +escrow}`; the
loan's net (Step-2 cash + this correction) is `cash - (interest + escrow) = principal`, so **the cash
automatically determines principal**. The correction itself only needs `interest` (computed) and
`escrow` (configured); the actual cash flows through Step 2.

**Why this is the financially-sound design -- worked examples** (real Mortgage: balance 177,829.83,
6.875%/12 -> interest 1,018.82; configured escrow 616.99):

| Scenario | Cash | interest | escrow | principal | balance drop |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **On-schedule** | 1,910.95 | 1,018.82 | 616.99 | **275.14** | 275.14 (== resolver, == today) |
| **+$500 extra principal** | 2,410.95 | 1,018.82 | 616.99 | **775.14** | 775.14 -- the extra pays down the loan; **no true-up** |
| **-$200 short** | 1,710.95 | 1,018.82 | 616.99 | **75.14** | 75.14 -- honest partial paydown |
| **payoff overpay** (Van) | > payoff | computed | 0 | capped at balance | excess -> **Refund** leg; loan closes at 0 |

On-schedule the split is byte-identical to the resolver and to today's behavior. It diverges only when
the user pays off-schedule -- and there the ledger is correct and self-maintaining, where the resolver is
wrong and needs a true-up.

**This step does NOT:** change how any screen reads a balance (Section 10); touch Step 2's immutable cash
postings; post a loan's opening balance or reconcile pre-anchor history (Section 10); model escrow as an
asset; post anything for an investment or property account.

## 2. Verified facts (every claim cited to live code on `dev`)

### 2.1 A loan payment is a Transfer with two shadows; the cash is P&I + escrow

`transfer_service.create_transfer` builds an expense shadow on the from-account and an income shadow on
the to-account (`transfer_service.py:389-397`; `_build_shadow:217-258`, forcing `transfer_id=xfer.id`,
`actual_amount=None`). A loan payment's income shadow sits on the loan; loan code finds them via
`transfer_id IS NOT NULL` + Income type (`loan_payment_service.query_shadow_income:215-259`). The
recurring loan-payment transfer's default cash is `calculate_total_payment(monthly_pi, components) =
round_money(monthly_pi + monthly_escrow)` (`escrow_calculator.py:180-196`;
`routes/loan/payment_transfer.py:71-73`).

### 2.2 The resolver ignores the actual cash (this is what v1 froze, and what we replace)

`replay_schedule` takes `confirmed_payment_dates: list[date]` (`rate_period_engine.py:581`); the
`PaymentRecord.amount` is discarded at `loan_resolver/_periods.py:346-350`. Each step does
`principal = period_pi - interest` (`rate_period_engine.py:553`), never the cash. The module says so:
"The cash amount and escrow are NOT inputs -- only the COUNT and dates of the confirmed payments matter"
(`:597-599`). Consequence: an extra payment does not pay the loan down faster; a short payment still
subtracts the full scheduled principal; the only real-cash signal in a resolved balance is the **anchor
true-up**. Step 4 takes the cash as the authority for principal instead.

### 2.3 The app already stores the real escrow

`EscrowComponent` (`loan_features.py:116-156`) stores named line items (property tax, insurance, ...)
each with an `annual_amount` and optional `inflation_rate`; the monthly figure is
`calculate_monthly_escrow` (`escrow_calculator.py:137-177`). On the real Mortgage the configured monthly
escrow is **exactly 616.99** -- identical to the v1 residual `1,910.95 - 1,293.96` (DB-verified). So
config-based escrow is equally correct on-schedule and strictly more correct off-schedule (it never
absorbs extra principal, fees, or a short payment the way a residual does).

### 2.4 Real data: window is tiny, no divergent cash (the foundation is a no-op today)

On the prod clone (2026-06-30, dev == prod): the ledger holds 103 journal entries / 206 postings, all
two-leg. Mortgage (acct 3): latest anchor `user_trueup 2026-05-22 = 177,829.83`; **one** post-anchor
confirmed payment (pay-period start 2026-05-21, monthly due date **2026-06-01 > anchor**, so it replays
-- the due-date-vs-period-start subtlety handled by `monthly_due_date`), cash 1,910.95, real split
275.14 / 1,018.82 / 616.99, balance 177,554.69. Van (acct 8): latest anchor `user_trueup 2026-06-23 =
15,663.59`; **zero** post-anchor. **No loan payment has `actual_amount != estimated_amount`** -- every
real payment is exactly on-schedule. So Step 4 posts exactly one correction on real data, identical to
v1 and to the resolver; the off-schedule machinery's teeth are entirely synthetic fixtures (Section 8),
as required by "extensible to any data a user could have."

### 2.5 The anchor is the opening balance; only post-anchor payments replay

`LoanAnchorEvent` is append-only (one `origination` + zero-or-more `user_trueup`; immutability listeners
at `loan_anchor_event.py:162-189`); the latest by `(anchor_date, created_at)` is the opening balance
(`loan_resolver/_periods.py:263-296`). Eligibility: `anchor.as_of_date < monthly_due_date(d) and d <=
as_of`, payoff cutoff `if balance <= 0: break` (`rate_period_engine.py:655-665`). Pre-anchor payments
are subsumed by the anchor; posting the opening balance + pre-anchor cleanup are Section-10 work.

### 2.6 Step 2 cash entries already exist; reads stay on the resolver

Step 2's backfill posted every settled non-deleted transfer, including all 6 confirmed loan payments
(3/loan). Step 4 adds corrections; it never edits the cash entries. Loan reads dispatch to the resolver,
never the ledger (`balance_at.py:491-516` -> `net_worth_kernel.generate_debt_schedules:182` ->
`loan_payment_service.resolve_account_loan:535-547`; no posting/ledger import in that chain). So this is
genuinely write-only.

### 2.7 The chokepoints that change a loan's confirmed payments (verified complete)

An exhaustive enumeration of every transfer mutation path confirms the set is complete: each path either
does not change a *confirmed* payment or routes through one of these (`transfer_service.py` unless noted):

| Trigger | Site | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| settle / revert / amount or actual edit (status_id/amount/actual_amount) | `:641` (`update_transfer` END; `_POSTING_RELEVANT_FIELDS = {status_id, amount, actual_amount}` at `:80`) | adds / removes / re-amounts a confirmed payment |
| delete (soft + hard; ad-hoc / regen / account cascade) | `:690` (reverse-before-remove; hard delete at `:714`) | removes a confirmed payment |
| restore | `:951` | re-adds a confirmed payment |
| balance true-up | `anchor_service.apply_loan_anchor_true_up:309` (`LoanAnchorEvent` add `:386`) | re-bases the replay |
| rate change (ARM + base/origination) | `routes/loan/escrow_rates.py:107`; `routes/loan/params.py:196` (`_upsert_origination_rate`) | changes the interest split |
| **loan params first created** (2.8 N1) | `routes/loan/params.py:97` + origination anchor `:112` | makes a previously-unresolvable loan resolvable |

A settled-period move is blocked by the finalised-edit lock (`transfers/mutations.py:61-98`,
`state_machine.py:236-288`; `pay_period_id` is a locked field). Recategorize, scenario change,
recurrence regenerate, template delete, carry-forward, pay-period truncate/reset, and account delete
either cannot touch a confirmed payment or are projected-only (verified). Escrow-config edits need no
hook: escrow is read from config **at post time** per payment_date, so a future config change does not
retroactively move a posted split (and must not -- posted history is immutable).

### 2.8 Defects from the adversarial review, and how this plan resolves them

- **CRITICAL (cash-ledger corruption).** v1 linked the correction by `transfer_id` and put its loan leg
  on the loan's linked ledger. Step 2's cash path reads that ledger via `_posted_net(transfer_id,
  ledger)` with **no `source_kind`** (`posting_service.py:227-237,630`), so it would read `cash +
  correction` and post wrong cash reversals on revert/edit/delete, corrupting Checking with no
  self-heal. **Resolution:** link the correction to the income shadow's **`transaction_id`**, not
  `transfer_id` (Section 5.3). `_posted_net` filters `transfer_id`; the cash transaction path skips
  shadows (`transfer_id is not None` guard, `:733`); so the correction is **structurally invisible** to
  both existing readers. No retrofit of `_posted_net`, no easy-to-forget filter.
- **CRITICAL (wrong foundation).** v1 stored the contractual split. **Resolution:** the real-split
  formula (Section 1 / 6), principal from actual cash.
- **HIGH (escrow mislabel).** v1's `escrow = cash - scheduled_payment` mislabeled extra principal, fees,
  short payments, and payoff overpayment as "escrow." **Resolution:** escrow from config; genuine excess
  -> a Refund leg; underpayment -> honest negative principal (Section 6).
- **HIGH (completeness).** Replayed-row count != confirmed-shadow count (pre-anchor, payoff-truncated,
  future-dated). **Resolution:** the ledger's intended content is defined over the **full** post-anchor
  settled set <= as_of, including post-payoff payments routed to Refund; the oracle checks the full set,
  not just the replayed subset (Section 8). Future-dated settled payments (none today) are flagged for
  the read-switch step, not silently dropped.
- **MED (transfer_id overloading / smell).** Resolved by the `transaction_id` linkage above.
- **MED (ledger_account NULL-pattern straining).** **Resolution:** an explicit
  `ref.ledger_account_kinds` discriminator replaces inferring the row kind from which FKs are NULL
  (Section 5.2), which also serves Section 10's opening-balance (Equity) rows.
- **MED (engine purity / broken passthrough).** v1 threaded a DB id through the pure no-db engine and
  the chain was broken at `replay_schedule`. **Resolution:** no engine change. The split is computed in
  the posting service from the income shadows it already loads, reusing the engine's pure *primitives*
  (`monthly_due_date`, rate lookup, rate periods, anchor selection) -- not its replay (Section 6).
- **MED (reconcile/reverse asymmetry).** **Resolution:** per-payment reconcile keyed by
  `transaction_id`, so delete = reconcile-to-zero (`reverse-before-delete`), mirroring the cash path
  exactly (Section 7). The whole-loan re-sync handles the running-balance coupling.
- **MED (oracle invariant break).** `account_posting_total(loan) == settled_transfer_effect +
  settled_transaction_effect` breaks for a loan once corrections exist (masked today: the test mortgage
  has no `LoanParams`). **Resolution:** the Step-4 oracle supersedes that per-account assertion for loan
  accounts (Section 8).
- **MED (M4 no optimistic lock).** `LoanAnchorEvent` / `RateHistory` have no `version_id`
  (`loan_anchor_event.py`, `loan_features.py`). **Resolution:** rely on single-transaction
  reconcile-to-target; advisory lock noted if concurrency ever matters (solo-user low-risk).
- **LOW (over-wiring).** v1 wired the loan reverse into the payback-delete paths; a loan payment is
  never a credit payback (`credit_workflow.py:305-306,529-540`). **Resolution:** wire the loan reverse
  at `:690` only.
- **LOW (un-wired create_params -- N1).** Added to the chokepoint set (2.7).
- **LOW (reset re-anchor -- N2).** `reset_pay_periods` re-anchors via `stage_anchor_true_up`
  (`pay_period_admin.py:743`), safe only because reset is zero-settled-gated; documented, no wiring
  needed.
- **LOW (settled-period-move re-stamp -- N3).** If a future UI ever moves a *settled* payment's period,
  it must re-stamp the entry (an append-only `entry_date` cannot be reconciled,
  `transfer_service.py:74-77`); documented as a constraint on that future feature.

## 3. Design decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Split source | **Actual cash**: principal = cash - interest - escrow | The ledger reflects reality (extra/short captured); Option D's "store the real split" goal. |
| D2 | Interest basis | `balance_before x rate / 12` on the **real running balance** (seeded from the anchor, walked with real principal) | Interest accrues on the actual balance, so a prior extra payment correctly lowers later interest. |
| D3 | Escrow source | **Configured** `calculate_monthly_escrow(components, payment_date)` | The app stores it; honest labeling; respects inflation config. |
| D4 | Genuine excess (payoff overpayment) | Principal capped at remaining balance; excess -> per-loan **Refund Receivable** (Asset) leg | The lender owes you a refund; never mislabeled escrow. |
| D5 | Underpayment | `principal` allowed negative (balance rises); surfaced, not absorbed | Honest negative amortization. |
| D6 | Write form | Append a **correction** on Step 2's immutable cash entry | Step 2's cash leg is correct and locked; a correction is how double-entry fixes posted history. |
| D7 | Linkage | Income shadow's **`transaction_id`** + new `source_kind = loan_payment` | Structurally invisible to `_posted_net` and the cash path -> dissolves the CRITICAL bug. |
| D8 | Escrow class | **Expense** (developer choice 2026-06-30) | Matches today's net worth; asset model is a separate future feature. |
| D9 | Row-kind discriminator | Explicit `ref.ledger_account_kinds` column | Replaces the straining NULL-pattern; future-proofs Section 10's Equity rows. |
| D10 | Reconcile granularity | Per-payment target (by `transaction_id`) + whole-loan re-sync for the running-balance coupling; reverse-before-delete | Unifies the lifecycle with the cash path; no special-case reverse. |
| D11 | Split computation home | Posting service, reusing the engine's pure **primitives** (not its replay); no engine change | Keeps the pure engine clean; decouples real-split from the contractual replay. |
| D12 | Reads | **Unchanged** (resolver / seam); the read switch is Section 10 | Validate-then-switch; foundation proven before the read path moves. |
| D13 | Statement-split override | Out of scope (future hook: enter the lender's exact split, computed split as default) | No gold-plating; the computed split is correct for the common case. |
| D14 | Loan shape CHECK scope (developer choice 2026-06-30, **as-built C2**) | **Columns-only**: `ck_ledger_accounts_loan_shape` enforces a per-loan row's column shape but does NOT pin `kind_id` to the loan kinds | A CHECK cannot subquery `ref.ledger_account_kinds`, and the project forbids hardcoding ref IDs (literal IDs would also break model/migration parity). "A loan row's kind is a loan kind" is the **sole writer's** guarantee (`get_or_create_loan_ledger_account` + tests) -- the identical un-CHECKed trust contract `class_id` already carries (`ledger_account_service.py`). So **Commit 3's resolver guard is load-bearing, not belt-and-suspenders.** |

---

## 4. The chart of accounts and ref additions (additive; no new ledger table)

### 4.1 `ref` additions

- `ref.posting_kinds` += `principal`, `interest`, `escrow`, `refund`.
- `ref.posting_sources` += `loan_payment`.
- `ref.ledger_account_kinds` (NEW table): seed `linked`, `category`, `fallback`, `orphan` (the existing
  four), `loan_interest`, `loan_escrow`, `loan_refund` (and reserve `equity_opening` for Section 10).
- Enums in `app/enums.py`; extend the `_REF_TABLE_SEEDS` lists in `ref_seeds.py`; migration inline-seeds
  with `ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING`. `ref_cache.init()` raises on a missing row in an existing ref
  table -- the Step-3 deploy fix (`create_app(init_ref_cache=False)` for the migration host) already
  covers this; re-verify on the clone.

### 4.2 `budget.ledger_accounts` changes

1. **Add `kind_id`** (FK `ref.ledger_account_kinds`, RESTRICT, NOT NULL). Three-step migration: add
   nullable; backfill from the current NULL-pattern (`account_id` set -> `linked`; `category_id` set ->
   `category`; `is_fallback` -> `fallback`; both-NULL & not fallback -> `orphan`); `alter_column` NOT
   NULL after verifying zero NULLs (raise with the diagnostic SELECT if any survive). The existing
   CHECKs / partial uniques stay (they remain valid); `kind_id` is now the authoritative discriminator
   and every reader keys on it.
2. **Add `loan_account_id`** (FK `budget.accounts`, **RESTRICT**, NULL). Set only on the per-loan
   interest / escrow / refund rows; RESTRICT (not SET NULL) so a loan with ledger accounts cannot be
   deleted -- consistent with "accounts with history are archived, never deleted" and avoiding the
   v1 SET-NULL-orphans-the-kind defect.
3. **`uq_ledger_accounts_loan`** -- partial unique `(user_id, loan_account_id, kind_id)`
   `WHERE loan_account_id IS NOT NULL`. At most one interest, one escrow, one refund account per loan.
4. **`ck_ledger_accounts_loan_shape`** (as-built C2, columns-only -- see D14) --
   `loan_account_id IS NULL OR (account_id IS NULL AND category_id IS NULL AND NOT is_fallback)`.
   It pins the column *shape* of a per-loan row (no account / category link, not the fallback) but does
   **NOT** also constrain `kind_id` to `(loan_interest, loan_escrow, loan_refund)` as this plan first
   proposed: a CHECK cannot subquery `ref.ledger_account_kinds`, and embedding the IDs as literals is
   forbidden (no hardcoded ref IDs) and would break model/migration parity. "A loan row's `kind_id` is a
   loan kind" is therefore the sole writer's contract (the resolver in Section 4.2 below / Commit 3),
   the same un-CHECKed trust `class_id` already carries -- which makes **Commit 3's class/kind guard
   load-bearing** (a writer bug stamping a non-loan kind on a loan row is not caught by the database).

Classes: `loan_interest` / `loan_escrow` are **Expense**; `loan_refund` is **Asset**. The `name` is a
snapshot (`"Mortgage -- Interest"`, etc.) truncated to the column width. Resolver:
`ledger_account_service.get_or_create_loan_ledger_account(user_id, loan_account_id, kind)` -- lazy,
idempotent (by the partial unique; SELECT-then-INSERT relying on the index, not `ON CONFLICT`, mirroring
`get_or_create_category_ledger_account` -- adequate for the solo user, noted).

### 4.3 No `journal_entries` change

Reuse `transaction_id` (nullable, SET NULL, partial index -- `journal_entry.py:206-214`) for the
correction's linkage to the income shadow, plus `source_kind = loan_payment`. No new column.

---

## 5. Linkage and why it is correct

### 5.1 The correction links to the income shadow's `transaction_id`

Each correction entry: `transaction_id = income_shadow.id`, `source_kind_id = loan_payment`,
`transfer_id = NULL`. The income shadow is the loan-side leg of the payment, so it is the natural anchor
for "this payment's split."

### 5.2 Why this dissolves the CRITICAL bug

- Step 2's cash path reads the loan ledger via `_posted_net(xfer.id, to_ledger.id)`, which filters
  `JournalEntry.transfer_id == xfer.id` (`posting_service.py:227-237`). The correction has
  `transfer_id = NULL`, so **`_posted_net` never sees it** -> cash reversals stay correct.
- The cash transaction path (`sync_transaction_postings`, `reverse_postings_before_delete`) returns
  early for any row with `transfer_id` set (`:733`), so it never posts or reads the income shadow as an
  ordinary transaction -> no double-post, and `_posted_net_by_account(shadow.id)` is never called by the
  cash path.
- Only the new Step-4 reader (`_posted_loan_payment_net(transaction_id)`, filtering `transaction_id ==
  shadow.id AND source_kind = loan_payment`) reads the correction. Disjoint by construction.

A regression test asserts that after a loan correction exists, a revert/delete of the payment posts the
**full** cash reversal (Checking returns to 0), proving `_posted_net` is unaffected.

---

## 6. The real-split computation (`posting_service`, no engine change)

A pure walk over the loan's confirmed post-anchor income shadows, reusing the engine's primitives:

```python
def compute_loan_payment_splits(loan_account_id, scenario_id, as_of):
    """Return the real per-payment split for a loan's confirmed post-anchor payments.

    Reuses the pure primitives (anchor selection, rate periods, monthly_due_date)
    but walks with the ACTUAL cash, not the scheduled payment.  Returns a list of
    LoanPaymentSplit(income_shadow_id, interest, escrow, principal, excess) in
    due-date order.  No DB writes; no resolver replay.
    """
```

Mechanics:

1. `anchor = latest LoanAnchorEvent for the loan` (reuse `_select_latest_anchor`). If the loan is not
   resolvable (no `LoanParams`), return `[]` (N1 guard).
2. `periods = build_rate_periods(...)` (pure; the same period set the resolver builds), for the per-date
   rate.
3. Eligible income shadows: confirmed (settled, non-excluded), `transfer_id IS NOT NULL`, Income type,
   on the loan account, scenario-scoped, with `anchor.as_of_date < monthly_due_date(period_start) and
   period_start <= as_of`, **sorted by due date**. Extract the eligibility predicate into a shared
   helper so it cannot drift from the resolver's (the due-date-vs-period-start subtlety, 2.4).
4. Walk, seeded `balance = anchor.balance`:
   - `rate = period_for_date(periods, period_start).annual_rate`;
   - `interest = round_money(balance * rate / 12)` (zero-rate guarded);
   - `escrow = calculate_monthly_escrow(components, payment_date)`;
   - `cash = shadow.effective_amount` (`COALESCE(actual, estimated)`);
   - `principal = cash - interest - escrow`;
   - **cap / excess:** if `principal > balance`: `excess = principal - balance`, `principal = balance`
     (loan closes); else `excess = 0`. (Underpayment leaves `principal` negative; no clamp.)
   - `balance = balance - principal` (>= 0 after a cap; may rise on underpayment);
   - emit `LoanPaymentSplit(shadow.id, interest, escrow, principal, excess)`.
   - **post-payoff:** once `balance <= 0`, a further confirmed payment has `interest = 0`, `escrow = 0`
     (loan closed), `principal = 0`, `excess = cash` -> routed entirely to Refund (so Step 2's cash leg
     on a closed loan is corrected to a refund, not a phantom paydown). The walk continues to the end of
     the eligible set rather than breaking, so every Step-2 cash entry has a matching correction.

The correction legs for a split, dropping zero legs:
`{loan_linked_ledger: -(interest + escrow + excess) [principal], interest_ledger: +interest [interest],
escrow_ledger: +escrow [escrow], refund_ledger: +excess [refund]}` -- balanced by construction. Worked:
the real Mortgage row -> `{Loan -1635.81, Interest +1018.82, Escrow +616.99}`, loan net 275.14. The
+$500 case -> identical correction legs (interest/escrow unchanged); the loan net is `2410.95 - 1635.81
= 775.14` because the larger Step-2 cash leg flows through to principal.

## 7. The posting lifecycle

### 7.1 The service

```python
def sync_loan_payment_postings(loan_account_id, scenario_id):
    """Reconcile a loan's per-payment corrections to the real-split target, idempotently.

    Computes compute_loan_payment_splits(...); for each split, reconciles the
    correction posted under the income shadow's transaction_id to its target legs
    (reverse stale by transaction_id for shadows no longer in the set).  Whole-loan
    because interest accrues on the running balance, so changing one payment
    re-splits the later ones.  Flushes, no commit.
    """

def reverse_loan_payment_postings_for_shadow(income_shadow):
    """Reconcile one payment's correction to zero, before its shadow is deleted.

    Mirrors the cash path's reverse_postings_before_delete: reads the posted
    loan_payment legs for income_shadow.transaction_id and emits a balanced
    reversal, so a hard delete (transaction_id SET NULL) never strands it.
    """
```

Reconcile-to-target per shadow uses `_posted_loan_payment_net(transaction_id)` (the new
`transaction_id AND source_kind = loan_payment` reader); `delta = target - posted`; drop zero legs; emit
one balanced entry if any non-zero (non-zero deltas always sum to zero -> >= 2 legs). Entry header:
`transaction_id = shadow.id`, `source_kind = loan_payment`, `entry_date = _civil_settle_date(
shadow.paid_at, shadow.pay_period)`, scenario/period/owner from the shadow.

### 7.2 Wiring (the chokepoints, 2.7)

- **Settle / revert / amount-or-actual edit / restore.** At `transfer_service.py:641` (update END) and
  `:951` (restore), when `classify_account(xfer.to_account)` is AMORTIZING, call
  `sync_loan_payment_postings(xfer.to_account_id, xfer.scenario_id)` LAST (after the cash sync).
- **Delete.** At `:690`, before removal, call `reverse_loan_payment_postings_for_shadow(income_shadow)`
  for the deleted payment, then (after the delete) `sync_loan_payment_postings(loan, scenario)` to
  re-split the downstream payments whose running balance changed. (Wired at `:690` only -- NOT the
  payback paths; a loan payment is never a credit payback.)
- **True-up.** In `anchor_service.apply_loan_anchor_true_up:309`, after the anchor add/flush, loop
  `for sid in _scenarios_with_loan_payments(account.id): sync_loan_payment_postings(account.id, sid)`.
- **Rate change.** Same scenario-loop sync in `routes/loan/escrow_rates.py:107` AND
  `routes/loan/params.py:196`, after the row mutation, before commit.
- **Loan params first created (N1).** Same scenario-loop sync at the end of `routes/loan/params.py`
  create, so payments settled before the loan was resolvable get their corrections.

Idempotent (reconcile-to-target) and self-healing; a missed hook repairs at the next sync and the
completeness oracle catches gaps on real data. The loan sync touches only loan / interest / escrow /
refund ledgers (never Checking). Idempotency rests on single-transaction reconcile-to-target; the
global true-up / rate paths have no optimistic lock (M4) -- safe for a solo user; an advisory lock on
the loan is the hardening if concurrency ever matters.

---

## 8. The reconciliation oracle (`tests/test_integration/test_posting_ledger_loan_reconciliation.py`)

Correctness rests on **hand-computed literals on synthetic fixtures with distinct off-schedule amounts**
plus a **parallel run** against the resolver (which must AGREE on on-schedule data and DIVERGE exactly
as predicted off-schedule).

1. **Hand-computed split (the core).** Synthetic loans with distinct per-payment amounts and a known
   rate path: assert each correction's `interest` / `escrow` and the loan net (`principal`) equal
   hand-computed literals. Cases: on-schedule; **+extra principal**; **short payment** (negative
   principal, balances); **payoff overpayment -> Refund leg**; an ARM rate step (interest changes
   mid-history); a no-escrow loan (escrow leg dropped).
2. **Parallel run vs resolver.** On an **on-schedule** fixture and on the **real Mortgage**, assert
   `anchor - sum(real principal postings) == resolve_account_loan(...).current_balance` (they must
   match). On an **off-schedule** fixture, assert they DIVERGE and the ledger equals the hand-computed
   real balance (proving the ledger is the more-correct one).
3. **Completeness over the full set.** Every post-anchor settled loan payment <= as_of (including
   post-payoff, routed to Refund) has a correction; no Step-2 cash entry on a loan ledger is left
   uncorrected. Future-dated settled payments (none today) are asserted absent and flagged (a
   `log`/skip with an explicit message), not silently passed.
4. **Per-entry balance** (`SUM = 0`, `COUNT >= 2`) and **trial balance** (global `SUM = 0`).
5. **The CRITICAL-bug regression.** After a correction exists, revert/delete the payment and assert the
   **full** cash reversal posts (Checking ledger returns to 0; `_posted_net` unaffected by the
   correction).
6. **Lifecycle.** settle -> posts; revert -> reverses; restore -> re-posts; **hard delete -> nothing
   stranded** (reverse-before-delete); **true-up past a posted payment -> reverses it + re-splits
   downstream, Checking untouched**; **base-rate AND escrow-rate change -> re-splits**; **multi-scenario
   true-up syncs every scenario**; **loan-params-created-after-settle -> back-posts** (N1).
7. **Superseding the cash oracle for loans.** Replace the per-account `account_posting_total(loan) ==
   settled_transfer_effect + settled_transaction_effect` assertion (which breaks once corrections exist)
   with the loan-aware invariant: `account_posting_total(loan) == settled_transfer_effect(loan) -
   sum(interest + escrow + excess corrections)` `== anchor - current_balance`.
8. **Scenario + owner isolation; backfill == go-forward.**
9. **Two adversarial non-vacuity proofs:** tamper a payment's `actual_amount` -> a hand-computed split
   check FAILS; inject an unbalanced leg -> the trial balance CATCHES it.

---

## 9. Atomic commits

Each independently green (targeted tests + `pylint app/` 10.00 on touched files) with an adversarial
`code-reviewer` pass on the staged diff before committing. Migrations tested up and down. Full suite is
the final gate in the last commit (run alone).

1. **DONE (`4d5d0ff`). Ref:** `principal`/`interest`/`escrow`/`refund` posting kinds, `loan_payment`
   source, and the `ledger_account_kinds` ref table + enums + seeds + inline-seed migration. Tests:
   `ref_cache` resolution; `init()` succeeds; up/down; deploy `init_ref_cache=False` path holds.
   (`equity_opening` deferred to the Section-10 read switch, so every seeded kind has a live consumer.)
2. **DONE (`c26a899`). Schema:** `ledger_accounts.kind_id` (3-step backfill from the NULL-pattern) +
   `loan_account_id` (RESTRICT) + partial unique + the **columns-only** shape CHECK (D14 -- not the
   `kind_id IN (...)` form originally drafted here); rewrote the model docstring taxonomy around the
   explicit kind; the sole writer (`ledger_account_service`) stamps `linked`/`category`/`fallback`.
   Tests: backfill maps every existing row to the right kind (via the shape-CASE evaluated as a SELECT,
   since `kind_id` is NOT NULL at HEAD); partial unique rejects a duplicate (loan, kind); shape CHECK
   rejects a malformed loan row; up/down (pinned constraint names). **As-built gotcha:** making `kind_id`
   NOT NULL broke re-running two *shipped* migrations' backfill SQL in tests (b82538084d24 linked,
   7d63529e4300 category/fallback) -- their frozen INSERTs omit `kind_id`, the migrations are not
   editable, and `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` does not rescue the NOT NULL; fixed by injecting the kind the
   Step-4 backfill would assign into the frozen SQL (shared `inject_cash_backfill_kind_id` helper for
   7d63). Verified up/down/up on the prod-clone dev DB (9 linked + 15 category backfilled correctly,
   `flask db check` no drift, both FKs RESTRICT); full suite 6668; `pylint app/ scripts/` 10.00;
   code-reviewer clean.
3. **Chart resolver:** `get_or_create_loan_ledger_account(user, loan, kind)` (lazy, idempotent,
   class/kind-guarded). **The class/kind guard is LOAD-BEARING, not belt-and-suspenders** (D14): the
   shipped shape CHECK is columns-only, so this resolver is the *only* thing that keeps a loan row's
   `kind_id` to a loan kind (and its class to Expense/Asset). Tests: creates one per (loan, kind);
   idempotent; class is Expense/Asset by kind; **rejects a non-loan kind / wrong class** (the guard that
   substitutes for the absent DB CHECK).
4. **The split + service (pure, no wiring):** `compute_loan_payment_splits`,
   `sync_loan_payment_postings`, `reverse_loan_payment_postings_for_shadow`,
   `_posted_loan_payment_net(transaction_id)`. Tests: all of Section 8.1 (hand-computed splits) +
   idempotent re-sync + reverse + the post-payoff Refund routing + the no-LoanParams guard. Review: the
   `transaction_id` linkage is invisible to `_posted_net`; reuses pure primitives, no engine change;
   touches only loan/interest/escrow/refund; no Flask import.
5. **Lifecycle wiring** (settle/restore at `:641`/`:951`; reverse-before-delete + downstream re-sync at
   `:690`; scenario-looped sync at true-up, both rate paths, and params-create). Tests: Section 8.5
   (CRITICAL regression) + 8.6 (lifecycle) + non-loan transfers ignored; existing transfer/loan/anchor/
   rate suites green. Review: loan sync LAST; reverse before delete; no payback wiring; no Checking
   touch; no double-post.
6. **Historical backfill migration (production-wide):** one correction per confirmed post-anchor settled
   loan payment <= as_of (real-split, per-loan accounts, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`); idempotent via
   `NOT EXISTS` on a prior `loan_payment` entry for that `transaction_id`; down deletes Step-4 entries
   (`source_kind = loan_payment`) + the per-loan ledger accounts. On the prod clone this posts exactly
   the one Mortgage correction (275.14 / 1018.82 / 616.99) and nothing for the Van -- verify. Tests:
   synthetic post-anchor history; exclusions; idempotent; up/down; the exact prod-clone outcome.
7. **The reconciliation oracle** (Section 8) + full suite via `./scripts/test.sh` (run alone) ->
   show `<N> passed` (~6640+ baseline); `pylint app/ scripts/` 10.00; rebuild the test template. Docs:
   note Step 4 done (write-only) in `level1_level2_scope_and_fitness.md`; update the Step-4 memory.
   **Manual (prod-clone dev, 2FA off):** the backfill posted the Mortgage correction + nothing for the
   Van; mark the next Mortgage payment Paid -> new correction + reconcile; mark it with a +$500 actual
   -> the ledger shows principal 775.14 while the resolver still shows the contractual balance (proving
   the ledger is the more-correct record awaiting the read switch); revert -> full cash reversal
   (CRITICAL regression). Leave the dev DB pristine (re-clone if needed).

---

## 10. The next step (read switch -- explicitly out of scope here)

Once this foundation is proven, the immediate follow-up plan switches confirmed loan reads onto the
ledger and ends the true-up dependency:

- **Opening-balance posting** per loan (the latest anchor as an `equity_opening` entry: `Loan +balance /
  Equity -balance`), so `loan balance = sum(postings)` is self-sufficient (uses the reserved
  `equity_opening` kind from Section 4.1).
- **Switch the seam's AMORTIZING confirmed read** to `sum(loan-ledger postings up to T)`, with the
  resolver projecting forward from the ledger's current confirmed balance (projections stay derived,
  Option D). The boundary rule for pre-first-point periods stays in the seam (Level 1).
- **Retire the resolver's confirmed replay** (its job is now the ledger's); pre-anchor cleanup;
  true-ups become rare genuine corrections, not per-off-schedule-payment band-aids.
- Re-evaluate the escrow-as-asset model (D8) and the statement-split override (D13) as their own
  features if wanted.

Gated by the cross-page equality oracle + the loan oracle (Section 8), validate-then-switch.

---

## 11. Out of scope

The opening-balance / Equity posting and the read switch (Section 10); pre-anchor cleanup; escrow as a
tracked impound asset; the statement-split override; investment / property postings; single-entry
consolidation; any change to underlying payment quirks (Rule 6).

---

## 12. Risks and rollback

- **The loan sync must never touch Checking** -- the correction posts only loan/interest/escrow/refund;
  the true-up regression and the CRITICAL regression both assert Checking unchanged.
- **The `transaction_id` linkage is load-bearing** -- the CRITICAL regression (8.5) proves `_posted_net`
  is unaffected; a `code-reviewer` pass confirms no `transfer_id` is set on a correction.
- **Real-split correctness** -- hand-computed oracle fixtures (8.1) + the parallel run (8.2); no engine
  change, so all existing resolver/amortization numeric tests stay byte-for-byte green.
- **Running-balance coupling** -- the whole-loan re-sync on every chokepoint + the downstream re-sync on
  delete; the lifecycle regressions (8.6) cover true-up / rate / delete re-splits.
- **Completeness** -- the full-set oracle (8.3) including post-payoff Refund; future-dated settled is
  flagged, not dropped.
- **Concurrency on global triggers (M4)** -- single-transaction reconcile-to-target; advisory lock if
  ever needed.
- **Rollback.** Each commit independently revertible; reads unaffected throughout (the ledger is
  parallel until Section 10). Reverting the schema commit (2) requires reverting the backfill (6) first.

## 13. Definition of Done

1. All commits landed, each green and each with its `code-reviewer` pass applied.
2. `pylint app/ scripts/` 10.00 with every `--fail-on` checker; zero new messages.
3. Full suite passes (count shown), run alone.
4. All migrations tested upgrade AND downgrade; `build_test_template.py` rebuilt.
5. The loan reconciliation oracle is green, production-wide, and non-tautological (hand-computed +
   parallel-run + off-schedule + the CRITICAL regression).
6. Docs + memory updated; manual prod-clone verification done (including the +$500-actual demonstration
   that the ledger is the more-correct record).
7. Developer asked before commit/push; `dev -> main` PR opened so CI runs.

# X-bi-6-1 and X-bi-6-1b as built: every DISPLAY reader draws a transfer as a LEG (2026-09-20)

Archived under rule 5 at the tick of the two reader leaves (6-1 `45742c05`, 6-1b `6773418b`) that opened the
X-bi-6 family (**R-BAL86**, five leaves; **R-BAL87**, the leg's identity). The commits are the record; the
build logs, the byte-identical harness outputs (`verify_balance_baseline.py`, `verify_render_surfaces.py`,
`verify_grid_cells.py`, the leaf's own `tests/manual/verify_reader_content.py`) and the two adversarial
reviews are `~/projects/shekel-handoffs/HANDOFF-X-bi-6.md` and `balance-2026-09-20/xbi6-1/`, `xbi6-1b/`.
Neither leaf carries a migration or moves money. Below: the X-bi-6 entry as it stood in the README before
the split (verbatim; the `[ ]` is the entry before the tick), then the ledger rows 6-1 closed.

## The X-bi-6 entry as it stood before the split, verbatim

  * [ ] **X-bi-6** delete the transfer shadow `Transaction` ROWS (**R-BAL13**, superseding this
    step's stored-column scope under **R-JA**). Its two columns are two of the **FIVE** clauses
  `restore_transfer` keeps by hand -- `pay_period_id`, `category_id`, `due_date`, `is_override`,
    `status_id` (`_restore.py:144-221`) -- and the fence is wider than the 20 sites first counted: the Python branches are the census markers on its `steps.md` row (re-run at every tick), plus 7 Jinja in 3 templates, 4 inverted guards, 7 query exclusions. **The pair-drift
    repairer is `transfer_service._restore`, NOT `posting_service`**, which only skips and warns --
  deleting the latter removes a skip arm and leaves the repairer standing. The `NO ACTION` restore this entry once carried has no object since the 2026-09-18 re-mint (`credit_card:CC-5` re-cuts that key to a plain FK; its row is **CC-353**, renamed from BAL-506). Closes **BAL-503**. **Still after X-bi-4:
    INVARIANT 5 IS WHY THE MIRROR EXISTS.** Closes **BAL-475**.

## Ledger rows CLOSED at this tick (moved here under the same id)

**N-303** and **N-420** CLOSED at `balance:X-bi-6-1` `45742c05`: the transfers page's cell
(`transfers/_transfer_cell.html`, `render_transfer_cell`) reads the pair's `settled` / `retained` maps through
the leg producers -- one walk with the grid cell -- and prints its figure through the ONE `money()` formatter.
The rows as they stood:

| arc | id | also | finding (one line) | worst measured | status | owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| balance | N-303 (X-au-c3's adversarial review 2026-08-18) | -- | **The transfers PAGE's cell response paints the PLAN over a figure just corrected.** `_render_post_mutation_cell` renders `transfers/_transfer_cell.html` when the request carries no `source_txn_id` -- which is what the popover served by `transfers.get_full_edit` submits -- and that template prints `xfer.amount` unconditionally and is passed neither `settled` nor `retained` | `$0.00` and UNREACHABLE from the UI today: nothing in `app/templates/` emits an `#xfer-cell-<id>` element and nothing calls `transfers.create_ad_hoc`, so the live door is the grid shadow cell, which renders the transaction cell and is correct. The suite drives it as a live door | **OPEN, born with an owner.** It is the "one row, two figures on two surfaces the same click opened" shape `RenderAmounts` exists to prevent, so it is fixed where the transfer render paths are rebuilt rather than by threading two maps into a template with no caller **RE-POINTED 2026-09-11 when `X-au-f` ticked, and half the finding text above is already stale**: the cell prints `budgets[xfer.id]` since `X-au-f-1`, not `xfer.amount`. What SURVIVES is the whole defect -- the template is still passed neither `settled` nor `retained`. `X-bi-6` rebuilds these render paths | X-bi-6 |
| balance | N-420 (`bank_import:X-gj-2b-3`'s reader census 2026-09-01) | -- | **The transfers page's cell prints money through a raw format string, bypassing the ONE template currency formatter.** `transfers/_transfer_cell.html:48` renders `{{ "{:,.0f}".format(xfer.amount) }}` where gate B7 makes `money()` that formatter -- the same bypass `grid/_transaction_cell.html` carried on four figures until `bank_import:X-gj-2b-3` routed them through the macro and the developer ruled the currency mark in (**bank_import:R-IM**) | `$0.00`, and the digits are right: a transfer's amount is a stored magnitude that no entry sum reaches, so ruling **bank_import:R-II** cannot make it signable and the two spellings render identically. What differs is the CURRENCY MARK -- this cell prints `1,234` where every other money surface prints `$1,234` -- and that a second spelling of the formatter exists at all, which is what the gate is about | OPEN, born with an owner. **Outside `bank_import:X-gj-2b-3`'s census (rule 6)**: that step's premise is a negative `transaction_entries.amount`, and no entry reaches this cell. **`balance:N-303` already names this template, this rendering path and this owner** for a different defect, so the two are repaired in one pass rather than twice **RE-POINTED 2026-09-11 when `X-au-f` ticked; the cited line has moved** to `_transfer_cell.html:61` and now reads `budgets[xfer.id]`. The `money()` bypass itself survives. Follows `N-303` to `X-bi-6`, in one pass, as this row already said | X-bi-6 |

## The two rulings as picked, verbatim (the balance lane's record of the developer's answers, 2026-09-20)

The `rulings.md` rows R-BAL86 and R-BAL87 carry every clause under the 2,000-character row cap; this is the
option text as picked, with the lane's timestamps. The whole-PR waits on the rows (`bank_import:X-f6b-2`,
`credit_card:CC-5`) are the coordinator's gating of the developer's "after bank-import 3c merges" /
"after CC-5-1 merges", stated in the question's preamble.

**R-BAL86 (14:12 EDT) -- label "Five leaves, the grid first (Recommended)":** 6-1 THE GRID READS
LEGS: a TransferLeg view object (a planned leg, or a settled leg = transfer + side + its covering
movement, reached through X-bi-6a's one walk) replaces the shadow row in the grid window, mobile
cards and companion; the cell's doors call the transfer routes; the shadow-mutation module and the
five route guards go; closes N-303 and N-420; no schema; touches no file on either peer branch, so
it is buildable today. 6-1b if needed: the remaining display readers (calendar, spending, year-end,
pulse). 6-2 STATEMENT MATCH + RECONCILE PANEL offer legs, keyed (transfer, account), settling
through settle_transfer; after bank-import 3c merges. 6-3 THE LEDGER TAKES SHAPE C: a
Transfers-in-transit clearing account per owner, one posting per movement on its own day, loan
probes re-keyed onto the loan-side movement, a data migration re-booking the 38 settled transfers
graded by ledger-net per (real account, day) byte-identical; own PR; after CC-5-1 merges. 6-4 THE
RECORD HALF RE-PARENTS + THE WRITERS STOP MIRRORING: movements gain a transfer link (its shape, and
what one status means when two legs clear on different days, are 6-4's own forks with worked
dollars), transaction_id nullable with an exactly-one-parent CHECK, the 38 movements backfilled,
the seam gains a Transfer arm, the transfer service's mirror and the five restore clauses go,
carry-forward and recurrence walk budget.transfers; closes N-304, BAL-503; after CC-5-1. 6-5 THE
ROWS GO: the migration deletes the 354 rows, drops transactions.transfer_id and its three
constraints, the seven exclusions and four guards die with them, CLAUDE.md's Transfer Invariants
are rewritten; graded byte-identical on both baselines. Each leaf its own session and adversarial
review; no leaf moves money. REJECTED: "Schema first" (blocked by both peers' migration chains;
the link's fork before anything is built on it); "Two leaves, X-bi-4's shape" (296 sites in one
session, the size R-BAL80 refused). The coordinator's whole-PR gating (6-2 after X-f6b-2's PR;
6-3 / 6-4 after CC-5's PR) was stated in the question's preamble.

**R-BAL87 (14:2x EDT) -- label "(transfer, account) through the one leg producer (Recommended)":**
A leg's identity is the pair (transfer id, the account the leg is on); its side (income or expense)
is derived from which endpoint that account is, by the existing leg_of, the ONE construction. The
existing PlannedTransferLeg becomes TransferLeg, carrying an optional record (its dated covering
movement, reached through X-bi-6a's one walk in transfer_legs, whose join moves once at 6-4); the
fold's plan loader still emits only legs whose record is None, so no fold reads change. The grid
window loads the account set's own rows plus one leg per transfer the set touches (the far-leg rule
R-CC23 applies by transfer id, as far_legs_of already does), the row keys and cells accept either,
and a leg cell reads figure maps keyed by transfer id (transfer_budgets /
transfer_settlement_amounts, the producers the transfer popover already reads). The cell's doors
are the transfer routes: the grid-origin marker source_txn_id becomes leg_account_id, and those
routes render the leg cell back. The shadow-mutation module, forms.py's shadow branch and the five
transaction-route shadow guards go. A leg's label is derived from the endpoints' names. Closes
N-303 and N-420. 6-1 is the grid (desktop, mobile, companion) and its doors; 6-1b, a separate
session, is the remaining display readers (dashboard bills, calendar, spending analysis, year-end,
pulse). REJECTED: "A separate display-tier leg value" (two spellings of one concept, rule 14's
tell); "Leg routes of their own" (a second set of doors inheriting bodies and none of the refusals
unless copied). As built, the maps are keyed by the leg's `cell_key` `(transfer id, account id)`
rather than "by transfer id" alone, so one page map holds rows (`int`) and legs (tuple) without
collision -- the same producers the text names, one key wider.

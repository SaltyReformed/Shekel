# Runbook: the account-10 repair

**STATUS: REHEARSED, NOT YET PERFORMED.** Rewritten by plan step `balance:X-f3c-2b-2c` (2026-10-09)
for ruling **R-BAL3** as amended that day, and rehearsed on same-day copies of production. Nothing
here has been done to production. The procedure this file used to carry (rehearsed 2026-09-01,
superseded by R-BAL3 on 2026-09-05) is in git history, and so are its measurements; read it there
as evidence, never as instructions.

## What this is

Account 10 (*Fidelity Money Market Savings*) and archived account 2 (*Fidelity Savings*) are the
same real Fidelity account (ruling **R-HK**), and the app's record of it disagrees with Fidelity's
own export: one real ACH is recorded twice (**N-382**), five dividends were never recorded, account
10's books open on the wrong day at the wrong figure (**N-379**), and the archived twin still
carries the whole balance on the balance sheet (**N-384**'s instance). Checking (account 1) is in
it too: its books open on a plug rather than on its bank's close (**N-275**), and one of its bank
lines is recorded nowhere (**BAL-468**).

**An owner performs it by clicking through the app**, never by a migration or a script writing
money rows (ruling **R-HJ**). The acts, their order and their reasons are ruled in
`../../plans/rulings.md` at **R-HJ**, **R-HK**, **R-HL**, **R-HM** and **R-BAL3**, amended
2026-10-09 by **R-BAL249** (this file's split), **R-BAL250** (act 9 renames a category),
**R-BAL255** (act 1 cancels rather than deletes) and **R-BAL256** (every Fidelity side is typed
its own day). Until the step's tick files those four in `rulings.md`, and **BAL-622** in
`../../plans/ledger.md`, their verbatim record is the step's handoff folder. This file is how to
carry them out.

**Where the amounts are (ruling R-BAL249).** This file names every amount by its ROLE ("Fidelity's
close for 2026-03-25"), never by its figure. Every figure to type, and every figure to expect after
each act, is on the PERFORMANCE SHEET the rehearsal writes into the handoff folder, derived at run
time from the production copy and the banks' own records. **Type amounts from the sheet of the
same-day rehearsal and from nowhere else.**

---

## Before you start

**1. Is production running the code that was rehearsed?** A rehearsal is evidence only for the
app code it ran on. From the checkout the rehearsal runs from:

```bash
REV=$(docker inspect shekel-prod-app \
        --format '{{index .Config.Labels "org.opencontainers.image.revision"}}')
git diff --quiet "$REV" -- app migrations && [ -z "$(git status --porcelain -- app migrations)" ] \
  && echo "SAME CODE" || echo "DIFFERENT CODE"
```

It compares the deployed revision with the files on disk, uncommitted and untracked ones
included. `DIFFERENT CODE` means rehearse from a clean checkout of `$REV` instead. Plan step
`balance:X-bi-6-4d` rewrites how a transfer's sides are stored, which acts 1, 5 and 8 edit, and
that is why its release waits for this repair; if it ships first, the whole rehearsal is re-run on
that code.

**2. Take a same-day copy, and rehearse on it.** The rehearsal performs every act below through
the same doors you are about to click, on a copy of production taken the same day, and writes the
performance sheet. **The dump is also the repair's backup**: restoring it is part of the
rehearsal, which proves it restores. **If "Add earlier paychecks" is to be performed at all, do it
before taking the dump**, so the rehearsal measures the repair on top of it. Then make no other
change in the app between taking the dump and finishing act 10.

**Run every block from a checkout OUTSIDE `~/projects/Shekel`** (a sibling worktree, such as
`~/projects/shekel-f3c2b2c`): a checkout inside it loads that folder's `.env`, which configures the
app differently from every rehearsal measured here, all of which ran from outside it. First the SETUP block. It only defines names and runs
nothing, so it can be pasted again at any time; fill in the four values in capitals.

```bash
D=~/projects/shekel-handoffs/FOLDER    # the handoff folder for the day, outside every git checkout
F=FIDELITY_CSV                         # the Fidelity history export; S, the SECU daily balances:
S=SECU_CSV                             # both paths are in the handoff record of the step
RESIDUE=BAL467                         # the figure ledger row BAL-467 states, books less bank
B=shekel_f3c2b2c_before                # a copy no act touches
R=shekel_f3c2b2c_rehearsal             # the copy the rehearsal performs on
P=shekel_f3c2b2c_performed             # the copy of production after the performance
U=$(docker exec shekel-dev-db sh -c 'echo "postgresql://$POSTGRES_USER:$POSTGRES_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432"')
psql_dev() { docker exec shekel-dev-db sh -c "PGPASSWORD=\"\$POSTGRES_PASSWORD\" psql -U \"\$POSTGRES_USER\" -d postgres -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -c '$1'"; }
dump_prod() { docker exec shekel-prod-db sh -c 'PGPASSWORD="$(cat /run/secrets/postgres_password)" pg_dump -Fc -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"' > "$1" &&
  [ -s "$1" ] || { echo "STOPPED: the dump $1 failed or is empty"; return 1; }; }
restore() { { psql_dev "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS $1;" && psql_dev "CREATE DATABASE $1 OWNER shekel_user;" &&
  docker exec -i shekel-dev-db sh -c 'PGPASSWORD="$POSTGRES_PASSWORD" pg_restore --no-owner --no-privileges -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d '"$1" < "$2"; } ||
  { echo "STOPPED: restoring $1 failed"; return 1; }; }
run() { db=$1 out=$2; shift 2    # $out holds only the output of the program; errors go to $out.err
  SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_hex(32))') LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 LOG_LEVEL=ERROR \
    PYTHONPATH=$PWD DATABASE_URL="$U/$db" ~/projects/Shekel/.venv/bin/python "$@" > "$out" 2> "$out.err" && rc=0 || rc=$?
  cat "$out"; [ $rc -eq 0 ] || tail -n 20 "$out.err"
  echo "exit $rc  ($*)"; return $rc; }
```

Then the REHEARSAL block. Its steps run inside `( set -e ... )`, so the FIRST failure stops them,
says why, and nothing after it runs. It drops and rebuilds `$B` and `$R`, and nothing else.

```bash
T=$(date +%F_%H%M%S)                   # names every file this run writes; the sheet carries it
( set -e
  [ -d "$D" ] || { echo "STOPPED: no folder $D"; exit 1; }
  for f in "$F" "$S"; do [ -f "$f" ] || { echo "STOPPED: no file $f"; exit 1; }; done
  dump_prod "$D/prod_$T.dump"
  restore $B "$D/prod_$T.dump"; restore $R "$D/prod_$T.dump"
  run $B "$D/score_before_a10_$T.txt" tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py --account 10 --format fidelity --bank "$F"
  run $B "$D/score_before_a1_$T.txt"  tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py --account 1 --bank "$S"
  run $B "$D/render_before_$T.txt"    tests/manual/verify_render_surfaces.py "$D/render_before_$T.json"
  run $R "$D/rehearsal_$T.txt"        tests/manual/rehearse_account_10_repair.py --clone $R --bank "$F" \
        --residue "$RESIDUE" --sheet "$D/sheet_$T.md"
  run $R "$D/score_after_a10_$T.txt"  tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py --account 10 --format fidelity --bank "$F"
  run $R "$D/score_after_a1_$T.txt"   tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py --account 1 --bank "$S"
  run $R "$D/render_after_$T.txt"     tests/manual/verify_render_surfaces.py "$D/render_after_$T.json"
  run $R "$D/baseline_rehearsed_$T.txt" tests/manual/verify_balance_baseline.py "$D/baseline_rehearsed_$T.json"
  diff "$D/render_before_$T.json" "$D/render_after_$T.json" || true   # pages DO differ: read them
)
```

**The rehearsal must end `rehearsal complete` with exit 0, or the repair does not start.** It
refuses BEFORE any write, naming every reason:

* a target it was not pointed at, or one named `shekel` (the deployed database's name AND the
  shared dev runtime's);
* a copy the repair has already touched (both openings, transfers 1 and 102, category 33);
* a stated map that does not reconcile with BOTH banks in both directions: every Fidelity day
  after the books open answered by exactly one transfer or dividend, every settled movement on
  accounts 2 and 10 answered by an act, Checking's four lines of 2026-03-26 exactly the ones the
  map answers and none matched yet, and Checking's movements before SECU's next posted day exactly
  the mapped rows;
* a payroll residue that is not the figure ledger row **BAL-467** states;
* a sheet path inside any git checkout, or one where a file already exists.

Then it refuses AFTER the acts if any verification fails (the sheet's last section).

**3. Work in ONE browser tab.** Log out everywhere else first. A second tab holds pages rendered
before an act, and a save from one would post what it rendered.

**4. Write down Checking's balance for the next paycheck** as the grid shows it. Act 1 is checked
against it.

---

## Already true on production, so not an act

* **Six transfers' Checking sides already sit on SECU's days.** The superseded procedure re-dated
  transfers 156, 154, 157, 346 and 409 onto the bank's days. Since SECU's statements were imported,
  each of those and transfer 155 records, on its Checking side, the day SECU's import OBSERVED,
  and that is the day Fidelity posted it. The rehearsal MEASURES this on each copy and refuses to
  start if any side is not on its day, so it is never assumed. Only their Fidelity sides are left,
  as act 8.

---

## The stop rules

**Perform acts 1 to 10 in ONE sitting.** The sheet prints the rule on its own STOP RULES line;
these are the windows it closes, each measured act by act on the sheet's AFTER lines:

* **Act 1 to act 2: the twin books interest that never happened.** Dropping transfer 1 takes its
  arrival off the twin while the twin's 2026-04-06 assertion still stands, so the gap books a
  correction, and ruling **R-FO** sends an interest-bearing account's correction to its modelled
  `interest_income` row. Act 2 clears it.
* **Inside act 2: do not stop while account 2 is unarchived**, nor between its restatement and its
  assertion. Zeroing the opening while the old assertion stands books the twin's whole asserted
  balance as the same false interest until the new assertion supersedes it, and unarchived, every
  dashboard shows it.
* **Act 3 to act 9: account 10's corrections are enlarged.** They already stand in, as modelled
  interest, for the dividends the app never recorded; restating the opening (act 3) enlarges them,
  and recording the dividends (act 9) empties them.
* **Act 9 to act 10: the last dividend is counted twice.** Until act 10 the latest assertion on
  account 10 is earlier than Fidelity's last dividend, so that dividend sits inside the open
  accrual window beside the modelled accrual it replaces (ruling **R-HM**). Act 10 moves the
  window past it.
* **Inside every row act 7 and act 9 create: finish all three saves before the next row.** Marking
  a row Paid or Received stamps TODAY, so between that save and the day correction the row counts
  in your balances on today's date for its full figure.

**A refused save wrote nothing, and every save before it stands. It shows one of four ways**, and
each means stop and read it:

* on the Edit, Settings and Categories pages, a RED flash at the top of the page;
* on a grid card, NO flash: the card closes as it does after a good save, and the CELL redraws in
  red with a small octagon icon. Its reason is in the cell's tooltip (hover over it). **After
  every save on a grid card, look at the cell**;
* in a balance editor (act 2 step 3, act 10), the editor stays OPEN with small red text in it;
* in the Add Transaction modal (acts 7 and 9), the modal stays OPEN with no message. A good Add
  closes it and reloads the page.

**If the refused save is a row's day correction** (the third save in act 7 or act 9), that row
stands settled on TODAY: do not go on to another act, because the remedy for it has not been
rehearsed. The order below is what keeps this from happening.

---

## The order, and where it is FORCED

**Both restatements (acts 3 and 4) precede every re-date and every new row (acts 5 to 9).** The
books boundary refuses a movement dated on or before its account's `opened_on` (ruling **R-HG**),
so nothing can be dated 2026-03-26 until the books it belongs to open 2026-03-25. Act 9 is caught
by the same rule: account 10's books open 2026-04-05 until act 3, so the 2026-03-31 dividend is
refused -- **and only at its THIRD save**, after the first two have already left a settled row
dated today. Act 7 has the same shape against act 4.

**Transfer 102's day (act 5) needs BOTH openings already restated**, not only its own side's: one
save writes both sides, and the boundary is asked per side. A per-account "restate, then re-date"
walk is one click from a refusal mid-act.

The rest is ruled rather than forced: the twin is zeroed directly after act 1 because act 1 opens
the window act 2 closes; the dividends come after the restatements anyway (ruling **R-HL**); and
act 10 follows act 9 directly (ruling **R-HM**).

---

## Finding things on screen

* **The grid opens on the account Settings > General > Default Grid Account names**, and no page
  links to it on any other account: its own earlier and later arrows keep that account. The grid
  work of acts 1 to 7 is on Checking's grid; act 8 begins by setting that to *Fidelity Money Market
  Savings* (Save Settings), and act 10 ends by setting it back. Neither moves money.
* **The grid shows a window of paychecks.** The arrow left of the window ("Show earlier periods")
  steps back one paycheck at a time; 2026's March and April columns are some way back.
* **A transfer is drawn on each account's grid under the OTHER account's name**: transfer 1 is in
  Checking's row named *Fidelity Savings*.
* **Every new row is created with the grid's "Add Transaction" button** (top of the grid), never by
  clicking an empty cell: the grid draws a row only for a category that already holds something,
  so an empty category has no cell to click. The modal asks Name, Amount, Type, Category and Pay
  Period, and books the row on the account the grid is on. The Pay Period list labels each
  paycheck by its dates, "03/26 - 04/08". After **Add** the page reloads on the same window; the
  new row shows once its column is in view.
* **A restatement is made on the account's Edit page, in the card headed "When the books
  opened"**, below the account's own form: fields **Books opened on** and **Opening equity**, and
  the card's own button **Restate opening**. The page's blue **Update** button belongs to the
  account form and restates NOTHING. **Success is a green flash beginning "Books restated: this
  account now opens on"** with the day and figure you typed; any other message, or none, means the
  opening did not move.

---

## The acts

Each act is headed as the sheet heads it, and each typed value is on the sheet under that act.

### Act 1 -- drop transfer 1: set it back, then cancel it (R-BAL3, R-BAL255)

Transfer 1 is the transfer from Checking to the archived twin, settled 2026-03-27, in the column
of the pay period starting 03/26. Click its cell to open its card, set **Status** to **Projected**
and **Save**. The card closes, and the cell now shows a check-mark button: **do NOT press it**, it
marks the transfer Paid again, dated today. **Click the cell itself to reopen the card, and press
the RED-outlined "Cancel" with the octagon icon, in the bottom row beside the green "Paid"** --
NOT the grey "Cancel" with the x beside Save, which only closes the card (the two buttons share a
word: **BAL-622**).

*Success:* the transfer's cell DISAPPEARS from Checking's grid (a cancelled transfer has no cell),
and Checking's balance for the next paycheck reads what you wrote down before act 1. **If it reads
lower by transfer 1's amount, the transfer was not cancelled**: open its card. If its Status reads
Paid (the check mark was pressed), set Status to Projected and Save first, which closes the card,
and reopen it by clicking the cell (not the check mark). Then press the red Cancel.

*Why:* one real ACH left Checking and reached Fidelity on 2026-03-26, and the app records it
twice. Transfer 102, into account 10, is the record KEPT: SECU's and Fidelity's lines for that day
pair one-for-one (R-BAL3). Cancelled says what is true of transfer 1, that the planned transfer to
the old account did not happen. No page renders a single-transfer delete, and a cancel is not a
soft delete, so the soft delete's restore exposure (**N-386**) is not incurred.

*After:* no displayed balance moves. The twin's corrections rise by transfer 1's amount and its
modelled interest falls by the same: the first window is open.

### Act 2 -- zero the archived twin (account 2) in ONE sitting

1. Accounts, the archived region, account 2: **Unarchive**.
2. Account 2, **Edit**, the "When the books opened" card: keep the day the sheet gives (its
   current one), type **0.00** as the **Opening equity**, press **Restate opening**, and see the
   green "Books restated" flash.
3. Account 2's balance editor (its cell on the Accounts page, or its details page): balance
   **0.00**, as of **2026-04-06**, Save.
4. **Archive** it again.

*Why:* the twin's history is consolidated onto account 10, which opens holding that money (R-HK
as amended by R-BAL3). The 2026-04-06 assertion supersedes the older figure for that day rather
than editing it: assertions are append-only, and the old figure stays in the account's history as
what was believed at the time. The unarchive is forced because an archived account reaches no
balance editor by clicking (**N-453**). The round trip moves no money; the rehearsal grades that
with a fingerprint of the posted ledger either side of each flip.

**Step 2's flash is this act's only visible check of the restatement.** Measured: with step 2
skipped and step 3 done, the twin still reads 0.00, but its whole asserted balance is booked as a
loss of interest. The post-performance comparison catches it, as a balance difference on account
2: such a difference means act 2's restatement did not happen.

*After:* the twin holds **0.00**, and its corrections and modelled interest are **0.00**: the first
window is closed. This is the act whose effect is plainly visible on a balance.

### Act 3 -- restate account 10's books to 2026-03-25 at Fidelity's close for that day

Account 10, **Edit**, "When the books opened": **Books opened on** 2026-03-25, **Opening equity**
Fidelity's close for 2026-03-25 (the sheet's figure; the export carries its 2026-03-12 close
forward, nothing moving until 2026-03-26). **Restate opening**. The green flash goes on to say the
difference shows as a correction against your later balances and that restating those balances
clears it. **Do not restate them**: here the correction stands in for the unrecorded dividends,
and act 9 is what clears it.

*After:* displayed balances unchanged; account 10's corrections grow: the third window is wider.

### Act 4 -- restate Checking's books to 2026-03-25 at SECU's close for that day

Account 1, **Edit**, "When the books opened": **Books opened on** 2026-03-25, **Opening equity**
SECU's close for 2026-03-25 (the sheet's figure, folded from the app's own import of SECU's
statement). **Restate opening**, and see the green flash.

*Why:* Checking's current opening is not a fact but the plug that absorbed 2026-03-26's
movements, the ACH among them (R-BAL3). This is the act that answers **N-275**.

**One governing opening per account** (**BAL-498**). A restatement APPENDS a row, and the newest by
id governs (`app/services/cash_ledger/_events.py`, `governing_account_opening`), so after acts 2
to 4 each of the three accounts is governed by the row its act wrote. The rows they supersede
(each of the three holds two from the migration, all with one shared `created_at`) stay as
history, and no tie-break decides anything.

*After:* nothing on the sheet's lines moves (Checking's own later assertions govern the day the
sheet values at).

### Act 5 -- type transfer 102's day into BOTH sides' boxes, each from its own bank (R-BAL3, R-BAL256)

Open transfer 102 from Checking's grid, in the column of the pay period starting 03/26 (on each
grid a transfer's row is labelled with the OTHER account, so on Checking's it reads *Fidelity
Money Market Savings*; the card's header names the transfer). Its card renders one **Money moved
on** box per side: type
**2026-03-26** into Checking's box AND into account 10's box, then ONE Save.

*Why:* both banks posted it 2026-03-26, the day both books used to open, which is why it was
absorbed on both sides (R-HG) and why acts 3 and 4 had to come first. Each side's day then comes
from its own bank's record (ruling **R-BAL142** gave each side its own day).

*After:* nothing on the sheet's lines moves.

### Act 6 -- re-date Checking's rows onto 2026-03-26, the day SECU posted them

Transactions **781**, **865** and **1069**: each one's card, **Money moved on** **2026-03-26**,
Save. The app dated them 2026-03-27.

781 and 865 together answer ONE payroll line and fall short of it by **BAL-467**'s residue, which
stays open: which row is short is the owner's knowledge, and the bank states one line where the app
states two. 1069 answers its own line exactly.

*After:* nothing on the sheet's lines moves.

### Act 7 -- record bank line 133, which no row answers (BAL-468)

On Checking's grid, **Add Transaction**: the Name the sheet gives, **the bank line's own amount**
(the sheet's figure), Type **Expense**, Category **Family: Birthday** (category 26, ruled by the
developer 2026-09-06), Pay Period the one starting **03/26**; **Add**. Then open the new row's
cell in that column, step back to it if it is out of view, open **More options**, set **Status**
to **Paid** and Save (which stamps today); reopen it, set
**Money moved on** to **2026-03-26** and Save. **Three saves; finish all three before act 8.** The
day box renders only once a row is settled, so the day cannot be typed at creation.

*After:* nothing on the sheet's lines moves; Expense rises by the line's amount (the last section).

### Act 8 -- type Fidelity's day into account 10's box on the 6 other transfers (R-BAL256)

First **Settings > General > Default Grid Account: Fidelity Money Market Savings**, **Save
Settings**; the grid is now account 10's. Then for each transfer, open its card from that grid and
type into **account 10's** box only, then Save:

| transfer | its column (pay period starting) | Fidelity posted it |
|---|---|---|
| 155 | 04/09 | 2026-04-09 |
| 156 | 04/23 | 2026-04-23 |
| 154 | 04/23 | 2026-04-29 |
| 157 | 05/07 | 2026-05-07 |
| 346 | 05/21 | 2026-05-14 |
| 409 | 07/16 | 2026-07-23 |

**Find each one by its column, not by its name**: five of the seven share one name, and the sheet
gives each transfer's amount. Transfer 346 is filed in the 05/21 column although Fidelity posted it
inside 05/07's: the day box moves the day and not the column. On account 10's grid each sits in the
row labelled *Checking*.

Leave every Checking box as rendered: each is SECU's to state, already observed by its import, and
plan step `balance:X-bk-2` grades them. A side that already holds its day as its own (not "a
guess") is skipped, and the sheet then says "nothing to type" for it.

*Why:* each side keeps its own day (R-BAL142). Left alone, a Fidelity side borrows Checking's day
and reads "a guess", and a later correction on the Checking side would move it although Fidelity
says otherwise (R-BAL256).

*After:* nothing on the sheet's lines moves; the money was already on these days.

### Act 9 -- rename the empty category, then record the dividends the app has never held (R-HL, R-BAL250)

**First the category.** Settings, Categories, category **33** (*Financial: Dividend*, created by the
owner and never used): its pencil, Group **Income**, Item Name **Interest & Dividends**, Save. The
rehearsal refuses to start unless category 33 is still the owner's, still named so, and holds
nothing: a rename relabels everything filed under it.

**Then each dividend**, in day order, on account 10's grid: **Add Transaction** with Name
**Dividend** (one name, so all five share one grid row), **the export's dividend that day** (the
sheet's figure), Type **Income**, Category **Income: Interest & Dividends**, and the Pay Period
starting on the date below; **Add**. Then open the new row's cell in that column (step back to
it if it is out of view), open **More options**, set **Status** to **Received** and Save (which
stamps today); reopen it, set **Money moved on** to the dividend's day and Save.
**Three saves per row; finish each row before the next.**

| dividend day | the pay period starting |
|---|---|
| 2026-03-31 | 03/26 |
| 2026-04-30 | 04/23 |
| 2026-05-29 | 05/21 |
| 2026-06-30 | 06/18 |
| 2026-07-31 | 07/30 |

Each is one `DIVIDEND RECEIVED` line in the export; the `REINVESTMENT` line beside it is the same
money buying the core position back and is not a second event. The export's two earlier dividends
fall on or before 2026-03-25 and are inside the opening (R-HG).

*After:* account 10's corrections and modelled interest go to **0.00** (the third window closes),
and account 10 now reads ABOVE Fidelity's last close: the fourth window is open.

### Act 10 -- assert Fidelity's last stated close on 2026-07-31 (R-HM)

Account 10's balance editor: balance **Fidelity's close for 2026-07-31** (the sheet's figure), as of
**2026-07-31**. Save. Then **Settings > General > Default Grid Account** back to the account the
sheet names (the one it was on before act 8), **Save Settings**.

*Why:* the modelled accrual window opens at the latest assertion, so asserting the bank's own close
for the export's last day moves the window past the last dividend (R-HM).

**This is the one act with no undo.** A figure can be corrected by asserting again, but the accrual
window opens at the LATEST assertion, and no door deletes one.

*After:* account 10 reads one day of modelled accrual above Fidelity's close: R-HM names that
property of ruling **R-L**, and it is not this repair's. The fourth window is closed.

## What you will and will not see move

**Most acts move a CORRECTION, not a displayed balance, and an operator who does not know that
will think the repair is doing nothing.** An assertion RESETS the running total on its own day, so
a movement re-dated below an account's latest assertion changes what the records EXPLAIN without
changing what the account SHOWS.

The sheet's BEFORE and AFTER lines value all three accounts at the export's last day, 2026-07-31 (a
fixed point: "today" gives a different figure every day an interest-bearing account is valued),
and print the twin's and account 10's corrections and modelled interest beside them. **Only three
acts move a displayed figure on those lines**: act 2 (the twin to 0.00), act 9 (account 10 rises,
the last dividend counted twice) and act 10 (account 10 falls back to one day of accrual above
Fidelity's close). **Checking's figure never moves at that date**, because its own later assertions
govern it, **nor does any of its figures from today forward** (measured at four forward days).

**On a daily balance screen, measured day by day over 2026-03-20 to 2026-07-31** (the rehearsal of
2026-10-09 14:34, before against after; the figures are in the handoff folder):

* **Checking moves only through 2026-03-26**, its new opening stretch. From 2026-03-27 its own first
  assertion governs, so no later day moves.
* **The twin moves on every day**, to 0.00.
* **Account 10 moves on every day through 2026-04-29, then on 2026-05-29 to 06-22, 06-30 to 07-15,
  and 07-31**: the opening, the dividends and the Fidelity days, each up to the next assertion
  (2026-05-01, 06-23 and 07-16 reset it). **On 2026-07-16 to 07-30 only the SHOWN figure moves**,
  down: act 10 strips modelled accrual the bank's own close replaces (R-HM). Every day Fidelity
  names in those spans now matches its close (the scorer, below).

**Do not use "the trial balance is zero" as a check.** It always is: a deferred database trigger
refuses any journal entry whose legs do not sum to zero, so it measures the trigger. What the acts
move is the balance BETWEEN classes, and the sheet's last section prints every class's move and
asserts the four the repair's own inputs derive: expense rises by act 7's line; the income
statement gains the dividends recorded, less the modelled interest they replace (the sheet prints
it in the ledger's own sign, where income is negative); and the Liability and Unrealized classes do
not move. Asset and Equity move by the restatements, whose figures are the repair's subject.

## After: what to check

### On the rehearsal (before anyone clicks)

* **Account 10:** the opening day, 2026-03-25, prints **0.00** against Fidelity on its own line.
  On the scored days (the bank days above the books plus the days the owner asserted on that the
  bank never names), **the cutover arm is exact on every one**, and it has no reset, so no day is
  exact by construction; **the cash fold is exact on every day carrying no assertion** (its
  assertion days are exact by construction, so its pooled row is the scorer's confounded one); and
  **the RENDERED figure is exact on every day but 2026-07-31**, R-HM's one day of accrual. Before
  the repair, fewer days are scored and fewer are exact. The counts are in the handoff folder.
* **Checking:** the opening day, 2026-03-25, prints **0.00** against SECU on its own line (N-275's
  opening), and the sheet's last section reads Checking's 2026-03-26 off SECU's close by BAL-467's
  residue and nothing else, which is what grades acts 5 to 7. Checking's other scored days are not
  this repair's: what Checking's own assertions disagree with SECU about is plan step
  `balance:X-bk-2`'s reconcile, which waits on this repair (**R-BAL203**).
* **The render check:** zero server errors after, and the pages whose size changed are the three
  accounts' own pages, the grid and the savings page, and no others.

**What the rehearsal also verifies, on the sheet's last section**: every class's move; the twin
holds 0.00; the twin's and account 10's corrections and modelled interest total 0.00; transfer 1
and its rows are Cancelled (the grey-button trap); both books open 2026-03-25 holding their banks'
closes; all seven Fidelity sides record Fidelity's day as their own; account 10 reads Fidelity's
close on 2026-03-26; and Checking reads SECU's close on 2026-03-26 apart by BAL-467's residue and
nothing else, with every Checking movement before SECU's next posted day one the map names.

### On production, after act 10 (the same day as the rehearsal)

**The rehearsal cannot be re-run on production's copy**: it refuses a copy the repair has already
touched. What grades the MONEY the human moved instead is a comparison of that copy with the
rehearsal's own: two copies on which the same acts were performed hold the same balances.
**Measured 2026-10-09: two rehearsals of these acts on one copy, through two different create
paths, gave byte-identical dumps of every figure the balance seam answers, for every account; and
before against after differed only on accounts 1, 2 and 10.** The rehearsal block wrote its dump
of the rehearsed copy beside the sheet, and this block compares against that FILE, so nothing done
to the rehearsal copies since can change the answer. Paste the SETUP block if this terminal does
not still hold it, set `T` to the stamp in the rehearsal's sheet name, then paste:

```bash
T=STAMP                                # from the sheet name of the rehearsal: sheet_STAMP.md
( set -e                               # compares against FILES that rehearsal wrote, never a live copy
  for f in sheet_$T.md score_after_a10_$T.txt score_after_a1_$T.txt baseline_rehearsed_$T.json; do
    [ -f "$D/$f" ] || { echo "STOPPED: no $f in $D"; exit 1; }; done
  dump_prod "$D/prod_after_$T.dump"
  restore $P "$D/prod_after_$T.dump"     # rebuilds $P only
  run $P "$D/score_performed_a10_$T.txt" tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py --account 10 --format fidelity --bank "$F"
  run $P "$D/score_performed_a1_$T.txt"  tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py --account 1 --bank "$S"
  run $P "$D/baseline_performed_$T.txt"  tests/manual/verify_balance_baseline.py "$D/baseline_performed_$T.json"
  for a in a10 a1; do
    if diff "$D/score_after_${a}_$T.txt" "$D/score_performed_${a}_$T.txt"; then echo "SCORE $a AS REHEARSED"
    else echo "SCORE $a DIFFERS (above)"; fi
  done
  if cmp "$D/baseline_rehearsed_$T.json" "$D/baseline_performed_$T.json"; then echo "EVERY BALANCE AS REHEARSED"
  else echo "BALANCES DIFFER: compare the two JSON files"; fi
)
```

**All three "AS REHEARSED" lines should print.** A difference names the account and the figure
where the money departed from the rehearsal (a mistyped amount or day, a skipped act, the grey
Cancel), or a change made in the app after the dump was taken; it is read before anything else is
done. The two balance dumps are compared on the day they are both taken, since a few of their
figures are valued at today.

**What that comparison CANNOT see, because it moves no balance, is checked on screen.** Measured:
a twin left unarchived and dividends filed under another income category both pass all three
lines. So, after them:

* **every Fidelity side carries its own day** (act 5's account-10 box and act 8): from Checking's
  grid, each of transfers 102, 155, 156, 154, 157, 346 and 409 opens (columns in acts 5 and 8)
  with account 10's Money moved on box FILLED with its day. An EMPTY box with the day only in a
  caption under it is still borrowing Checking's day (R-BAL256 not applied): type it and Save;
* **account 2 is archived again** (it is in the Accounts page's archived region);
* **act 7's row sits on Checking's grid under Family: Birthday**, named as the sheet gives;
* **the five dividends sit under Income: Interest & Dividends**, named Dividend, one per column of
  act 9's table: point the grid at account 10 once more to look (Settings > General > Default Grid
  Account), then back;
* **Settings > General > Default Grid Account is back** on the account the sheet names.

The acts assert each of these as they go in the rehearsal, and its verification checks the
Fidelity days; none of them can yet be checked on a performed copy by any instrument. A check mode
of the rehearsal that runs its own verification on the performed copy is owed by this step
(`balance:X-f3c-2b-2c`) and would replace this list.

**Five of Fidelity's days are never compared.** 2026-01-30, 02-24, 02-26, 02-27 and 03-12 fall on
or before the books' opening and are inside the opening equity (R-HG); the scorer prints their
count and endpoints.

**The opening-day lines grade the typing of the openings.** For account 10, the rehearsal types
the export's own close and the scorer compares against the same export, so in a rehearsal that
line cannot fail. For Checking the two come from two of SECU's records, the imported statement and
the daily-balance export, so it can fail only if they disagree. On production's copy they grade
what the human typed.

---

## What this does NOT fix

* **BAL-467's residue stays.** Checking's 2026-03-26 reads SECU's close less that residue; which of
  rows 781 and 865 is short is the owner's knowledge.
* **The class behind the twin survives the instance.** An account archived while its ledger still
  holds a net is a state the app can still reach, and no surface says the balance sheet and the
  dashboards disagree about it (**N-384**), nor does an archived account reach a balance editor by
  clicking (**N-453**). Both are owned by `balance:X-f4`.
* **Checking's 2026-03-26 lines stay unmatched in the statement import.** The repair answers them
  with rows by hand and makes no match.
* **`bank_agreement` still compares from an account's first cash fact rather than from the day
  after its books open (BAL-616).** This step's own code leaf fixes it after the repair is
  performed.
* **The transfer card's two buttons reading "Cancel" (BAL-622).** Act 1 names the right one.

## How this was rehearsed

On copies of production taken the same day and at the current alembic head, driven through the
app's own HTTP doors. Each act fetches the page the owner opens, changes only what the owner types,
and submits the rest as rendered. The exceptions are presses of buttons that carry no form: the
archive flips post nothing, and act 1's cancel posts only the leg's account id its button carries.
Act 9's category group is also supplied, because the page sets that field by script.

* `tests/manual/rehearse_account_10_repair.py`: reconciles the map, performs the acts, verifies
  the post-state and writes the sheet. No production figure or payee is written in it (R-BAL249).
* `tests/manual/measure_cutover_against_bank.py`: scores an account against its bank's export.
* `tests/manual/verify_render_surfaces.py`: renders every authenticated page, before and after.
* `tests/manual/verify_balance_baseline.py`: dumps every balance figure, to compare two copies.

**Seven planted defects were each refused before any write**: a boundary row dropped from the
map, a row borrowed from another day, two transfers exchanged on two different pairings, a
transfer mapped to a day the export does not name, a payroll row moved out of the census window
(refused by the stated residue), and an export carrying an extra movement. The neutral review of
2026-10-09 re-ran them, and its own mutations of each control besides.

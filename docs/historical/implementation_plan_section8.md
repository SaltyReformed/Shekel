## Documentation vs. Code Discrepancies and Open Question Resolution

The following discrepancies and open question resolutions were found by reading the actual
codebase on April 7, 2026. The implementation plan is based on the code, not the documentation.

### D-1: Roadmap prerequisite is overstated -- Section 6 is NOT required

**Roadmap says (line 1467):** "Prerequisite: Sections 5, 5A, and 6 are complete."

**Scope document says:** "Tasks 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7 (computation engines) are pulled into this
section and built alongside their display layers."

**Code says:** Tasks 6.1-6.4 (seasonal forecasting, smart estimates, expense inflation,
deduction inflation) do not exist in the codebase and are not consumed by any Section 8 task.

**Impact:** The scope document is authoritative. Section 6 tasks 6.1-6.4 are NOT prerequisites.
Tasks 6.5, 6.6, and 6.7 are built here. This plan follows the scope document.

### D-2: Roadmap task 8.0b (inaccurate balance values) is not in the scope document

**Roadmap says (line 1485):** Task 8.0b describes inaccurate balance values on the charts page.

**Scope document says:** Task 8.0b is not listed in the task inventory (Section 2) or anywhere
in the scope document.

**Code says:** `chart_data_service.get_balance_over_time()` (line ~260) dispatches correctly
through `_calculate_account_balances()` which handles all account types via the
`has_amortization`/`has_interest` flags on `ref.account_types`. No obvious data pipeline bug
was observed during the code audit.

**Impact:** 8.0b is excluded from this plan per the scope document. If balance value
inaccuracies are observed during implementation, they will be addressed as part of the relevant
commit.

### D-3: Roadmap dashboard description is less detailed than scope document

**Roadmap 8.1 (line 1501):** Lists 7 dashboard items (current balance, days to payday,
upcoming bills, alerts, savings goals, debt summary, quick actions).

**Scope document 4.1.1:** Specifies 7 sections in priority order with detailed interactive
behaviors (mark-as-paid, inline true-up, cash runway, spending comparison).

**Impact:** The scope document is authoritative and more detailed. This plan follows the scope
document's 7-section specification.

### D-4: Notification system (Section 7) does not exist

**Scope document (4.1.1, Section 2):** "If Section 7 (Notifications) is implemented later,
this section can surface notification system alerts."

**Code says:** There is no `system.notification_settings` table, no `system.notifications`
table, and no notification service. The roadmap (line 1334) describes these as stubs "already
stubbed in the schema" but they do not exist in the current codebase.

**Impact:** Dashboard Section 2 (Alerts / Needs Attention) computes alerts directly from
existing data as the scope document specifies. No dependency on Section 7.

### D-5: `chart_data_service.py` line counts have changed since roadmap was written

**Roadmap says:** "chart_data_service.py (720 lines)."

**Code says:** `chart_data_service.py` is 720 lines. This matches. However, several other
files referenced by the roadmap have different line counts (see Codebase Inventory below).

**Impact:** This plan uses current line counts from April 7, 2026.

---

### Open Question Resolutions

### OQ-1: What is the current default route (`/`)?

**Answer:** The default route `/` is served by `grid_bp.route("/")` in
`app/routes/grid.py:133`. Function `grid.index()` renders the full budget grid
(`grid/grid.html`). When the user visits the app root, they see the budget grid with the
current pay period as the leftmost column.

**Impact on plan:** The dashboard (8.1) will replace this as the default route. The grid route
must be re-routed to a non-root URL (e.g., `/grid`). The grid blueprint's `/` mapping moves,
and the new dashboard blueprint claims `/`. The nav bar "Budget" link updates to point to the
grid's new URL.

### OQ-2: Does a debt summary / DTI service exist from task 5.12?

**Answer:** YES. The debt summary and DTI calculation exist in
`app/services/savings_dashboard_service.py`, function `_compute_debt_summary()` (called from
`compute_dashboard_data()`). It returns a dict with keys: `total_debt`,
`total_monthly_payments`, `weighted_avg_rate`, `projected_debt_free_date`, `dti_ratio`,
`dti_label` ("healthy"/"moderate"/"high"), and `gross_monthly_income`. The DTI thresholds are:
< 36% = healthy, 36-43% = moderate, > 43% = high. Escrow is included in monthly totals for
PITI.

**Impact on plan:** Dashboard Section 6 can use this existing debt summary. The dashboard
service calls `savings_dashboard_service.compute_dashboard_data()` or extracts the
`_compute_debt_summary()` logic into a reusable function.

### OQ-3: What is the existing pattern for the grid's "mark as paid" HTMX interaction?

**Answer:** The mark-as-paid interaction is in `app/routes/transactions.py`:

1. **Endpoint:** `POST /transactions/<txn_id>/mark-done` (line 194).
2. **Parameters:** Optional `actual_amount` from form data.
3. **Behavior:** Sets status to `Done` (expense) or `Received` (income). For shadow
   transactions (transfer_id not null), routes through `transfer_service.update_transfer()` to
   keep both shadows and the parent transfer in sync.
4. **Response:** Returns rendered `grid/_transaction_cell.html` with status 200 and
   `HX-Trigger: gridRefresh` header.
5. **Template pattern:** The cell template (`grid/_transaction_cell.html`) uses
   `hx-get="/transactions/<id>/quick-edit"` on click, which renders an inline edit form
   (`grid/_transaction_quick_edit.html`). The form uses `hx-patch="/transactions/<id>"` for
   amount edits. A separate "mark done" button triggers the `mark-done` endpoint.

**Impact on plan:** The dashboard's mark-as-paid action must follow this same endpoint
(`/transactions/<id>/mark-done`) with optional `actual_amount`. The dashboard response can use
a different partial template (a dashboard bill row rather than a grid cell). The `HX-Trigger:
gridRefresh` header causes other listening elements to refresh.

### OQ-4: What is the existing pattern for the grid's anchor balance / true-up interaction?

**Answer:** The true-up interaction is in `app/routes/accounts.py`:

1. **Display mode:** `GET /accounts/<id>/anchor-display` (line 687) returns
   `grid/_anchor_edit.html` with `editing=False`. The display div has
   `hx-get="/accounts/<id>/anchor-form"` on click.
2. **Edit mode:** `GET /accounts/<id>/anchor-form` (line 672) returns
   `grid/_anchor_edit.html` with `editing=True`. Shows input field with escape key handler.
3. **Save:** `PATCH /accounts/<id>/true-up` (line 615) validates via `_anchor_schema`,
   updates `account.current_anchor_balance`, sets `current_anchor_period_id` to current period,
   records in `AccountAnchorHistory`, returns the display partial with
   `HX-Trigger: balanceChanged`.
4. **Cancel:** `hx-get="/accounts/<id>/anchor-display"` on cancel button.

**Impact on plan:** The dashboard's true-up action reuses the same `PATCH /accounts/<id>/true-up`
endpoint. The dashboard renders its own balance display partial that includes the same HTMX
attributes.

### OQ-5: Where is the large transaction threshold best stored?

**Answer:** The `auth.user_settings` table (model: `UserSettings` in `app/models/user.py`)
already stores user-configurable thresholds. Current columns include:
`low_balance_threshold` (Integer, default=500), `default_inflation_rate`,
`grid_default_periods`, `safe_withdrawal_rate`, etc.

**Recommendation:** Add a new column `large_transaction_threshold` (Integer, default=500,
CHECK >= 0) to `auth.user_settings`. This follows the established pattern -- the settings
model is the canonical location for user-configurable numeric thresholds. The settings page
(`app/routes/settings.py`, template `settings/dashboard.html`) already renders and saves
these fields.

### OQ-6: Where is the spending trend alert threshold per category best stored?

**Answer:** There is no per-category settings structure in the codebase. The `budget.categories`
table has only `group_name`, `item_name`, `sort_order`, `is_active`, and `created_at`.

**Recommendation:** Use a single global default threshold stored in `auth.user_settings` as
`trend_alert_threshold` (Numeric(5,4), default=0.1000, CHECK 0 <= value <= 1). Per-category
overrides add complexity with minimal benefit in v1 -- the scope document says "default: 10%
change" and per-category is a nice-to-have. Store the global default first. If per-category
overrides are needed later, add a `trend_threshold_override` column to `budget.categories`.

**OPTION:** If per-category overrides are desired in v1, add a nullable
`trend_threshold_override` (Numeric(5,4), CHECK NULL or 0 < value <= 1) column to
`budget.categories`. When null, the global default applies. This is a one-column migration
with no downstream impact.

### OQ-7: What Chart.js configurations exist across the app that need the 8.0a x-axis fix?

**Answer:** 11 Chart.js chart files exist across the app. The x-axis label format is determined
by the Python service layer (which formats date strings) and by the JS `x.ticks` configuration.

**Charts on the `/charts` page (being removed, but fix applies before removal):**
1. `chart_balance.js` -- x-axis labels from `_format_period_label()`: `"%b %d"` (e.g.,
   "Jan 02"). **No year.** Affected.
2. `chart_net_worth.js` -- same labels source as balance. **No year.** Affected.
3. `chart_net_pay.js` -- labels from paycheck projection. **No year.** Affected.
4. `chart_amortization.js` -- labels from `row.payment_date.strftime("%b %Y")` (e.g.,
   "Jan 2026"). **Has year.** Not affected.
5. `chart_spending.js` -- x-axis is category names, not dates. Not affected.
6. `chart_budget.js` -- x-axis is category names, not dates. Not affected.

**Charts on other pages (persist after `/charts` removal):**
7. `growth_chart.js` (investment dashboard) -- labels from growth projection periods.
   **Needs audit.**
8. `payoff_chart.js` (loan dashboard) -- labels from amortization dates.
   **Needs audit.**
9. `retirement_gap_chart.js` (retirement dashboard) -- labels are income categories, not
   dates. Not affected.
10. `debt_strategy.js` (debt strategy dashboard) -- labels from payoff timeline months.
    **Needs audit.**
11. `chart_slider.js` -- not a chart itself, a date range slider. Not affected.

**Root cause:** `chart_data_service.py:178` function `_format_period_label()` uses
`period.start_date.strftime("%b %d")` which omits the year. This affects charts 1-3 above.
Charts 7, 8, and 10 need their label generation audited in their respective service/route code.

### OQ-8: What is the structure of generated transactions -- do they have a due_date field separate from pay_period assignment?

**Answer:** NO. The `Transaction` model (`app/models/transaction.py`) has NO `due_date` column.
Transactions are assigned to pay periods via `pay_period_id` (FK to `budget.pay_periods`). The
pay period's `start_date` serves as the effective date for that transaction.

The `RecurrenceRule` model (`app/models/recurrence_rule.py`) has a `day_of_month` column (used
by Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual, and Annual patterns) that indicates the calendar day the
bill is due. However, this date is used only by the recurrence engine to determine *which pay
period* the transaction lands in -- it is not stored on the generated transaction.

**Impact on plan:**

- For the financial calendar (8.2), transactions without a `day_of_month` on their recurrence
  rule appear on their pay period's `start_date` (the paycheck date). Transactions whose
  templates have a `day_of_month` can be placed on that calendar day within the month, but
  this requires joining through `Transaction.template -> TransactionTemplate.recurrence_rule
  -> RecurrenceRule.day_of_month`. This join is feasible but adds complexity.
- For budget variance monthly attribution (6.5), transactions are attributed to the month of
  their pay period's `start_date` since there is no explicit due date.
- The scope document's date assignment rules (4.2.1) describe placing transactions "with an
  explicit due date" on that date. Since no due_date column exists, the implementation must
  derive the display date from the template's recurrence rule `day_of_month` when available,
  falling back to the pay period `start_date`.

### OQ-9: What is the current nav bar structure (template file, menu items)?

**Answer:** The nav bar is defined inline in `app/templates/base.html` (lines 42-135), not in
a separate partial. It contains 9 primary nav links:

1. **Budget** -> `grid.index()` -> `/`
2. **Recurring** -> `templates.list_templates()` -> `/templates`
3. **Accounts** -> `savings.dashboard()` -> `/savings`
4. **Salary** -> `salary.list_profiles()` -> `/salary`
5. **Transfers** -> `transfers.list_transfer_templates()` -> `/transfers`
6. **Obligations** -> `obligations.summary()` -> `/obligations`
7. **Retirement** -> `retirement.dashboard()` -> `/retirement`
8. **Charts** -> `charts.dashboard()` -> `/charts`
9. **Settings** -> `settings.show()` -> `/settings`

Plus theme toggle, user display name, and logout button.

**Impact on plan:**
- "Charts" (item 8) is renamed to "Analytics" and pointed at `/analytics`.
- "Budget" (item 1) is pointed at the grid's new URL (e.g., `/grid`).
- A "Dashboard" link may or may not be needed -- since `/` becomes the dashboard, clicking the
  logo or brand link navigates there. Adding an explicit "Dashboard" nav item provides clarity.
  **OPTION:** Add "Dashboard" as item 1, shift "Budget" to item 2. This adds one nav item
  (10 total) but makes the landing page discoverable. Alternatively, the brand/logo link
  serves as the dashboard link with no new nav item.

### OQ-10: What is the full list of files and templates under the current `/charts` route that will be removed?

**Answer:**

**Route file (modified, not deleted -- endpoints replaced):**
- `app/routes/charts.py` (202 lines) -- 7 endpoints to remove.

**Templates to delete (8 files):**
- `app/templates/charts/dashboard.html` (138 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_balance_over_time.html` (35 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_spending_category.html` (23 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_budget_vs_actuals.html` (24 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_amortization.html` (29 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_net_worth.html` (12 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_net_pay.html` (28 lines)
- `app/templates/charts/_error.html` (13 lines)

**JavaScript files to delete (7 files):**
- `app/static/js/chart_balance.js` (113 lines)
- `app/static/js/chart_spending.js` (74 lines)
- `app/static/js/chart_budget.js` (86 lines)
- `app/static/js/chart_amortization.js` (97 lines)
- `app/static/js/chart_net_worth.js` (82 lines)
- `app/static/js/chart_net_pay.js` (91 lines)
- `app/static/js/chart_slider.js` (95 lines)

**Service file (modified, not deleted -- some functions reused):**
- `app/services/chart_data_service.py` (720 lines) -- Functions
  `get_amortization_breakdown()`, `get_net_worth_over_time()`, and `get_net_pay_trajectory()`
  are called by other pages (loan dashboard, retirement dashboard). These functions must be
  preserved or moved. Functions `get_balance_over_time()`, `get_spending_by_category()`, and
  `get_budget_vs_actuals()` are only called by the charts route and can be removed.

**JavaScript files to KEEP (used by other pages):**
- `app/static/js/chart_theme.js` (228 lines) -- theme system, used by all charts.
- `app/static/js/growth_chart.js` -- investment dashboard.
- `app/static/js/payoff_chart.js` -- loan dashboard.
- `app/static/js/retirement_gap_chart.js` -- retirement dashboard.
- `app/static/js/debt_strategy.js` -- debt strategy dashboard.

**Test files (modified):**
- `tests/test_routes/test_charts.py` -- existing chart route tests to update/replace.
- `tests/test_services/test_chart_data_service.py` -- existing service tests to update.

### Additional Discrepancy: Stale anchor detection mechanism

**Scope document (4.1.1, Section 2):** "Stale anchors: accounts that have not been true-up'd
in N days."

**Code says:** The balance calculator already computes a `stale_anchor_warning` boolean
(`app/services/balance_calculator.py:92-109`). This flag is True when the anchor period
contains done/received transactions that were settled after the anchor was set -- meaning the
anchor balance no longer reflects reality. The grid displays this warning
(`grid/grid.html:64`). However, there is no "N days since last true-up" threshold. The
`AccountAnchorHistory` table records each true-up with a `created_at` timestamp, enabling a
staleness check.

**Impact on plan:** The dashboard alerts section can compute anchor staleness by comparing
`MAX(anchor_history.created_at)` against `NOW() - N days`. The threshold N should be stored in
`auth.user_settings` as `anchor_staleness_days` (Integer, default=14, CHECK > 0). This
provides a configurable staleness window.

### Additional Discrepancy: Cash runway service does not exist

**Scope document (4.1.1, Section 3):** "Cash runway: computed using a 30-day rolling average
of daily spending."

**Code says:** No cash runway or daily spending rate service exists. The closest is
`savings_dashboard_service._compute_avg_monthly_expenses()` which computes average monthly
spending from the last 6 periods or template baseline. The savings goal service
(`calculate_savings_metrics()`) computes `months_covered = savings / avg_monthly_expenses`.

**Impact on plan:** The dashboard service computes cash runway as:
`runway_days = current_balance / (avg_daily_spending)` where
`avg_daily_spending = total_paid_expenses_last_30_days / 30`. This is a new computation in the
dashboard service, not a reuse of existing services. The 30-day window uses paid transactions
with actual amounts from the last ~2 pay periods.

### D-6: Transaction model has `updated_at` but no `paid_at`

**Decision:** Add `paid_at` (DateTime, nullable) to `Transaction`.

**Code says:** `app/models/transaction.py:98-102` defines `updated_at` with
`server_default=db.func.now()` and `onupdate=db.func.now()`. This is an audit column that
changes on ANY update (amount edit, notes edit, status change). It is NOT suitable as a
reliable "when was this paid" timestamp because editing notes on a paid transaction would
overwrite it.

**Impact:** `paid_at` must be a separate column. Backfill for existing Done/Received
transactions uses `updated_at` as a best-effort approximation -- for most historical
transactions, the last update WAS the status change. The prompt's backfill strategy is
confirmed valid.

### D-7: Transaction model has no `due_date` column

**Decision:** Add `due_date` (Date, nullable) to `Transaction`.

**Code says:** Confirmed by reading `app/models/transaction.py`. No date columns exist beyond
`created_at` and `updated_at`. Transactions are organized by `pay_period_id` only.

**Impact:** The `due_date` column is purely for display, calendar placement, and analytics
attribution. It must NOT affect balance calculations, which use `pay_period_id` exclusively
(confirmed: `balance_calculator.py:62-64` groups by `txn.pay_period_id`).

### D-8: RecurrenceRule has no `due_day_of_month` column

**Decision:** Add `due_day_of_month` (Integer, nullable, CHECK 1-31) to `RecurrenceRule`.

**Code says:** `app/models/recurrence_rule.py:35-41` defines `day_of_month` with CHECK
constraint `day_of_month IS NULL OR (day_of_month >= 1 AND day_of_month <= 31)`. This column
controls which pay period a transaction is assigned to. The new `due_day_of_month` column
stores when the bill is actually due (if different from the scheduling day).

**Impact:** When `due_day_of_month` is null, `day_of_month` serves as both the scheduling day
and the due date. When set, `due_day_of_month` provides the actual due date while
`day_of_month` continues to control pay period assignment unchanged.

### D-9: Recurrence engine clamps `day_of_month` to month's last day

**Code says:** `app/services/recurrence_engine.py:366-368` in `_match_monthly()`:
```python
last_day = calendar.monthrange(dt.year, dt.month)[1]
target_day = min(day_of_month, last_day)
target_date = date(dt.year, dt.month, target_day)
```
The same clamping pattern appears in `_match_specific_months()` (line 423-424) and
`_match_annual()` (line 446-447). This handles February, 30-day months, etc.

**Impact:** The `due_date` computation for generated transactions must use the same clamping
logic: `min(due_day_of_month, calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1])`. This is already a proven
pattern in the codebase.

### D-10: Transfer service explicitly lists every shadow column

**Code says:** `app/services/transfer_service.py:367-403` sets every Transaction column
explicitly when creating shadow transactions. There are no `**kwargs` or implicit defaults.

**Impact:** Adding `due_date` to Transaction requires adding an explicit `due_date=` parameter
to both shadow Transaction constructors in `create_transfer()` (lines 367-403) and a new
handler block in `update_transfer()` (lines 453-524). The Transfer model itself does NOT need
a `due_date` column -- shadow transactions carry it.

### D-11: No dedicated status revert endpoint exists

**Code says:** There is no "unmark-done" or "revert-to-projected" endpoint. Status changes are
made via `PATCH /transactions/<id>` (line 118) which accepts `status_id` as a field. For
shadow transactions, this routes through `transfer_service.update_transfer()`.

**Impact:** `paid_at` nulling on status revert must be handled in the generic
`update_transaction` PATCH endpoint. When `status_id` is in the update data and the new status
is not settled (e.g., reverting to Projected), `paid_at` must be set to None. This logic goes
in the route handler, not the model.

### D-12: Only one template uses `nav-tabs` in the entire app

**Code says:** Grep of all templates for `nav-tabs`, `nav-pills`, `data-bs-toggle="tab"`, and
`data-bs-toggle="pill"` found exactly one file:

- `app/templates/loan/dashboard.html` (348 lines):
  - Line 21: Primary nav with class `nav nav-tabs mobile-scroll-tabs` (6 tabs for main
    dashboard sections: Overview, Escrow, Rate History, Amortization Schedule, Payoff
    Calculator, Refinance Calculator).
  - Line 267: Nested nav inside Payoff Calculator with class
    `nav nav-tabs mobile-scroll-tabs` (2 tabs: Extra Payment, Target Date).
  - Both use `data-bs-toggle="tab"`.

No other templates use `nav-tabs` or `nav-pills`. The `mobile-scroll-tabs` class is defined
in `app/static/css/app.css:862-881` as a media query that makes tabs horizontally scrollable
at `<576px`.

**Impact:** The nav-pills standardization commit (Commit 4) modifies one file
(`loan/dashboard.html`) plus removes the conditional CSS. The analytics page (Commit 3)
already uses pills.

### D-13: `_match_monthly` determines month from period overlap, not from a fixed month

**Code says:** `app/services/recurrence_engine.py:359-374` -- the `_match_monthly()` function
iterates over periods and checks whether `target_date` (computed from `day_of_month` clamped
to the month) falls within the period's date range (`start_date <= target_date <= end_date`).
A single period can span two calendar months, so both `start_date.month` and `end_date.month`
are checked.

**Impact:** When computing `due_date` for a generated transaction, the month context comes from
the pay period that was matched -- not from a standalone month. For monthly patterns, the
period that "owns" the transaction is the one containing `day_of_month`. The `due_date` must
be computed in the same month as the matched `day_of_month` target.

For the next-month convention (`due_day_of_month < day_of_month`), the due date falls in the
calendar month after the `day_of_month` target. Example: `day_of_month=22` targets the period
containing the 22nd. `due_day_of_month=1` means the bill is due on the 1st of the next month.

### Commit Order Rationale

The ordering follows six principles:

1. **Infrastructure first:** Commit 1 (migration + bug fix) provides the settings columns and
   x-axis fix that other commits depend on.
2. **Data model before consumers:** Commit 2 adds `due_date`, `paid_at`, and
   `due_day_of_month` to the data model. Every downstream commit that reads or displays
   transaction dates depends on these columns existing.
3. **Shell before content:** Commit 3 creates the analytics route shell with nav-pills,
   establishing the URL structure and nav changes before any tab content is built.
4. **Consistency sweep early:** Commit 4 standardizes nav-pills across the app immediately
   after the analytics shell establishes the pattern. This prevents building more UI on top
   of inconsistent navigation.
5. **Engine before display:** Commits 5-7 build the computation engines (pure functions with
   full test coverage) before any display work. Commits 5 and 6 benefit from `due_date`
   existing on transactions (simplified logic, correct monthly attribution).
6. **UI after backend:** Commit 12 adds the `due_date` UI (template form, transaction
   override) after the calendar display (Commit 11) so users can see the calendar context
   that `due_date` enables before being asked to enter the data.

**Phase 1 -- Infrastructure:** Commits 1-2
**Phase 1A -- UI Consistency:** Commits 3-4
**Phase 2 -- Computation Engines:** Commits 5-7
**Phase 3 -- Dashboard:** Commits 8-10
**Phase 4 -- Analytics Display:** Commits 11-16
**Phase 4A -- Due Date UI:** Commit 12 (after calendar, before year-end)
**Phase 5 -- Export and Cleanup:** Commits 17-18

## Commit 1: Settings Migration and X-Axis Date Format Fix (8.0a)

### A. Commit message

```text
fix(charts): add year to x-axis labels crossing year boundary; add Section 8 settings columns
```

### B. Problem statement

Two issues addressed in one commit because the migration and x-axis fix are both small,
independent infrastructure prerequisites:

1. Charts spanning multiple years show x-axis labels like "Jan 02" with no year context. Users
   cannot determine whether a data point is in 2026 or 2027. The fix must detect cross-year
   data and include the year in labels.
2. Section 8 requires three new user settings columns (`large_transaction_threshold`,
   `trend_alert_threshold`, `anchor_staleness_days`) that must exist before the dashboard and
   analytics services can reference them. Adding them now avoids migration dependencies in later
   commits.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/chart_data_service.py` -- Fix `_format_period_label()` to include year when
  data spans multiple years.
- `app/static/js/chart_theme.js` -- Add a shared x-axis tick callback that detects year
  boundaries and appends the year.
- `app/static/js/growth_chart.js` -- Add year-aware x-axis label callback.
- `app/static/js/payoff_chart.js` -- Add year-aware x-axis label callback.
- `app/static/js/debt_strategy.js` -- Add year-aware x-axis label callback.
- `app/models/user.py` -- Add three new columns to `UserSettings`.
- `app/schemas/validation.py` -- Add validation for new settings fields.
- `app/routes/settings.py` -- Render and save new settings fields.
- `app/templates/settings/dashboard.html` -- Add form fields for new settings.
- `migrations/versions/<auto>.py` -- Alembic migration for new columns.
- `tests/test_services/test_chart_data_service.py` -- Add x-axis label tests.
- `tests/test_routes/test_settings.py` -- Add tests for new settings fields.

### D. Implementation approach

**X-axis fix -- Python side:**

Modify `_format_period_label()` in `chart_data_service.py` (line 170-178) to accept a
`spans_multiple_years` boolean parameter:

```python
def _format_period_label(period: PayPeriod, spans_multiple_years: bool = False) -> str:
    """Format a pay period as a short date label.

    Includes the year when the chart data spans multiple calendar years,
    providing context for cross-year data ranges.
    """
    if spans_multiple_years:
        return period.start_date.strftime("%b %d '%y")  # "Jan 02 '26"
    return period.start_date.strftime("%b %d")  # "Jan 02"
```

In `get_balance_over_time()`, `get_net_worth_over_time()`, and `get_net_pay_trajectory()`,
compute `spans_multiple_years` by comparing the first and last period years:

```python
spans_years = periods[0].start_date.year != periods[-1].start_date.year if periods else False
labels = [_format_period_label(p, spans_years) for p in periods]
```

**X-axis fix -- JavaScript side:**

Add a utility function to `chart_theme.js` that can be used by any chart to append the year
at year boundary ticks:

```javascript
ShekelChart.formatDateLabel = function(labels) {
  // Detect if labels span multiple years by checking for year patterns.
  // Returns a tick callback that appends the year at January labels.
  // Used by charts on non-/charts pages that survive the removal.
};
```

Apply this callback in `growth_chart.js`, `payoff_chart.js`, and `debt_strategy.js` by
adding a `ticks.callback` to the x-axis scale configuration that uses the year-aware
formatter. These charts generate their own labels (not from `_format_period_label`) so the
JS-side fix handles them.

**Settings migration:**

Add three columns to `auth.user_settings`:

```python
large_transaction_threshold = Column(
    Integer, nullable=False, server_default="500",
    info={"check": "ck_user_settings_large_txn_threshold >= 0"},
)
trend_alert_threshold = Column(
    Numeric(5, 4), nullable=False, server_default="0.1000",
    info={"check": "0 <= ck_user_settings_trend_threshold <= 1"},
)
anchor_staleness_days = Column(
    Integer, nullable=False, server_default="14",
    info={"check": "ck_user_settings_staleness_days > 0"},
)
```

Migration includes named CHECK constraints and `server_default` so existing rows get the
defaults without a data migration.

**Settings UI:**

Add three form fields to the settings page in a new "Dashboard & Analytics" section:
- "Large Transaction Threshold ($)" -- integer input, min=0.
- "Spending Trend Alert Threshold (%)" -- integer display (stored as decimal), min=1, max=100.
- "Anchor Staleness Warning (days)" -- integer input, min=1.

### E. Test cases

| ID | Test name | Setup | Action | Expected | New/Mod |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| C1-1 | test_format_label_single_year | Period in 2026 | `_format_period_label(p, False)` | "Jan 02" (no year) | New |
| C1-2 | test_format_label_multi_year | Period in 2026 | `_format_period_label(p, True)` | "Jan 02 '26" | New |
| C1-3 | test_balance_labels_single_year | 10 periods in 2026 | `get_balance_over_time()` | Labels have no year suffix | New |
| C1-4 | test_balance_labels_cross_year | 52 periods (2026-2027) | `get_balance_over_time()` | Labels include year suffix | New |
| C1-5 | test_net_worth_labels_cross_year | Periods spanning 2 years | `get_net_worth_over_time()` | Labels include year suffix | New |
| C1-6 | test_save_large_txn_threshold | auth_client | POST /settings with threshold=1000 | Settings saved, value persists | New |
| C1-7 | test_save_trend_threshold | auth_client | POST /settings with threshold=15 | Stored as Decimal("0.1500") | New |
| C1-8 | test_save_staleness_days | auth_client | POST /settings with days=7 | Settings saved, value persists | New |
| C1-9 | test_settings_validation_rejects_negative_threshold | auth_client | POST with threshold=-1 | 422 validation error | New |
| C1-10 | test_settings_validation_rejects_zero_staleness | auth_client | POST with days=0 | 422 validation error | New |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Navigate to `/charts`. Select an account with 52 periods (2-year view). Verify x-axis
   labels show year (e.g., "Jan 02 '26").
2. Select an account with only current-year periods. Verify labels omit year.
3. Navigate to a loan dashboard with a multi-year amortization chart. Verify x-axis labels
   include years.
4. Navigate to `/settings`. Verify the three new fields appear with defaults (500, 10%, 14).
5. Change values, save, reload. Verify values persist.
6. Verify dark mode renders the new settings fields correctly.

### G. Downstream effects

- The `_format_period_label()` signature change is backward-compatible (default parameter).
- New settings columns have `server_default` so all existing users get defaults automatically.
- No other routes or services are affected.

### H. Rollback notes

Revert the migration with `flask db downgrade`. The three columns are dropped. Revert the
Python and JS changes. No data loss -- the columns use server defaults and contain no
user-entered data yet.

## Commit 2: Add due_date, paid_at, and due_day_of_month -- Migration, Generation, and Mark-Paid

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(transaction): add due_date and paid_at to transactions, due_day_of_month to recurrence rules
```

### B. Problem statement

Transactions have no explicit due date or payment timestamp. The `day_of_month` on
`RecurrenceRule` controls pay-period assignment but is not stored on generated transactions,
forcing downstream consumers (calendar, variance, dashboard) to join through three tables to
derive display dates. Adding `due_date` directly on `Transaction` provides a first-class date
for calendar placement, monthly attribution, and bill sorting. Adding `paid_at` enables
payment timing analysis. Adding `due_day_of_month` on `RecurrenceRule` allows the due date to
differ from the pay-period scheduling date.

### C. Files modified

- `app/models/transaction.py` (158 lines) -- Add `due_date` (Date, nullable) and `paid_at`
  (DateTime(timezone), nullable) columns.
- `app/models/recurrence_rule.py` (66 lines) -- Add `due_day_of_month` (Integer, nullable,
  CHECK 1-31) column.
- `app/services/recurrence_engine.py` (552 lines) -- Populate `due_date` when generating
  transactions.
- `app/services/transfer_service.py` (707 lines) -- Pass `due_date` to shadow transactions

  `create_transfer()`.
- `app/routes/transactions.py` (633 lines) -- Set `paid_at` in `mark_done()` and
  `update_transaction()`.
- `app/schemas/validation.py` (1281 lines) -- Add `due_date`, `paid_at` to transaction
  schemas; add `due_day_of_month` to template schemas.
- `migrations/versions/<auto>.py` -- Alembic migration with backfill.
- `tests/test_services/test_recurrence_engine.py` (1948 lines) -- Add due_date generation
  tests.
- `tests/test_routes/test_transactions.py` -- Add paid_at lifecycle tests.
- `tests/test_services/test_transfer_service.py` -- Add due_date shadow propagation tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Model changes:**

In `app/models/transaction.py`, add after `notes` (line 96):

```python
due_date = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=True)
paid_at = db.Column(db.DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=True)
```

Add an index for due_date queries (calendar, dashboard sorting):

```python
db.Index("idx_transactions_due_date", "due_date",
         postgresql_where=db.text("due_date IS NOT NULL")),
```

In `app/models/recurrence_rule.py`, add after `day_of_month` (line 41):

```python
due_day_of_month = db.Column(
    db.Integer,
    db.CheckConstraint(
        "due_day_of_month IS NULL OR (due_day_of_month >= 1 AND due_day_of_month <= 31)",
        name="ck_recurrence_rules_due_dom",
    ),
)
```

**Alembic migration:**

Upgrade:
1. Add `due_day_of_month` to `budget.recurrence_rules` (nullable, CHECK 1-31).
2. Add `due_date` to `budget.transactions` (nullable Date).
3. Add `paid_at` to `budget.transactions` (nullable DateTime with timezone).
4. Add partial index `idx_transactions_due_date`.
5. Backfill `due_date` (see below).
6. Backfill `paid_at` (see below).

Downgrade:
1. Drop index `idx_transactions_due_date`.
2. Drop `paid_at` from `budget.transactions`.
3. Drop `due_date` from `budget.transactions`.
4. Drop `due_day_of_month` from `budget.recurrence_rules`.

**Backfill `due_date`:**

Run as raw SQL within the migration for performance (single UPDATE, no ORM overhead):

```sql
-- Transactions linked to templates with monthly/quarterly/semi-annual/annual patterns
-- that have day_of_month set: compute due_date within the transaction's pay period month.
UPDATE budget.transactions t
SET due_date = (
    SELECT MAKE_DATE(
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM pp.start_date)::int,
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM pp.start_date)::int,
        LEAST(
            rr.day_of_month,
            (DATE_TRUNC('month', pp.start_date) + INTERVAL '1 month' - INTERVAL '1 day')::date
                - DATE_TRUNC('month', pp.start_date)::date + 1
        )::int
    )
    FROM budget.transaction_templates tt
    JOIN budget.recurrence_rules rr ON tt.recurrence_rule_id = rr.id
    JOIN budget.pay_periods pp ON t.pay_period_id = pp.id
    WHERE tt.id = t.template_id
      AND rr.day_of_month IS NOT NULL
)
WHERE t.template_id IS NOT NULL
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM budget.transaction_templates tt2
    JOIN budget.recurrence_rules rr2 ON tt2.recurrence_rule_id = rr2.id
    WHERE tt2.id = t.template_id
      AND rr2.day_of_month IS NOT NULL
  );

-- Transactions without day_of_month (every-paycheck patterns, manual, no template):
-- use pay_period start_date.
UPDATE budget.transactions t
SET due_date = (
    SELECT pp.start_date
    FROM budget.pay_periods pp
    WHERE pp.id = t.pay_period_id
)
WHERE t.due_date IS NULL;
```

**Backfill `paid_at`:**

```sql
-- Set paid_at from updated_at for transactions with settled status.
UPDATE budget.transactions t
SET paid_at = t.updated_at
WHERE t.status_id IN (
    SELECT s.id FROM ref.statuses s WHERE s.is_settled = true
);
```

**Recurrence engine changes (`app/services/recurrence_engine.py`):**

Add a `_compute_due_date()` helper function after the existing pattern-matching helpers:

```python
def _compute_due_date(rule, period, pattern_id):
    """Compute the due_date for a generated transaction.

    Source priority:
    1. rule.due_day_of_month (if set and differs from day_of_month)
    2. rule.day_of_month (derived within the period's month context)
    3. period.start_date (for every-paycheck patterns with no day_of_month)

    Next-month convention: If due_day_of_month < day_of_month, the due date
    is in the following calendar month. Example: day_of_month=22,
    due_day_of_month=1 means the bill is due on the 1st of the next month.

    Month-end clamping: day values > last day of month are clamped (e.g.,
    day 31 in February becomes day 28/29).
    """
    import calendar as cal

    dom = rule.day_of_month
    due_dom = rule.due_day_of_month

    # Patterns without day_of_month: use period start_date.
    if dom is None:
        return period.start_date

    # Determine the base month from the period context.
    # For monthly patterns, the period was matched because it contains
    # the day_of_month target. Use the period's start_date month as
    # the base, checking end_date month if the target is in the next month.
    base_year = period.start_date.year
    base_month = period.start_date.month

    # Check if the target day falls in the end_date's month instead.
    for dt in (period.start_date, period.end_date):
        last_day = cal.monthrange(dt.year, dt.month)[1]
        target_day = min(dom, last_day)
        target = date(dt.year, dt.month, target_day)
        if period.start_date <= target <= period.end_date:
            base_year = dt.year
            base_month = dt.month
            break

    if due_dom is None or due_dom == dom:
        # No separate due date -- use day_of_month in the base month.
        last_day = cal.monthrange(base_year, base_month)[1]
        return date(base_year, base_month, min(dom, last_day))

    # Next-month convention: due_day_of_month < day_of_month means next month.
    if due_dom < dom:
        # Advance to next month.
        if base_month == 12:
            due_year = base_year + 1
            due_month = 1
        else:
            due_year = base_year
            due_month = base_month + 1
    else:
        due_year = base_year
        due_month = base_month

    last_day = cal.monthrange(due_year, due_month)[1]
    return date(due_year, due_month, min(due_dom, last_day))
```

In `generate_for_template()`, after computing `amount` (line 132) and before creating the
Transaction (line 135), compute the due_date:

```python
due = _compute_due_date(rule, period, pattern_id)
```

Add `due_date=due` to the Transaction constructor (line 135-147).

**Transfer service changes (`app/services/transfer_service.py`):**

In `create_transfer()` (lines 367-403), add `due_date=None` to both shadow Transaction
constructors. Transfer shadows do not have inherent due dates -- they inherit from the
transfer context. The caller (transfer_recurrence.py or route handler) can pass `due_date`
as a keyword argument if applicable.

Add parameter `due_date=None` to `create_transfer()` signature. Set on both shadows:

```python
expense_shadow = Transaction(
    ...
    due_date=due_date,    # New
    ...
)
income_shadow = Transaction(
    ...
    due_date=due_date,    # New
    ...
)
```

In `update_transfer()` (lines 450-524), add a new handler block:

```python
# -- due_date -------------------------------------------------
if "due_date" in kwargs:
    new_due = kwargs["due_date"]
    expense_shadow.due_date = new_due
    income_shadow.due_date = new_due
```

**Transfer recurrence changes (`app/services/transfer_recurrence.py`):**

The transfer recurrence engine calls `transfer_service.create_transfer()` (line ~98). Transfer
templates have their own `RecurrenceRule` but no `day_of_month` semantic for due dates.
Transfer shadows get `due_date = period.start_date` (the paycheck date) since transfers
typically happen on payday. Pass this as `due_date=period.start_date` to `create_transfer()`.

**Mark-paid endpoint changes (`app/routes/transactions.py`):**

In `mark_done()` (line 194-260):

For regular transactions (non-transfer), after `txn.status_id = status_id` (line 242), add:

```python
txn.paid_at = db.func.now()
```

For transfer shadows (lines 216-239), add `"paid_at": db.func.now()` to `svc_kwargs` before
calling `transfer_service.update_transfer()`. Then add a handler in `update_transfer()`:

```python
# -- paid_at --------------------------------------------------
if "paid_at" in kwargs:
    new_paid_at = kwargs["paid_at"]
    expense_shadow.paid_at = new_paid_at
    income_shadow.paid_at = new_paid_at
```

In `update_transaction()` (PATCH endpoint, line 118-191), add logic to null `paid_at` when
status reverts from settled to non-settled:

```python
if "status_id" in data:
    new_status = db.session.get(Status, data["status_id"])
    if new_status and not new_status.is_settled and txn.paid_at is not None:
        txn.paid_at = None
    # For transfer shadows, route through transfer_service with paid_at=None
```

**Schema changes (`app/schemas/validation.py`):**

In `TransactionUpdateSchema` (lines 20-35):
- Add `due_date = fields.Date(allow_none=True)`.
- Add `paid_at = fields.DateTime(allow_none=True, dump_only=True)` (read-only in responses).

In `TransactionCreateSchema` (lines 37-50):
- Add `due_date = fields.Date(allow_none=True)`.

In `TemplateCreateSchema` (lines 75-105):
- Add `due_day_of_month = fields.Integer(validate=Range(min=1, max=31), allow_none=True)`.

In `TemplateUpdateSchema` (lines 107-124):
- Add `due_day_of_month = fields.Integer(validate=Range(min=1, max=31), allow_none=True)`.

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Run `flask db upgrade`. Verify migration completes without errors.
2. Run `flask db downgrade` then `flask db upgrade` again to verify round-trip.
3. Query existing transactions -- verify `due_date` is populated on all rows.
4. Query transactions with Done status -- verify `paid_at` matches `updated_at`.
5. Open the grid. Click a transaction cell, mark it as paid. Verify the transaction
   now has a `paid_at` timestamp in the database.
6. Open the grid. Edit a paid transaction's status back to Projected. Verify `paid_at`
   is nulled.

### G. Downstream effects

- All existing queries that read transactions will now see the new columns. Since both are
  nullable, no existing query breaks.
- The balance calculator is NOT affected -- it uses `pay_period_id` for grouping, not dates.
  Test C2-23 verifies this invariant.
- Commits 5, 6, 8, 9, 11-17 can now read `txn.due_date` directly instead of joining through
  template -> recurrence_rule -> day_of_month.

### H. Rollback notes

Revert the migration with `flask db downgrade`. The three columns and one index are dropped.
Backfilled data is lost but can be regenerated. Revert Python changes. The recurrence engine
returns to not setting `due_date`, the mark-paid endpoint returns to not setting `paid_at`.

## Commit 3: Analytics Route Shell with Nav-Pills Tab Structure

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(analytics): create /analytics route with nav-pills lazy-loaded tab structure
```

### B. Problem statement

The `/analytics` page needs to exist as a structural container before any tab content is built.
This commit creates the route, registers the blueprint, sets up the four-tab HTMX lazy-loading
pattern, and updates the nav bar. Each tab returns a placeholder until its content commit lands.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/analytics.py` -- New file: analytics blueprint with 5 endpoints (page + 4 tabs).
- `app/templates/analytics/analytics.html` -- New file: tabbed page extending `base.html`.
- `app/__init__.py` -- Register `analytics_bp` blueprint.
- `app/templates/base.html` -- Rename "Charts" nav item to "Analytics", update URL.
- `tests/test_routes/test_analytics.py` -- New file: route and auth tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Blueprint (`app/routes/analytics.py`):**

```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, redirect, request, url_for
from flask_login import login_required

analytics_bp = Blueprint("analytics", __name__)

@analytics_bp.route("/analytics")
@login_required
def page():
    """Main analytics page with four lazy-loaded tabs."""
    return render_template("analytics/analytics.html")

@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/calendar")
@login_required
def calendar_tab():
    """HTMX partial: calendar tab content."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))
    return "<p class='text-muted'>Calendar -- coming soon.</p>"

@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/year-end")
@login_required
def year_end_tab():
    """HTMX partial: year-end summary tab content."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))
    return "<p class='text-muted'>Year-end summary -- coming soon.</p>"

@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/variance")
@login_required
def variance_tab():
    """HTMX partial: budget variance tab content."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))
    return "<p class='text-muted'>Budget variance -- coming soon.</p>"

@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/trends")
@login_required
def trends_tab():
    """HTMX partial: spending trends tab content."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))
    return "<p class='text-muted'>Spending trends -- coming soon.</p>"
```

**Template (`analytics/analytics.html`):**

Extends `base.html`. Uses Bootstrap 5 nav-pills (not tabs -- pills are more touch-friendly
on mobile per the mobile plan). Each pill triggers an HTMX GET to its endpoint:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="container-fluid py-3">
  <h1 class="h3 mb-3">Analytics</h1>
  <ul class="nav nav-pills mb-3" role="tablist">
    <li class="nav-item">
      <button class="nav-link active" data-bs-toggle="pill"
              hx-get="{{ url_for('analytics.calendar_tab') }}"
              hx-target="#tab-content" hx-trigger="click, load"
              hx-swap="innerHTML">Calendar</button>
    </li>
    <!-- ... year-end, variance, trends pills ... -->
  </ul>
  <div id="tab-content">
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center py-5">
      <div class="spinner-border text-secondary" role="status">
        <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

Calendar is the default tab (loaded on page load via `hx-trigger="click, load"`).

**Nav bar update:** In `base.html`, change the "Charts" nav item:
- Link text: "Analytics"
- URL: `url_for('analytics.page')`
- Active detection: `request.path.startswith('/analytics')`

### E. Test cases

| ID | Test name | Setup | Action | Expected | New/Mod |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| C3- | test_analytics_requires_auth | client | GET /analytics | 302 redirect to /login | New |
| C3- | test_analytics_page_renders | auth_client | GET /analytics | 200, contains "Analytics" | New |
| C3- | test_calendar_tab_htmx | auth_client | GET /analytics/calendar (HX-Request) | 200, placeholder content | New |
| C3- | test_calendar_tab_no_htmx | auth_client | GET /analytics/calendar (no HX-Request) | 302 redirect to /analytics | New |

| C3- | test_nav_shows_analytics | auth_client, seed_user | GET / | Nav contains "Analytics" link | New |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Navigate to `/analytics`. Verify the page loads with four tab pills.
2. Click each tab. Verify placeholder text loads via HTMX swap.
3. Verify the nav bar shows "Analytics" instead of "Charts".
4. Verify the "Analytics" nav item is highlighted when on `/analytics`.
5. Test at 375px width -- verify pills are readable and do not overflow.
6. Toggle dark mode. Verify tab pills and page render correctly.

### G. Downstream effects

- The `/charts` route still exists and functions. It is not removed until Commit 15.
- The nav bar no longer links to `/charts`. Users who have bookmarked `/charts` can still
  access it directly.

### H. Rollback notes

Remove `analytics_bp` from `__init__.py`, delete new files, revert nav bar change. No
migration, no data impact.

## Commit 4: Standardize on Nav-Pills Across the App

### A. Commit message

```text
refactor(ui): standardize Bootstrap nav-pills across all tabbed interfaces
```

### B. Problem statement

The app uses `nav-tabs` on the loan dashboard and `nav-pills` on the new analytics page. The
mobile plan already implemented a `mobile-scroll-tabs` CSS class that converts tabs to
horizontally scrollable pills at `<576px`. Standardizing on pills everywhere removes the
inconsistency and simplifies the CSS -- pills work at all breakpoints without conditional
media queries.

### C. Files modified

- `app/templates/loan/dashboard.html` (348 lines) -- Change `nav-tabs` to `nav-pills` and
  `data-bs-toggle="tab"` to `data-bs-toggle="pill"` in both the primary nav (line 21) and
  the nested payoff calculator nav (line 267). Change `tab-content` to `pill-content` and
  `tab-pane` to `pill-pane` throughout.
- `app/static/css/app.css` (975 lines) -- Remove the `mobile-scroll-tabs` media query
  conditional (lines 862-881). Replace with a non-conditional `.shekel-scroll-pills` class
  that applies horizontal scrolling at all widths where overflow occurs. This is simpler --
  pills naturally handle narrow widths better than tabs.
- `tests/test_routes/test_loan.py` -- Add test verifying loan dashboard renders with pills.

### D. Implementation approach

**Loan dashboard template (`loan/dashboard.html`):**

Line 21: Change `nav nav-tabs mobile-scroll-tabs` to `nav nav-pills shekel-scroll-pills`.
Change all `data-bs-toggle="tab"` to `data-bs-toggle="pill"` on the 6 primary tab buttons
(lines 23, 27, 32, 37, 41, 45).

Change all `tab-content` divs to keep their IDs but use Bootstrap's pill-compatible markup.
Note: Bootstrap 5's `tab-content` and `tab-pane` classes work with both tabs and pills -- the
`data-bs-toggle` attribute is what matters. However, for semantic consistency, update the
`data-bs-toggle` attributes.

Line 267: Change nested `nav nav-tabs mobile-scroll-tabs` to `nav nav-pills shekel-scroll-pills`.
Change the 2 nested tab buttons (lines 269, 273) from `data-bs-toggle="tab"` to
`data-bs-toggle="pill"`.

**CSS (`app/static/css/app.css`):**

Replace the `@media (max-width: 575.98px)` block for `.mobile-scroll-tabs` (lines 862-881)
with a non-conditional class:

```css
/* Horizontally scrollable nav-pills for narrow containers. */
.shekel-scroll-pills {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  overflow-x: auto;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
  scrollbar-width: none;
  -ms-overflow-style: none;
}

.shekel-scroll-pills::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;
}

.shekel-scroll-pills .nav-link {
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

This applies the scrollable behavior regardless of viewport width. On wide screens where all
pills fit, no scrolling occurs (overflow-x: auto only scrolls when content overflows). On
narrow screens, pills scroll horizontally. No media query needed.

### E. Test cases

| ID | Test name | Setup | Action | Expected | New/Mod |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| C4-1 | test_loan_dashboard_renders_pills | auth_client, loan account | GET /accounts/<id>/loan | 200, contains `nav-pills` | New |
| C4-2 | test_loan_dashboard_no_nav_tabs | auth_client, loan account | GET /accounts/<id>/loan | Does NOT contain `nav-tabs` | New |
| C4-3 | test_loan_payoff_nested_pills | auth_client, loan account | GET /accounts/<id>/loan | Payoff Calculator section contains `nav-pills` | New |
| C4-4 | test_analytics_still_uses_pills | auth_client | GET /analytics | Contains `nav-pills` | New |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Navigate to a loan dashboard. Verify pills render instead of underlined tabs.
2. Click each pill (Overview, Escrow, Amortization Schedule, Payoff Calculator, Refinance
   Calculator). Verify content switches correctly.
3. Inside Payoff Calculator, verify Extra Payment and Target Date sub-pills work.
4. For ARM loans, verify the Rate History pill appears.
5. Test at 375px width. Verify pills scroll horizontally when they overflow.
6. Navigate to `/analytics`. Verify pills remain unchanged.
7. Toggle dark mode on both pages. Verify pills render correctly.

### G. Downstream effects

- The `mobile-scroll-tabs` CSS class is removed. If any future template used it, it would
  need to use `shekel-scroll-pills` instead. Currently no other template uses it.
- The loan dashboard test suite may have assertions checking for `nav-tabs` class names --
  these need updating (covered by test C4-2).

### H. Rollback notes

Revert template and CSS changes. No migration, no data impact.

## Commit 5: Calendar Service Engine (6.6)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(calendar): add calendar service for month/year expense aggregation and 3rd paycheck detection
```

### B. Problem statement

The financial calendar (8.2) and year overview (6.6) need a service that groups transactions
by calendar month, computes per-month income/expense/net totals, detects 3rd-paycheck months,
identifies large/infrequent transactions, and computes projected month-end balances. Now that
`Transaction.due_date` exists (Commit 2), the service reads it directly instead of joining
through template -> recurrence_rule -> day_of_month.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/calendar_service.py` -- New file: calendar data aggregation engine.
- `tests/test_services/test_calendar_service.py` -- New file: full test coverage.

### D. Implementation approach

**New service: `app/services/calendar_service.py`**

Pure function service -- no Flask imports, no database writes.

**Data structures:**

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DayEntry:
    """A single transaction on a calendar day."""
    transaction_id: int
    name: str
    amount: Decimal  # effective_amount
    is_income: bool
    is_paid: bool  # status is done/received/settled
    is_large: bool  # exceeds threshold
    is_infrequent: bool  # recurrence less frequent than monthly
    category_group: str | None
    category_item: str | None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MonthSummary:
    """Aggregated data for one calendar month."""
    year: int

```

**Transaction date assignment logic (simplified by Commit 2):**

For each transaction in the month's pay periods:
1. Read `txn.due_date` directly. This is always populated (by the recurrence engine for
   template-generated transactions, by the backfill migration for historical transactions).
2. Display the transaction on `txn.due_date.day` within the calendar month.
3. Fallback (defensive): if `txn.due_date` is None, use `txn.pay_period.start_date.day`.

No joins through template -> recurrence_rule are needed. The `due_date` column already
contains the clamped, month-aware display date computed by `_compute_due_date()` in the
recurrence engine.

**Month-end balance:**

Query the balance calculator for the last pay period ending in or after the month. The
projected end balance of that period approximates the month-end balance. For the year
overview, this provides 12 balance data points.

**Large transaction detection:**

A transaction is "large" if `txn.effective_amount >= large_threshold`. The threshold is
passed in as a parameter (loaded from `user_settings.large_transaction_threshold` by the
caller).

**3rd paycheck detection:**

Count how many pay period `start_date` values fall within each month. Standard biweekly pay
produces 2 months per year with 3 paychecks. These months have extra income.

**Database queries:**

The service queries `Transaction` joined with `PayPeriod`, filtered by:
- `Transaction.account_id == account_id` (or user's default account if None)
- `Transaction.scenario_id == baseline_scenario_id`
- `Transaction.is_deleted.is_(False)`
- `PayPeriod.start_date` within the date range
- Eager load: `Transaction.category`, `Transaction.status`, `Transaction.template`
  (template needed only for `_is_infrequent` check -- no recurrence_rule join needed since
  `due_date` is read directly from the transaction)

## Commit 6: Budget Variance Service Engine (6.5)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(variance): add budget variance analysis service with pay-period, monthly, and annual views
```

### B. Problem statement

The budget variance analysis (6.5) compares estimated vs. actual transaction amounts grouped
by category. Users need to see which categories they consistently overspend or underspend on.
The engine must support three time windows (pay period, month, year) and drill-down from
category group to individual transactions.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/budget_variance_service.py` -- New file: variance computation engine.
- `tests/test_services/test_budget_variance_service.py` -- New file: full test coverage.

### D. Implementation approach

**New service: `app/services/budget_variance_service.py`**

```

**Monthly attribution (updated for Commit 2):** Transactions are attributed to the month of
their `due_date` when available, falling back to `pay_period.start_date` if `due_date` is
null. This is consistent with the scope document section 4.4.2 -- transactions with an
explicit due date are attributed to that date's month, and transactions without one are
attributed to the month of their paycheck date. Now that `due_date` exists on the Transaction
model, this is a simple column read rather than a join.

For the monthly window query:
```python
# Attribute to due_date month when available, else pay_period month.
COALESCE(t.due_date, pp.start_date)
```

**Variance calculation details:**
- For paid/received/settled transactions: `actual = txn.actual_amount or txn.estimated_amount`
  (uses actual when available, falls back to estimated if actual is null).
- For projected transactions: `actual = txn.estimated_amount` (no actual yet, so variance
  is always 0 for individual projected items).
- Percentage: `variance_pct = (variance / estimated) * 100` when estimated != 0, else None.
- Sign convention: positive variance = over budget (spent more than estimated).

## Commit 7: Spending Trend Service Engine (6.7)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(trends): add spending trend detection service with linear regression and threshold flagging
```

### B. Problem statement

The spending trend detection (6.7) computes per-category spending trends over rolling windows,
identifies lifestyle inflation or spending decreases, and flags categories exceeding a
configurable threshold. This builds the analytical engine; the display layer is built later.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/spending_trend_service.py` -- New file: trend detection engine.
- `tests/test_services/test_spending_trend_service.py` -- New file: full test coverage.

### D. Implementation approach

**New service: `app/services/spending_trend_service.py`**

Pure function service -- no Flask imports, no database writes.

**Data structures:**

    group_trends: list[GroupTrend]
    data_sufficiency: str  # "sufficient" | "preliminary" | "insufficient"
```

**Functions:**

```python
def compute_trends(

    """
```

**Window determination:**

Count distinct months with paid expense transactions for the user. If >= 6, use 6-month
window. If >= 3, use 3-month window. The window end is the current month; the window start
is `current_month - window_months`.

**Linear regression implementation:**

The x-values are period indices (0, 1, 2, ...) representing each pay period in the window.
The y-values are total paid expense amounts per period for that category item. The regression
uses Decimal arithmetic (not numpy) to maintain precision with monetary values. This is a
simple OLS fit -- no external dependencies needed.

**Threshold flagging:**

An item is flagged if `abs(pct_change) >= threshold`. Both increases and decreases are
flagged. The threshold is passed in from `user_settings.trend_alert_threshold`.

## Commit 8: Dashboard Service Aggregation Layer

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(dashboard): add dashboard service aggregating balance, bills, alerts, paycheck, goals, and debt data
```

### B. Problem statement

The summary dashboard (8.1) needs a service that aggregates data from multiple existing
services into a single template-ready data structure. Following the established pattern
(savings_dashboard_service, retirement_dashboard_service), the dashboard service takes a
`user_id` and returns plain data.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/dashboard_service.py` -- New file: dashboard data aggregation.
- `tests/test_services/test_dashboard_service.py` -- New file: full test coverage.

### D. Implementation approach

**New service: `app/services/dashboard_service.py`**

```python

    - Compute pct_complete = current / target * 100.

    Returns list of dicts: {name, current_balance, target_amount,
    pct_complete, account_name}.
    """
```

**Section 6: Debt Summary**

Calls `savings_dashboard_service._compute_debt_summary()` logic. Since this is a private
function, extract the debt summary computation into a standalone function
`compute_debt_summary(account_data, escrow_map)` that both the savings dashboard and the
main dashboard can call. Alternatively, make the dashboard service call
`savings_dashboard_service.compute_dashboard_data()` and extract the `debt_summary` key.

**OPTION:** Extract `_compute_debt_summary` into a shared utility to avoid importing the full
savings dashboard computation just for the debt summary. This is cleaner but requires moving
a private function to a public interface.

**Recommended approach:** The dashboard service calls the relevant portions of the savings
dashboard service directly. Since `compute_dashboard_data()` returns the full dict including
`debt_summary`, and the function is already optimized, calling it once and extracting the
needed keys is simpler than extracting sub-functions. The overhead of computing unused
sections is negligible.

**Section 7: Spending Comparison**

```python
def _get_spending_comparison(
    user_id: int, account_id: int, scenario_id: int,
    current_period: PayPeriod, prior_period: PayPeriod | None,
) -> dict:
    """Compare spending between current and prior pay periods.

    delta_pct, direction ('higher'|'lower'|'same')}.
    If no prior period, returns prior_total=None.

## Commit 9: Dashboard Template with All 7 Sections and Interactive Elements

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(dashboard): add summary dashboard page with mark-paid, true-up, and HTMX refresh
```

### B. Problem statement

The dashboard needs a complete template with all 7 sections, interactive mark-as-paid and
true-up actions, and HTMX refresh wiring. This is the largest template commit in the plan.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/dashboard.py` -- New file: dashboard blueprint with mark-paid and refresh
  endpoints.
- `app/templates/dashboard/dashboard.html` -- New file: main dashboard page.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_upcoming_bills.html` -- Bills section with mark-paid buttons.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_alerts.html` -- Alerts section.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_balance_runway.html` -- Balance display with inline true-up.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_payday.html` -- Next payday section.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_savings_goals.html` -- Savings goals with progress bars.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_debt_summary.html` -- Debt summary section.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_spending_comparison.html` -- Period comparison.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_bill_row.html` -- Single bill row partial for HTMX swap.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_mark_paid_form.html` -- Mark-paid inline form.
- `app/templates/dashboard/_true_up_form.html` -- True-up inline form.
- `app/static/js/dashboard.js` -- Dashboard-specific interactions.
- `app/static/css/app.css` -- Dashboard-specific styles.
- `app/__init__.py` -- Register `dashboard_bp` blueprint.
- `tests/test_routes/test_dashboard.py` -- New file: dashboard route tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Dashboard blueprint (`app/routes/dashboard.py`):**

```python
dashboard_bp = Blueprint("dashboard", __name__)

@dashboard_bp.route("/dashboard")
@login_required
def page():
    """Summary dashboard -- the app's landing page."""
    data = dashboard_service.compute_dashboard_data(current_user.id)
    return render_template("dashboard/dashboard.html", **data)

@dashboard_bp.route("/dashboard/mark-paid/<int:txn_id>", methods=["POST"])
@login_required
def mark_paid(txn_id):
    """Mark a bill as paid from the dashboard.

    Delegates to the same transaction mark-done logic as the grid.
    Returns the updated bill row partial for HTMX swap.
    """
    # Same ownership check and status update as transactions.mark_done
    # but returns dashboard/_bill_row.html instead of grid cell

@dashboard_bp.route("/dashboard/bills", methods=["GET"])
@login_required
def bills_section():
    """HTMX partial: refresh the upcoming bills section."""
    # Called after mark-paid to refresh the full bills list

@dashboard_bp.route("/dashboard/balance", methods=["GET"])
@login_required
def balance_section():
    """HTMX partial: refresh the balance/runway section."""
    # Called after true-up to refresh balance display
```

**Mark-as-paid interaction flow:**

1. Each bill row has a "Mark Paid" button with `hx-post="/dashboard/mark-paid/<id>"`.
2. The button includes an optional actual amount input (inline, collapsed by default --
   click to expand, consistent with the grid's quick-edit pattern).
3. On success: the endpoint marks the transaction as done/received (using the same logic as
   `transactions.mark_done`), then returns the updated `_bill_row.html` partial with the
   transaction in "paid" visual state (struck through, muted).
4. The response includes `HX-Trigger: dashboardRefresh` to refresh the balance and spending
   sections (since marking a bill paid affects the projected balance).
5. On the next full page load, paid bills no longer appear (they fail the "not settled"
   filter).

**True-up interaction flow:**

1. The balance display in Section 3 has a clickable balance amount (same pattern as the grid).
2. Click triggers `hx-get="/accounts/<id>/anchor-form"` -> reuses the existing accounts
   endpoint to render the edit form.
3. On save: `hx-patch="/accounts/<id>/true-up"` -> reuses the existing true-up endpoint.
4. The response triggers `HX-Trigger: balanceChanged` which the dashboard listens for to
   refresh the balance section.

**Template structure (`dashboard/dashboard.html`):**

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="container-fluid py-3">
  <div class="row g-3">
    <!-- Section 1: Upcoming Bills (col-lg-8) -->
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <div class="card" id="bills-section">
        <div class="card-header d-flex justify-content-between">
          <h5 class="mb-0">Upcoming Bills</h5>
          <a href="{{ url_for('grid.index') }}" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">
            Open Grid</a>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body p-0">
          {% include "dashboard/_upcoming_bills.html" %}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Alerts (col-lg-4) -->
    <div class="col-lg-4">
      {% include "dashboard/_alerts.html" %}
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Balance & Runway (col-md-6 col-lg-3) -->
    <!-- Section 4: Payday (col-md-6 col-lg-3) -->
    <!-- Section 5: Savings Goals (col-lg-6) -->
    <!-- Section 6: Debt Summary (col-md-6 col-lg-3) -->
    <!-- Section 7: Spending Comparison (col-md-6 col-lg-3) -->
  </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

**HTMX refresh wiring:**

```html
<div id="bills-section"
     hx-get="{{ url_for('dashboard.bills_section') }}"
     hx-trigger="dashboardRefresh from:body"
     hx-swap="innerHTML">
```

The `dashboardRefresh` event is triggered by mark-paid responses. The `balanceChanged` event
(from true-up) triggers refresh of the balance section.

**Dark mode:** All new CSS uses the existing custom properties (`--shekel-surface`,
`--shekel-text-primary`, etc.). Progress bars use Bootstrap's built-in dark mode support.
Alert severity colors use the established `--shekel-danger`, `--shekel-done` variables.

**Mobile:** The responsive grid uses `col-lg-*` and `col-md-*` so sections stack vertically
on narrow screens. Bills display as a list (no table) for mobile compatibility. Mark-paid
buttons are touch-target sized (min 44x44px).

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Navigate to `/dashboard`. Verify all 7 sections render with data.
2. Click "Mark Paid" on a bill. Verify the row transitions to paid state (struck through).
3. Verify the balance section refreshes after marking paid.
4. Click the balance amount. Verify the inline edit form appears. Enter a new balance and
   submit. Verify the balance updates and the "as of" date changes.
5. Verify the "Open Grid" link navigates to the budget grid.
6. Verify savings goal progress bars show correct percentages.
7. Test at 375px width. Verify sections stack vertically, bills are readable, mark-paid
   buttons are tappable.
8. Toggle dark mode. Verify all sections render correctly.

### G. Downstream effects

- The dashboard blueprint is registered but `/` still points to the grid. The route swap
  happens in Commit 10.

### H. Rollback notes

Remove `dashboard_bp` from `__init__.py`, delete all new dashboard files. No migration.

## Commit 10: Default Route Swap and Nav Bar Update

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(dashboard): make dashboard the default route, move grid to /grid
```

### B. Problem statement

The dashboard must become the app's landing page (`/`). The grid must move to `/grid`. The
nav bar must reflect these changes.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/grid.py` -- Change the grid's route from `/` to `/grid`.
- `app/routes/dashboard.py` -- Add `/` as an additional route for the dashboard page.
- `app/templates/base.html` -- Update nav bar: add "Dashboard" as first item pointing to `/`,
  update "Budget" to point to `/grid`.
- `tests/test_routes/test_grid.py` -- Update URL references from `/` to `/grid`.
- `tests/test_routes/test_dashboard.py` -- Add test for `/` route.

### D. Implementation approach

**Grid route change:**

In `app/routes/grid.py`, change `@grid_bp.route("/")` (line 133) to `@grid_bp.route("/grid")`.
Also update any `url_for("grid.index")` references in templates that construct the URL.

Grep the entire codebase for `url_for('grid.index')` and `url_for("grid.index")` to find all
references. Update each one -- the generated URL will automatically change since the route
mapping changed, but any hardcoded `/` paths in HTMX attributes or redirects need updating.

**Dashboard route addition:**

Add `@dashboard_bp.route("/")` as an additional decorator on the dashboard page function. The
dashboard is now accessible at both `/` and `/dashboard`.

**Nav bar update:**

In `base.html`, update the nav items:
1. **Dashboard** (new) -> `url_for('dashboard.page')` -> `/dashboard`
2. **Budget** -> `url_for('grid.index')` -> `/grid`
3. (remaining items unchanged)

Active detection for "Dashboard": `request.path in ('/', '/dashboard')`.
Active detection for "Budget": `request.path.startswith('/grid')`.

### E. Test cases

| ID | Test name | Setup | Action | Expected | New/Mod |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| C10- | test_root_serves_dashboard | auth_client | GET / | 200, contains "Upcoming Bills" | New |
| C10- | test_grid_at_new_url | auth_client, seed_user | GET /grid | 200, contains grid content | New |
| C10- | test_old_grid_url_gone | auth_client | GET / | Does NOT contain grid table | New |
| C10- | test_nav_has_dashboard | auth_client | GET /grid | Nav contains "Dashboard" link | New |
| C10- | test_nav_budget_points_to_grid | auth_client | GET / | "Budget" link href="/grid" | New |
| C10- | test_grid_redirect_after_baseline | client, no scenario | POST /grid/create-baseline | Redirects to /grid | Mod |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Open browser, navigate to app root. Verify the dashboard loads (not the grid).
2. Click "Budget" in nav bar. Verify the grid loads at `/grid`.
3. Click "Dashboard" in nav bar. Verify the dashboard loads.
4. Verify the nav item highlighting: "Dashboard" is active on `/`, "Budget" is active on
   `/grid`.
5. Bookmark `/` and `/grid`. Reload both. Verify correct pages load.

### G. Downstream effects

- All internal links that previously pointed to `/` for the grid now point to `/grid`.
- The onboarding flow in `__init__.py` that checks various setup steps may redirect to `/`
  which now serves the dashboard. Verify the onboarding banner still works correctly.
- External bookmarks to `/` now get the dashboard instead of the grid. This is intentional.

### H. Rollback notes

Revert route changes, revert nav bar. Grid returns to `/`. No migration.

## Commit 11: Calendar Display Layer (8.2 + 6.6 Display)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(calendar): add month detail and year overview calendar views to analytics page
```

### B. Problem statement

The calendar tab on the analytics page needs two views: a month detail calendar (7-column
grid with transaction markers) and a year overview (4x3 grid with monthly totals). Navigation
between views and months must work via HTMX.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/analytics.py` -- Replace calendar tab placeholder with real endpoint.
- `app/templates/analytics/_calendar_month.html` -- New: month detail view.
- `app/templates/analytics/_calendar_year.html` -- New: year overview.
- `app/static/js/calendar.js` -- New: tooltip/popover interactions for day cells.
- `app/static/css/app.css` -- Calendar grid styles.
- `tests/test_routes/test_analytics.py` -- Add calendar tab tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Analytics route updates:**

```python
@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/calendar")
@login_required
def calendar_tab():
    """HTMX partial: calendar tab content."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))

    view = request.args.get("view", "month")  # "month" or "year"
    year = request.args.get("year", type=int, default=date.today().year)
    month = request.args.get("month", type=int, default=date.today().month)
    account_id = request.args.get("account_id", type=int)

    settings = UserSettings.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id).one()
    threshold = settings.large_transaction_threshold

    if view == "year":
        data = calendar_service.get_year_overview(
            current_user.id, year, account_id, threshold)
        return render_template("analytics/_calendar_year.html",
                               data=data, year=year)
    else:
        data = calendar_service.get_month_detail(
            current_user.id, year, month, account_id, threshold)
        return render_template("analytics/_calendar_month.html",
                               data=data, year=year, month=month)
```

**Month detail template (`_calendar_month.html`):**

A 7-column CSS grid (Sun-Sat) with one row per week:

```html
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-3">
  <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary"
          hx-get="{{ url_for('analytics.calendar_tab', view='month',
                    year=prev_year, month=prev_month) }}"
          hx-target="#tab-content" hx-swap="innerHTML">
    <i class="bi bi-chevron-left"></i> Prev
  </button>
  <h5 class="mb-0">{{ month_name }} {{ year }}</h5>
  <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary"
          hx-get="{{ url_for('analytics.calendar_tab', view='month',
                    year=next_year, month=next_month) }}"
          hx-target="#tab-content" hx-swap="innerHTML">
    Next <i class="bi bi-chevron-right"></i>
  </button>
</div>
<button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary mb-3"
        hx-get="{{ url_for('analytics.calendar_tab', view='year', year=year) }}"
        hx-target="#tab-content" hx-swap="innerHTML">
  <i class="bi bi-zoom-out"></i> Year Overview
</button>

<div class="calendar-grid">
  <!-- Day header row: Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat -->
  <!-- Day cells with transaction markers -->
  {% for day in month_days %}
  <div class="calendar-day {% if day.is_paycheck_day %}calendar-paycheck{% endif %}"
       {% if day.entries %}
       data-bs-toggle="popover"
       data-bs-trigger="hover focus"
       data-bs-html="true"
       data-bs-content="{{ day.popover_html }}"
       {% endif %}>
    <span class="calendar-day-number">{{ day.number }}</span>
    {% for entry in day.entries[:3] %}
    <span class="calendar-marker
      {% if entry.is_income %}calendar-income{% else %}calendar-expense{% endif %}
      {% if entry.is_large %}calendar-large{% endif %}"
      title="{{ entry.name }}: ${{ entry.amount }}">
    </span>
    {% endfor %}
    {% if day.entries|length > 3 %}
    <span class="calendar-more">+{{ day.entries|length - 3 }}</span>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

Each day cell shows small colored dots for transactions (green=income, red/pink=expense).
Large or infrequent transactions get a distinct marker style (ring or larger dot). Paycheck
days get a highlighted background. Hovering/clicking shows a Bootstrap popover with
transaction names and amounts.

**Year overview template (`_calendar_year.html`):**

A 4x3 grid of month cards:

```html
<div class="row row-cols-2 row-cols-md-3 row-cols-lg-4 g-3">
  {% for month in data.months %}
  <div class="col">
    <div class="card calendar-month-card
      {% if month.net < 0 %}border-danger{% elif month.net > month.total_income * 0.8 %}border-warning{% else %}border-success{% endif %}"
         hx-get="{{ url_for('analytics.calendar_tab', view='month',
                   year=data.year, month=month.month) }}"
         hx-target="#tab-content" hx-swap="innerHTML"
         role="button">
      <div class="card-body p-2">
        <h6>{{ month_name(month.month) }}
          {% if month.is_third_paycheck_month %}
          <span class="badge bg-info">3rd check</span>
          {% endif %}
        </h6>
        <small class="text-success">+${{ month.total_income }}</small><br>
        <small class="text-danger">-${{ month.total_expenses }}</small><br>
        <strong>Net: ${{ month.net }}</strong>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

Month cards are color-coded: green border for net-positive, yellow for tight, red for
net-negative. Clicking a month navigates to its detail view via HTMX.

**Calendar CSS:**

```css
.calendar-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
  gap: 1px;
  background-color: var(--shekel-border-subtle);
}
.calendar-day {
  background-color: var(--shekel-surface);
  min-height: 5rem;
  padding: 0.25rem;
}
.calendar-paycheck {
  background-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--shekel-surface), #2ECC71 8%);
}
.calendar-marker {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
.calendar-income { background-color: var(--shekel-done); }
.calendar-expense { background-color: var(--shekel-danger); }
.calendar-large {
  width: 10px;
  height: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--shekel-text-muted);
}
```

**Mobile:** On `<768px`, the calendar grid shrinks. Day numbers remain visible but marker dots
are smaller. The year overview uses `row-cols-2` for a 2-column layout on small screens.

2. Click forward/back buttons. Verify month changes via HTMX swap.
3. Hover a day with transactions. Verify popover shows names and amounts.
4. Click "Year Overview". Verify 4x3 grid with monthly totals.
5. Click a month card. Verify navigation to that month's detail view.
6. Verify 3rd paycheck months have the badge.
7. Verify large transaction markers are visually distinct.
8. Test at 375px width. Verify calendar is readable and year overview uses 2 columns.
9. Toggle dark mode. Verify all calendar elements render correctly.

### G. Downstream effects

None. This replaces the calendar tab placeholder from Commit 3.

### H. Rollback notes

Revert analytics route to placeholder, delete new templates and JS. No migration.

## Commit 12: Due Date UI -- Template Form and Transaction Override

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(ui): add due_day_of_month to template form and due_date override to transaction edit
```

### B. Problem statement

The `due_day_of_month` column (Commit 2) exists on RecurrenceRule but has no UI to set it.
The `due_date` column exists on Transaction but has no UI to override it. This commit adds:
(1) an optional "Due date differs from scheduled date" section to the template create/edit
form, and (2) an editable `due_date` field to the transaction full-edit popover and grid

- `tests/test_routes/test_transactions.py` -- Add due_date override tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Template form (`templates/form.html`):**

Add a new section inside the `#recurrence-fields` container, visible only when a pattern with
`day_of_month` is selected (Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-Annual, Annual):

```html
<div id="due-day-group" class="mb-2 d-none">
  <div class="form-check">
    <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="due_day_differs"
           {{ 'checked' if template and template.recurrence_rule and
              template.recurrence_rule.due_day_of_month else '' }}>
    <label class="form-check-label" for="due_day_differs">
      Due date differs from scheduled date
    </label>
  </div>
  <div id="due-day-input" class="mt-2 {{ '' if template and template.recurrence_rule and
       template.recurrence_rule.due_day_of_month else 'd-none' }}">
    <label class="form-label mb-0 small">Due day of month</label>
    <input type="number" name="due_day_of_month" min="1" max="31"
           class="form-control form-control-sm"
           value="{{ template.recurrence_rule.due_day_of_month or ''
                    if template and template.recurrence_rule else '' }}"
           placeholder="1-31">
    <small class="form-text text-muted">
      If the bill is drafted on the 22nd but due on the 1st of the next month,
      enter 1 here. Dates earlier than the scheduled day are assumed to be next month.
    </small>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Recurrence form JS (`recurrence_form.js`):**

Add logic to `updateFields()`:
- Show `#due-day-group` when the selected pattern uses `day_of_month` (MONTHLY, QUARTERLY,
  SEMI_ANNUAL, ANNUAL).
- Hide it for other patterns.
- Toggle `#due-day-input` visibility based on the checkbox state.
- When the checkbox is unchecked, clear the `due_day_of_month` input value.

```javascript
// Inside updateFields():
var dueGroup = document.getElementById('due-day-group');
var dueInput = document.getElementById('due-day-input');
var dueCheck = document.getElementById('due_day_differs');
if (showsDayOfMonth) {
  dueGroup.classList.remove('d-none');
} else {
  dueGroup.classList.add('d-none');
}

dueCheck.addEventListener('change', function() {
  if (this.checked) {
    dueInput.classList.remove('d-none');
  } else {
    dueInput.classList.add('d-none');
    document.querySelector('input[name="due_day_of_month"]').value = '';
  }
});
```

**Template route changes (`templates.py`):**

In `create_template()` (line ~94-180): Extract `due_day_of_month` from validated data when
creating or updating the RecurrenceRule. Add to the rule creation:

```python
if due_day_of_month is not None:
    rule.due_day_of_month = due_day_of_month
```

In `update_template()` (line ~218-318): Same pattern. If the checkbox is unchecked (field is
empty/None), set `rule.due_day_of_month = None`.

**Transaction full-edit popover (`_transaction_full_edit.html`):**

Add a `due_date` field after the Notes field (line 58):

```html
{# Due date (read-only by default, editable on toggle) #}
{% if txn.due_date %}
<div class="mb-2">
  <label class="form-label mb-0 small d-flex justify-content-between">
    Due Date
    <a href="#" class="small" data-action="toggle-due-date"
       title="Override due date">
      <i class="bi bi-pencil-square"></i>
    </a>
  </label>
  <div id="due-date-display-{{ txn.id }}">
    <small class="text-muted">{{ txn.due_date.strftime('%-m/%-d/%Y') }}</small>
  </div>
  <div id="due-date-edit-{{ txn.id }}" class="d-none">
    <input type="date" name="due_date"
           value="{{ txn.due_date.isoformat() }}"
           class="form-control form-control-sm">
  </div>
</div>
{% endif %}
```

The pencil icon toggles between display and edit mode via a small JS handler in `grid_edit.js`
(or inline via `data-action` pattern already used for close-popover).

**Transaction cell display (`_transaction_cell.html`):**

Add due date to the tooltip content (the `title` attribute on the cell). Currently shows
amount and status. Add due date when it differs from the period start:

```html
{% if txn.due_date and txn.due_date != txn.pay_period.start_date %}
  <small class="d-block text-muted">Due: {{ txn.due_date.strftime('%-m/%-d') }}</small>
{% endif %}
```

**Transaction PATCH endpoint (`transactions.py`):**

In `update_transaction()` (line 118-191), add handling for `due_date` in the update data:

```python
if "due_date" in data:
    txn.due_date = data["due_date"]
    # For transfer shadows, propagate to both shadows.
    if txn.transfer_id is not None:
        transfer_service.update_transfer(
            txn.transfer_id, current_user.id, due_date=data["due_date"]
        )
```

### E. Test cases

| ID | Test name | Setup | Action | Expected | New/Mod |

| C12-12 | test_regeneration_updates_due_dates | Template with due_day_of_month, update amount | POST update template | Regenerated txns have correct due_dates | New |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Create a new template with Monthly pattern, day_of_month=22. Check the "Due date differs"
   checkbox. Enter due_day_of_month=1. Save. Verify the generated transactions have
   `due_date` on the 1st of the month after the 22nd.
2. Edit the template. Uncheck the checkbox. Save. Verify `due_day_of_month` is cleared and
   regenerated transactions have `due_date` matching `day_of_month`.
3. In the grid, click a transaction cell. Open full edit. Verify due date is shown. Click the
   pencil icon. Verify the date picker appears. Change the date. Save. Verify the override
   persists.
4. Verify the transaction cell shows "Due: M/D" for transactions where due_date differs from
   the period start.
5. Test at 375px width. Verify the due date field in full edit is usable.

### G. Downstream effects

- Templates with `due_day_of_month` set will generate transactions with correct `due_date`
  values that differ from the pay period scheduling date.
- The calendar (Commit 11) will display these transactions on the correct day.
- The dashboard (Commit 9) will sort bills by the correct due date.

### H. Rollback notes

Revert template, JS, and route changes. The `due_day_of_month` column remains in the database
(added by Commit 2's migration) but is unused. No data loss.

## Commit 13: Year-End Summary Service Engine (8.3)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(year-end): add year-end summary service aggregating income, taxes, spending, transfers, net worth, and debt progress
```

### B. Problem statement

The year-end financial summary (8.3) needs a service that aggregates a full calendar year of
financial data: income and tax breakdowns (W-2 line items), spending by category, transfer
summaries, net worth trend, debt progress, and savings progress.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/year_end_summary_service.py` -- New file.
- `tests/test_services/test_year_end_summary_service.py` -- New file.

### D. Implementation approach

**New service: `app/services/year_end_summary_service.py`**

```python
def compute_year_end_summary(user_id: int, year: int) -> dict:
    """Aggregate annual financial data for the specified calendar year.

    Returns dict with keys:
    - income_tax: dict with gross_wages, federal_tax, state_tax, ss_tax,
      medicare_tax, pretax_deductions (list), posttax_deductions (list),
      net_pay_total, mortgage_interest_total
    - spending_by_category: list of {group_name, group_total, items: [{item_name,
      item_total}]}
    - transfers_summary: list of {destination_account, total_amount}
    - net_worth: {monthly_values: list of 12 {month, balance}, jan1, dec31, delta}
    - debt_progress: list of {account_name, jan1_balance, dec31_balance,
      principal_paid}
    - savings_progress: list of {account_name, jan1_balance, dec31_balance,
      total_contributions}
    """
```

**Income/Tax section:**

Query all pay periods in the calendar year. For each, call
`paycheck_calculator.calculate_paycheck()` for each active salary profile. Sum across all
periods:
- `gross_wages` = sum of `breakdown.gross_biweekly`
- `federal_tax` = sum of `breakdown.federal_tax`
- `state_tax` = sum of `breakdown.state_tax`
- `ss_tax` = sum of `breakdown.social_security`
- `medicare_tax` = sum of `breakdown.medicare`
- Pre-tax deductions: grouped by deduction name, summed across periods
- Post-tax deductions: grouped by deduction name, summed across periods
- `net_pay_total` = sum of `breakdown.net_pay`

**Mortgage interest:**

For each account with `has_amortization=True`, call `amortization_engine.generate_schedule()`
with payment history. Sum the `interest` column for rows whose `payment_date` falls in the
calendar year.

**Spending by category:**

Query paid/settled expense transactions for the year. Group by `category.group_name` then
`category.item_name`. Sum `effective_amount` for each item and group.

**Transfers summary:**

Query transfers in the year's pay periods. Group by `to_account.name`. Sum `amount`.

**Net worth:**

For each of the 12 months, compute the sum of all account balances at month-end. This
requires running the balance calculator for each account type at the last pay period of
each month.

**Debt/savings progress:**

For debt accounts (`has_amortization=True`): compute balance at Jan 1 and Dec 31 using the
amortization engine with payment history. Principal paid = jan1 - dec31.

For savings/investment accounts: compute balance at Jan 1 and Dec 31 using the balance
calculator or growth engine. Total contributions = sum of shadow income transactions
(transfers in) during the year.

## Commit 14: Year-End Summary Display Layer (8.3 Display)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(year-end): add year-end summary view with income/tax breakdown, spending, and net worth chart
```

### B. Problem statement

The year-end summary tab on the analytics page needs a template that renders the service data
as a structured annual report with income/tax breakdown, spending by category, transfer
summary, net worth chart, and debt/savings progress sections.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/analytics.py` -- Replace year-end tab placeholder with real endpoint.
- `app/templates/analytics/_year_end.html` -- New: year-end summary template.
- `app/static/js/chart_year_end.js` -- New: net worth line chart.
- `app/static/css/app.css` -- Year-end specific styles.
- `tests/test_routes/test_analytics.py` -- Add year-end tab tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Analytics route update:**

```python
@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/year-end")
@login_required
def year_end_tab():
    """HTMX partial: year-end financial summary."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))

    year = request.args.get("year", type=int, default=date.today().year)
    data = year_end_summary_service.compute_year_end_summary(current_user.id, year)
    return render_template("analytics/_year_end.html", data=data, year=year)
```

**Template structure:**

Year selector dropdown at the top. Then 6 sections with Bootstrap accordion for expandable
category drill-downs:

1. **Income & Taxes:** Table with W-2-style line items. Each row: label (with optional W-2
   box reference), annual total. Includes gross wages, federal/state/SS/Medicare tax, each
   pre-tax deduction, each post-tax deduction, net pay, and mortgage interest (labeled
   "Mortgage Interest Paid (Schedule A)").

2. **Spending by Category:** Accordion groups. Each group header shows group name and total.
   Expanding shows individual items with their totals.

3. **Transfers Summary:** Simple table: destination account name, total transferred.

4. **Net Worth Trend:** Chart.js line chart with 12 monthly points. Uses `chart_year_end.js`
   with the `ShekelChart.create()` pattern. Displays Jan 1 vs Dec 31 delta prominently.

5. **Debt Progress:** Table: account name, Jan 1 balance, Dec 31 balance, principal paid.

6. **Savings Progress:** Table: account name, Jan 1 balance, Dec 31 balance, contributions.

**Net worth chart JS (`chart_year_end.js`):**

Follows the established pattern -- reads `data-labels` and `data-data` attributes from
canvas element. Single line chart with area fill. Year-aware x-axis labels. Tooltip shows
dollar values.

### E. Test cases

## Commit 15: Budget Variance Display Layer (6.5 Display)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(variance): add budget variance view with bar chart, drill-down table, and time window toggle
```

### B. Problem statement

The variance tab on the analytics page needs a bar chart (estimated vs. actual per category),
a tabular view with drill-down, and a time window toggle (pay period / month / year).

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/analytics.py` -- Replace variance tab placeholder with real endpoint.
- `app/templates/analytics/_variance.html` -- New: variance main template.
- `app/templates/analytics/_variance_detail.html` -- New: category drill-down partial.
- `app/static/js/chart_variance.js` -- New: grouped bar chart.
- `app/static/css/app.css` -- Variance-specific styles.
- `tests/test_routes/test_analytics.py` -- Add variance tab tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Analytics route update:**

```python
@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/variance")
@login_required
def variance_tab():

@login_required
def variance_detail(category_id):
    """HTMX partial: drill-down into a category's transactions."""
    # ... returns _variance_detail.html with transaction-level data
```

**Template:**

Three toggle buttons at top for pay period / month / year. Each triggers an HTMX GET with
the appropriate window type. Below: a Chart.js grouped bar chart (estimated vs actual per
category group) and a table listing each category group and item with expandable rows.

Category rows are clickable (HTMX GET to `variance_detail`) to expand and show individual
transactions.

Conditional color coding: red text for over-budget (positive variance), green for under-budget
(negative variance).

**Chart (`chart_variance.js`):**

Grouped bar chart with two datasets (estimated in blue, actual in green/red based on
over/under). Uses `ShekelChart.create()` pattern. Dollar formatting on y-axis.

## Commit 16: Spending Trends Display Layer (6.7 Display)

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(trends): add spending trend view with top-5 lists and category drill-down
```

### B. Problem statement

The trends tab on the analytics page needs two ranked lists (top 5 trending up, top 5 trending
down), category group drill-down, and a data sufficiency banner.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/analytics.py` -- Replace trends tab placeholder with real endpoint.
- `app/templates/analytics/_trends.html` -- New: trends main template.
- `app/templates/analytics/_trends_detail.html` -- New: group-level drill-down.
- `app/static/css/app.css` -- Trends-specific styles.
- `tests/test_routes/test_analytics.py` -- Add trends tab tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**Analytics route update:**

```python
@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/trends")
@login_required
def trends_tab():
    """HTMX partial: spending trend detection."""
    if not request.headers.get("HX-Request"):
        return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"))

    settings = UserSettings.query.filter_by(user_id=current_user.id).one()
    threshold = settings.trend_alert_threshold
    report = spending_trend_service.compute_trends(current_user.id, threshold)
    return render_template("analytics/_trends.html", report=report)

@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/trends/group/<group_name>")
@login_required
def trends_group_detail(group_name):
    """HTMX partial: group-level trend drill-down."""
    # Returns _trends_detail.html showing all items in the group
```

**Template:**

1. **Data sufficiency banner:** If `report.data_sufficiency == "preliminary"`, show a
   dismissable alert: "Trends are preliminary. At least 3 months of transaction history is
   needed for reliable trend detection." If "insufficient", show: "Not enough data for trend
   analysis. Continue using the app and check back after 3 months."

2. **Two columns on desktop (one on mobile):**
   - Left: "Trending Up" -- top 5 items with red up-arrow, category name (group: item),
     percentage change, dollar change.
   - Right: "Trending Down" -- top 5 items with green down-arrow, category name, percentage
     change, dollar change.

3. **Drill-down:** Clicking a category item triggers an HTMX GET to `trends_group_detail`
   which shows the group-level aggregate trend and all items in that group.

4. **Direction indicators:** Up arrows (`bi-arrow-up-right`) in red/danger color for increases.

## Commit 17: CSV Export for All Analytics Views

### A. Commit message

```text
feat(export): add CSV export endpoints for calendar, year-end, variance, and trends tabs
```

### B. Problem statement

Every tab on the analytics page needs an "Export CSV" button that downloads the current view's
data as a CSV file. The export respects the user's current filters and time window.

### C. Files modified

- `app/services/csv_export_service.py` -- New file: CSV generation.
- `app/routes/analytics.py` -- Add `?format=csv` handling to each tab endpoint.
- `app/templates/analytics/_calendar_month.html` -- Add export button.
- `app/templates/analytics/_calendar_year.html` -- Add export button.
- `app/templates/analytics/_year_end.html` -- Add export button.
- `app/templates/analytics/_variance.html` -- Add export button.
- `app/templates/analytics/_trends.html` -- Add export button.
- `tests/test_services/test_csv_export_service.py` -- New file.
- `tests/test_routes/test_analytics.py` -- Add CSV export tests.

### D. Implementation approach

**CSV service (`app/services/csv_export_service.py`):**

```python
import csv
import io

def export_calendar_csv(data: MonthSummary | YearOverview) -> str:
    """Export calendar data as CSV.

    Columns: Due Date, Name, Category, Amount, Status, Account, Paid At.
    For year overview: one row per transaction across all months.
    """

def export_year_end_csv(data: dict) -> str:
    """Export year-end summary as multi-section CSV.

    Sections separated by blank lines with section headers:
    [Income and Taxes], [Spending by Category], [Transfers],
    [Net Worth Monthly], [Debt Progress], [Savings Progress].
    """

def export_variance_csv(report: VarianceReport) -> str:
    """Export variance data as CSV.

    Columns: Category Group, Category Item, Estimated, Actual,
    Variance ($), Variance (%). Includes transaction-level rows
    beneath each category.
    """

def export_trends_csv(report: TrendReport) -> str:
    """Export trends data as CSV.

    Columns: Category Group, Category Item, Period Average,
    Direction, Change (%), Change ($), Threshold, Flagged.
    """
```

Each function returns a CSV string using Python's `csv` module with `io.StringIO`.

**Route-level CSV handling:**

Each tab endpoint checks for `format=csv` query parameter:

```python
@analytics_bp.route("/analytics/calendar")
@login_required
def calendar_tab():
    # ... existing data loading ...
    if request.args.get("format") == "csv":
        csv_content = csv_export_service.export_calendar_csv(data)
        response = make_response(csv_content)
        response.headers["Content-Disposition"] = (
            f"attachment; filename=calendar_{year}_{month:02d}.csv"
        )
        response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/csv"
        return response
    # ... existing HTML rendering ...
```

**Export buttons in templates:**

```html
<a href="{{ url_for('analytics.calendar_tab', view='month',
           year=year, month=month, format='csv') }}"
   class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">
  <i class="bi bi-download"></i> Export CSV
</a>
```

The CSV download links are regular `<a>` tags (not HTMX) so the browser handles the file
download.

| C17-10 | test_export_calendar_empty | No transactions | export_calendar_csv(empty) | CSV with headers only, no data rows | New |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Navigate to each analytics tab. Click the "Export CSV" button.
2. Verify a CSV file downloads with appropriate filename.
3. Open each CSV in a spreadsheet. Verify columns, data, and formatting.
4. Verify year-end CSV has section headers separating different data blocks.
5. Verify variance CSV includes both category totals and transaction detail rows.

### G. Downstream effects

None. Adds functionality to existing analytics tab endpoints.

### H. Rollback notes

Remove `?format=csv` handling from analytics routes, delete CSV service. No migration.

## Commit 18: Remove Old Charts Route and Templates, Final Cleanup

### A. Commit message

```text
refactor(charts): remove old /charts route, templates, and JS; clean up chart_data_service
```

### B. Problem statement

The old `/charts` route and its 8 templates and 7 JS files are now replaced by the analytics
page and dashboard. They must be removed to eliminate dead code. The `chart_data_service.py`
must be pruned of functions only used by the old charts route, while preserving functions used
by other pages.

### C. Files modified

- `app/routes/charts.py` -- Delete file entirely (or gut and redirect `/charts` to
  `/analytics`).
- `app/__init__.py` -- Remove `charts_bp` registration. Add redirect.
- `app/templates/charts/*.html` -- Delete all 8 template files.
- `app/static/js/chart_balance.js` -- Delete.
- `app/static/js/chart_spending.js` -- Delete.
- `app/static/js/chart_budget.js` -- Delete.
- `app/static/js/chart_amortization.js` -- Delete.
- `app/static/js/chart_net_worth.js` -- Delete.
- `app/static/js/chart_net_pay.js` -- Delete.
- `app/static/js/chart_slider.js` -- Delete.
- `app/services/chart_data_service.py` -- Remove unused functions: `get_balance_over_time`,
  `get_spending_by_category`, `get_budget_vs_actuals`, `_format_period_label`,
  `_get_period_range`, `_get_expense_transactions`. Keep: `get_amortization_breakdown`
  (used by loan dashboard), `get_net_worth_over_time` (used by retirement dashboard),
  `get_net_pay_trajectory` (used by salary pages), `_to_chart_float`,
  `_calculate_account_balances`.
- `app/templates/base.html` -- Remove chart JS `<script>` includes for deleted files.
- `tests/test_routes/test_charts.py` -- Delete or replace with redirect test.
- `tests/test_services/test_chart_data_service.py` -- Remove tests for deleted functions.

### D. Implementation approach

**Redirect for old bookmarks:**

Instead of deleting `charts.py` entirely, keep a minimal redirect:

```python
@charts_bp.route("/charts")
@login_required
def dashboard():
    """Redirect old /charts URL to /analytics."""
    return redirect(url_for("analytics.page"), code=301)
```

This ensures old bookmarks and any external links continue to work.

**Chart data service cleanup:**

Grep the entire codebase for each function name to confirm it is only called from the charts
route before deleting:
- `get_balance_over_time` -- only called in `charts.py`
- `get_spending_by_category` -- only called in `charts.py`
- `get_budget_vs_actuals` -- only called in `charts.py`
- `get_amortization_breakdown` -- called in `loan.py` dashboard
- `get_net_worth_over_time` -- called in `retirement.py`
- `get_net_pay_trajectory` -- called in `salary.py`

**Script include cleanup:**

Remove `<script src>` tags for deleted JS files from `base.html`. The remaining chart JS
files (growth_chart, payoff_chart, retirement_gap_chart, debt_strategy, chart_theme) stay.

### E. Test cases

| ID | Test name | Setup | Action | Expected | New/Mod |
|----|-----------|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| C18-1 | test_charts_redirects_to_analytics | auth_client | GET /charts | 301 redirect to /analytics | New |
| C18-2 | test_chart_fragments_gone | auth_client | GET /charts/balance-over-time (HX) | 301 or 404 | New |
| C18-3 | test_loan_chart_still_works | auth_client, loan account | GET loan dashboard | Amortization chart renders | New |
| C18-4 | test_salary_chart_still_works | auth_client, salary profile | GET salary projection | Net pay chart renders | New |
| C18-5 | test_no_dead_script_includes | auth_client | GET any page | No 404s for deleted JS files | New |
| C18-6 | test_chart_data_service_retained_functions | seed_full_user_data | Call get_amortization_breakdown | Returns valid data | Mod |

### F. Manual verification steps

1. Navigate to `/charts`. Verify 301 redirect to `/analytics`.
2. Navigate to a loan dashboard. Verify the amortization chart still renders.
3. Navigate to salary projection. Verify the net pay chart still renders.
4. Open browser DevTools network tab. Verify no 404 errors for missing JS files.
5. Run `pylint app/ --fail-on=E,F` to confirm no import errors from deleted code.

### G. Downstream effects

- Any bookmarks or external links to `/charts` are redirected.
- The `chart_data_service.py` file shrinks significantly but retains functions used elsewhere.

### H. Rollback notes

Restore deleted files from git history. Re-register `charts_bp`. This is the riskiest
commit to roll back because it deletes multiple files. Before committing, verify all
non-charts pages that use Chart.js still function.

## Opportunities

Optional enhancements identified during the code audit. These are not committed work -- they
are options for the developer to consider during or after implementation.

### OP-1: "Paid on time" indicator on the dashboard

**What:** Compare `paid_at` to `due_date` for each bill in the upcoming bills section. Show a
green check for bills paid before or on the due date, a yellow warning for bills paid 1-3 days
late, and a red indicator for bills paid >3 days late.

**Effort:** ~20 lines of template logic plus 2-3 CSS classes. No new service code -- both
fields are already on the Transaction model.

**Tradeoff:** Adds visual noise to the bills list. Some users may find "late" indicators
discouraging rather than helpful. Could be gated behind a user setting.

### OP-2: Late payment summary in the year-end report

**What:** Add a "Payment Timeliness" section to the year-end summary (Commit 13/14) showing:
total bills paid, bills paid on time, bills paid late, average days before due date.

**Effort:** ~30 lines of service code querying paid transactions where `paid_at > due_date`.
~20 lines of template code.

**Tradeoff:** Requires `paid_at` and `due_date` to be reliably populated. After Commit 2's
backfill, historical data uses `updated_at` as `paid_at` which may not reflect the actual
payment date. This metric becomes more accurate over time as real `paid_at` values accumulate.

### OP-3: Average days-before-due-date metric on spending trends

**What:** Extend the spending trend service (Commit 7) to compute `avg_days_early` per
category -- the average number of days between `paid_at` and `due_date` for paid transactions.
Categories where users consistently pay late may indicate cash flow pressure.

**Effort:** ~20 lines of service code, one new field on `ItemTrend` dataclass.

**Tradeoff:** Same `paid_at` accuracy caveat as OP-2. Only useful after several months of
real payment data accumulates.

### OP-4: Batch `due_day_of_month` setup wizard

**What:** After the template form UI (Commit 12) ships, provide a one-time "Set due dates"
wizard accessible from Settings that lists all monthly/quarterly/annual templates and lets the
user enter `due_day_of_month` for each in a single table view rather than editing templates
one by one.

**Effort:** One new route endpoint, one new template (~50 lines), form handler that bulk-updates
recurrence rules.

**Tradeoff:** Only useful if the user has many templates. For 5-10 templates, editing
individually is fine. For 20+, the batch wizard saves significant time.

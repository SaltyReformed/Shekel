# Phase 8B: Audit & Structured Logging -- Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements Sub-Phase 8B from the Phase 8 Hardening & Ops Plan. It covers PostgreSQL trigger-based audit logging on financial and auth tables, structured JSON application logging enhancements (log event standardization, `X-Request-Id` response header, conditional log levels for request duration), Flask middleware to propagate the application user ID into PostgreSQL sessions, an audit log retention cleanup script, performance benchmarking of the recurrence engine with triggers enabled, and log shipping configuration for Grafana/Loki via Promtail.

**Pre-existing infrastructure discovered during planning:**

- Structured JSON logging with `request_id` is already fully configured in `app/utils/logging_config.py:1-122`. The `RequestIdFilter` class (line 21) injects `g.request_id` into every log record. The `setup_logging()` function (line 42) configures `python-json-logger` with JSON output to stdout and a rotating file handler. Fields emitted: `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `message`, `request_id`.
- Request ID generation is already in place via `_attach_request_id()` (line 100): generates UUID4 per request, stores in `g.request_id` and `g.request_start`.
- Request duration tracking is already in place via `_log_request_summary()` (line 105): logs HTTP method, path, status code, and `request_duration` in milliseconds after every request.
- `python-json-logger==3.3.0` is already installed (`requirements.txt:34`).
- The `system` schema is already created in `app/__init__.py:258-264` (dev/test) and `scripts/init_db.sql` (Docker). It is empty -- no tables exist in it yet.
- Auth routes already log security events with an `action=` prefix pattern in `app/routes/auth.py` (login success line 56, login failure line 63, logout line 73, password change line 98, session invalidation line 121, MFA events lines 194/268/289/350).
- Service modules already use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` for business event logging (balance_calculator, carry_forward_service, credit_workflow, growth_engine, recurrence_engine).
- Docker setup exists (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `entrypoint.sh`) with Gunicorn outputting access logs to stdout, but not in JSON format.
- No audit log table, triggers, or trigger functions exist anywhere in the codebase.
- No `app.current_user_id` PostgreSQL session variable middleware exists.
- No Promtail, Loki, or Grafana configuration files exist.
- No log event standardization (constants/enums for event categories) exists.
- No `X-Request-Id` response header is returned to clients.

**New dependencies required:** None. All required packages are already installed.

**Alembic migration required:** One migration to create `system.audit_log` table, the generic audit trigger function, and trigger attachments on 21 tables.

## Pre-Existing Infrastructure

### 1. Structured JSON Logging -- FULLY IN PLACE

**File:** `app/utils/logging_config.py` (lines 1-122)

| Component                                   | Status    | Location                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `RequestIdFilter` class                     | Active    | `app/utils/logging_config.py:21-30`   |
| JSON formatter (`python-json-logger`)       | Active    | `app/utils/logging_config.py:78-87`   |
| `_attach_request_id()` before_request hook  | Active    | `app/utils/logging_config.py:100-103` |
| `_log_request_summary()` after_request hook | Active    | `app/utils/logging_config.py:105-121` |
| `setup_logging()` called in app factory     | Active    | `app/__init__.py:40`                  |
| `python-json-logger==3.3.0` dependency      | Installed | `requirements.txt:34`                 |

**What this covers (Phase 8B items):**

- Item 8 (JSON logging): ✅ Fully satisfied. JSON output with `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `message`, `request_id`.
- Item 9 (request_id middleware): ✅ Partially satisfied. UUID4 generated and injected into logs. Missing: `X-Request-Id` response header, `user_id` and `remote_addr` not included as standard fields.
- Item 10 (request duration tracking): ✅ Partially satisfied. Duration logged on every request at INFO level. Missing: conditional log level (WARNING for slow requests, DEBUG for fast ones).
- Item 12 (JSON to stdout): ✅ Fully satisfied. Console handler writes to `ext://sys.stdout`.

### 2. System Schema -- CREATED BUT EMPTY

**Files:** `app/__init__.py:258-264`, `scripts/init_db.sql:7`, `tests/conftest.py:60-62`

The `system` schema is created via `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS system` in three places:

- Application factory (dev/test mode)
- Docker entrypoint via `init_db.sql`
- Test setup in `conftest.py`

No tables exist in the schema. The `system.audit_log` table must be created.

### 3. Auth Event Logging -- AD-HOC BUT PRESENT

**File:** `app/routes/auth.py`

| Event                    | Log Line | Level   | Format                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Login success            | Line 56  | INFO    | `"User %s logged in", email`                   |
| Login failure            | Line 63  | WARNING | `"action=login_failed email=%s ip=%s"`         |
| Logout                   | Line 73  | INFO    | `"User %s logged out", current_user.email`     |
| Password change          | Line 98  | INFO    | `"action=password_changed user_id=%s"`         |
| Session invalidation     | Line 121 | INFO    | `"action=sessions_invalidated user_id=%s"`     |
| MFA login success        | Line 194 | INFO    | `"action=mfa_login_success user_id=%s"`        |
| MFA enabled              | Line 268 | INFO    | `"action=mfa_enabled user_id=%s"`              |
| Backup codes regenerated | Line 289 | INFO    | `"action=backup_codes_regenerated user_id=%s"` |
| MFA disabled             | Line 350 | INFO    | `"action=mfa_disabled user_id=%s"`             |

The logging is functional but inconsistent in format. Some use `"User %s logged in"` while others use `"action=login_failed email=%s ip=%s"`. Item 11 (log event standardization) requires unifying these into a consistent structured format with `extra` fields.

### 4. Docker/Gunicorn Configuration -- PARTIAL

**Files:** `Dockerfile:1-47`, `docker-compose.yml:1-54`, `entrypoint.sh:38`

Gunicorn runs with `--access-logfile -` (access logs to stdout) but does not use JSON formatting for access logs. The app's Python logging outputs JSON (via `logging_config.py`), but Gunicorn's native access log format is the default combined format.

### 5. Test Infrastructure -- READY

**File:** `tests/conftest.py`

The test setup creates the `system` schema (line 60) and truncates tables between tests. The truncation list (lines 95-125) covers `salary.*`, `budget.*`, and `auth.*` tables. The `system` schema is not truncated -- this is correct since `system.audit_log` should accumulate during test transactions and be verified by audit-specific tests.

**Update needed:** Add `system.audit_log` to the truncation list in `conftest.py` so audit rows from one test don't leak into another.

---

## Trigger Function Design Decision

**Decision: Single generic PL/pgSQL trigger function with per-table `AFTER` triggers.**

Rationale:

- The Phase 8 plan specifies a "generic audit trigger function" that handles INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE for any table (item 2).
- A single function avoids code duplication across 21 tables. Each table gets a lightweight `CREATE TRIGGER` statement that calls the shared function.
- For UPDATE operations, the function compares `OLD` and `NEW` row values using `jsonb_each()` to record only changed fields. This keeps the audit log compact and queryable.
- The function reads `current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)` to capture the application user. The second argument (`true`) means it returns NULL instead of raising an error when the setting is not defined (e.g., during migrations or direct psql access).
- `row_to_json()` converts OLD/NEW rows to JSONB for generic storage.

No alternative designs were considered because the Phase 8 plan prescribes this approach explicitly.

---

## Gunicorn JSON Access Log Decision

**Decision: Use a custom Gunicorn access log format string rather than a custom logger class.**

Rationale:

- Gunicorn supports a `--access-logformat` flag that accepts format variables (`%(h)s`, `%(l)s`, etc.).
- However, Gunicorn's built-in access log format does not output JSON natively. A truly JSON-formatted access log requires a custom Gunicorn logger class.
- Since the Flask `after_request` hook (`_log_request_summary`) already logs every request in JSON format with method, path, status, and duration, duplicating this in Gunicorn's access log would be redundant.
- **Recommended approach:** Disable Gunicorn's native access log (`--access-logfile ""`) and rely entirely on the Flask-level `_log_request_summary()` for request logging. This produces a single, consistent JSON log stream.
- Add `--error-logfile -` to ensure Gunicorn worker lifecycle messages go to stdout.

This simplifies the logging stack: one JSON stream from the Python application, no separate Gunicorn format to maintain.

---

## Work Units

The implementation is organized into 7 work units. Each unit leaves the app in a working state with all existing tests passing. Dependencies between units are noted.

### Dependency Graph

```
WU-1: Audit Log Migration (table + trigger function + triggers)
  |
  v
WU-2: Flask Middleware (SET LOCAL app.current_user_id)
  |
  v
WU-3: Log Event Standardization (constants + refactor existing logs)
  |
  v
WU-4: Logging Enhancements (X-Request-Id header, user_id/remote_addr fields, slow request thresholds)
  |
  v
WU-5: Audit Cleanup Script (scripts/audit_cleanup.py)
  |
  v
WU-6: Performance Testing (recurrence engine benchmarks)
  |
  v
WU-7: Log Shipping Configuration (Gunicorn, Promtail, runbook)
```

WU-3 and WU-4 are independent of WU-1/WU-2 and could be done in parallel, but are listed sequentially for logical ordering. WU-5, WU-6, and WU-7 depend on earlier units as noted.

---

### WU-1: Audit Log Table, Trigger Function, and Trigger Attachments

**Goal:** Create the `system.audit_log` table, a generic PL/pgSQL audit trigger function, and attach triggers to all 21 financial/auth tables via a single Alembic migration.

**Depends on:** Nothing.

#### Files to Create

**`migrations/versions/<hash>_add_audit_log_and_triggers.py`** -- New Alembic migration.

The migration uses raw SQL via `op.execute()` because Alembic's ORM operations do not support PL/pgSQL functions or trigger creation.

```

Note: The `transfer_templates` table was not listed in the Phase 8 plan's item 3, but it holds the same class of financial data as `transfers` (which _is_ listed). The plan lists `budget.transfers` -- the actual table containing generated transfer instances -- and `transfer_templates` should also be audited for completeness. Both are included. This brings the total to 22 triggers across 22 tables (15 budget, 4 salary, 3 auth).

#### Files to Modify

**`tests/conftest.py`** -- Add `system.audit_log` to the table truncation list.

Current truncation block (after the auth tables, around line 123):

```python
        db.session.execute(db.text(
            "TRUNCATE auth.mfa_configs, auth.user_settings, auth.users CASCADE"
        ))
```

Add after this block:

```python
        # System schema -- clean audit log between tests.
        db.session.execute(db.text(
            "TRUNCATE system.audit_log"
        ))
```

This ensures audit rows from one test do not leak into the next. No `CASCADE` is needed since `audit_log` has no foreign keys.

**`scripts/init_db.sql`** -- No changes needed. The `system` schema is already created. The `audit_log` table and triggers are managed by Alembic.

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `flask db upgrade` applies the migration without errors
- [ ] `pytest` passes (all existing tests)
- [ ] New tests pass (see test plan below)
- [ ] `\dt system.*` in psql shows `audit_log`
- [ ] `\df system.*` in psql shows `audit_trigger_func`

#### New Tests

**`tests/test_integration/test_audit_triggers.py`** -- New test file:

```

#### Impact on Existing Tests

The audit triggers fire on every INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE during tests. This has two effects:

1. **Performance:** Each write operation now also inserts into `system.audit_log`. For the existing test suite (~800+ tests), this adds a small overhead per write. The triggers are lightweight (single INSERT per operation) and should not cause noticeable slowdown.

2. **Data leakage:** Without truncating `system.audit_log` between tests, audit rows would accumulate. The `conftest.py` change above addresses this.

3. **No test logic changes:** No existing test asserts on the `system.audit_log` table or the number of rows in any system table. The triggers are additive and invisible to existing test assertions.

### WU-2: Flask Middleware for `app.current_user_id`

**Goal:** Add a `before_request` hook that executes `SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = '<user_id>'` on the database session so audit triggers can capture the application user.

**Depends on:** WU-1 (triggers must exist to consume the session variable).

#### Files to Modify

**`app/utils/logging_config.py`** -- Add the `SET LOCAL` call inside the existing `_attach_request_id()` before_request hook.

Current (lines 100-103):

```python
    @app.before_request
    def _attach_request_id():
        g.request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        g.request_start = time.perf_counter()
```

New:

```python
    @app.before_request
    def _attach_request_id():
        g.request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        g.request_start = time.perf_counter()

        # Propagate the application user_id into the PostgreSQL session
        # so audit triggers can capture who made the change.
        # Uses SET LOCAL (transaction-scoped, not session-scoped).
        try:
            from flask_login import current_user  # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
            if current_user.is_authenticated:
                from app.extensions import db  # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
                db.session.execute(
                    db.text("SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = :uid"),
                    {"uid": str(current_user.id)},
                )
        except Exception:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
            # Silently skip if outside request context or user not loaded yet.
            pass
```

**Design notes:**

- `SET LOCAL` is transaction-scoped: the setting is automatically cleared when the transaction commits or rolls back. This is safer than `SET` (which is session-scoped and could leak between requests in a connection pool).
- The `try/except` guards against edge cases: requests before Flask-Login is initialized, static file requests, health check endpoints, etc.
- The imports are inside the function to avoid circular imports (the logging module is loaded very early in the app factory).
- Using `db.text()` with a bind parameter prevents SQL injection on the user ID value.

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `pytest` passes (all existing tests)
- [ ] New tests pass (see test plan below)

#### New Tests

**`tests/test_integration/test_audit_triggers.py`** -- Add `TestAuditUserIdCapture` class:

```python
class TestAuditUserIdCapture:
    """Verify that the Flask middleware propagates user_id to audit_log."""

    def test_authenticated_request_captures_user_id(self, app, auth_client, seed_user, seed_periods):
        """An authenticated POST that modifies data records the user_id in audit_log."""

    def test_unauthenticated_request_has_null_user_id(self, app, client, seed_user, seed_periods):
        """Direct database operations without middleware produce user_id=NULL."""

    def test_set_local_is_transaction_scoped(self, app, db, seed_user):
        """SET LOCAL resets after transaction commit -- next transaction has no user_id."""
```

Note: `test_authenticated_request_captures_user_id` creates a transaction via an authenticated POST request (e.g., quick-create a transaction on the budget grid) and then queries `system.audit_log` to verify `user_id` matches `seed_user.id`. This is a route-level integration test.

#### Impact on Existing Tests

The `SET LOCAL` call executes on every authenticated request. In tests:

- The `auth_client` fixture authenticates via `POST /login`, so subsequent requests will set `app.current_user_id`.
- The `SET LOCAL` uses `db.text()` with a bind parameter, so it is safe.
- `TestConfig` disables rate limiting (`RATELIMIT_ENABLED = False`), so the extra SQL call per request has no side effects.
- **No existing tests break.** The `SET LOCAL` is invisible to application logic; it only affects PostgreSQL session variables read by triggers.

---

### WU-3: Log Event Standardization

**Goal:** Define standardized log event categories and a helper function for structured event logging. Refactor existing ad-hoc log calls to use the standardized format.

**Depends on:** Nothing (independent of WU-1/WU-2, but listed here for logical ordering).

#### Files to Create

**`app/utils/log_events.py`** -- New module defining event categories and a structured logging helper.

```python
"""
Shekel Budget App -- Structured Log Event Definitions

structured log entries with consistent fields.  All log events
include the event name and category as structured ``extra`` fields,
making them filterable in Grafana/Loki.
"""
import logging


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Event category constants
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTH = "auth"
BUSINESS = "business"
ERROR = "error"
PERFORMANCE = "performance"


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Structured logging helper
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

def log_event(
    logger: logging.Logger,
    level: int,
    event: str,
    category: str,
    message: str,
    **extra,
):
    """Emit a structured log entry with standardized fields.

        level: Logging level (e.g., ``logging.INFO``).
        event: Machine-readable event name (e.g., ``"login_success"``).
        category: Event category (``AUTH``, ``BUSINESS``, ``ERROR``, ``PERFORMANCE``).

    logger.log(
        level,
        message,
        extra={"event": event, "category": category, **extra},
    )
```

This module intentionally does not define an enum or dataclass for events -- the constants are simple strings, and the `log_event()` helper accepts any event name. This keeps the system flexible and avoids forcing every future log call to register a new enum member.

#### Files to Modify

**`app/routes/auth.py`** -- Refactor existing log calls to use `log_event()`.

Add import at top:

```python
from app.utils.log_events import log_event, AUTH
```

Replace each ad-hoc log call:

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `pytest` passes (all existing tests)
- [ ] New tests pass (see test plan below)

#### New Tests

**`tests/test_utils/test_log_events.py`** -- New test file:

class TestLogEvent:
    """Tests for the log_event() helper."""

    def test_log_event_emits_at_correct_level(self):

#### Impact on Existing Tests

The log message format changes from positional `%s` to structured `extra` fields. Existing tests that assert on log output (if any) would need updating. However, the existing test suite does not assert on log message content -- it tests behavior (HTTP status codes, database state, flash messages). **No existing tests break.**

The `auth_client` fixture logs in via `POST /login`, which now emits a `login_success` event instead of `"User %s logged in"`. Since no test captures or asserts on this log line, the change is invisible.

---

### WU-4: Logging Enhancements

**Goal:** Add `X-Request-Id` response header, include `user_id` and `remote_addr` as standard fields on request summary logs, and implement conditional log levels for slow requests.

**Depends on:** WU-3 (uses the `PERFORMANCE` category constant).

#### Files to Modify

**`app/utils/logging_config.py`** -- Enhance the `_attach_request_id()` and `_log_request_summary()` hooks.

**Change 1:** Add `X-Request-Id` response header. Modify `_log_request_summary()` (lines 105-121):

Current:

```python
    @app.after_request
    def _log_request_summary(response):
        duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - g.request_start) * 1000
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info(
            "%s %s %s",
            request.method,
            request.path,
            response.status_code,
            extra={
                "method": request.method,
                "path": request.path,
                "status": response.status_code,
                "request_duration": round(duration_ms, 2),
            },
        )
        return response
```

New:

```python
    # Slow request threshold in milliseconds (configurable via env var).
    slow_threshold_ms = float(os.getenv("SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS", "500"))

    @app.after_request
    def _log_request_summary(response):
        duration_ms = (time.perf_counter() - g.request_start) * 1000
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        # Return request_id to the client for debugging.
        response.headers["X-Request-Id"] = g.request_id

        # Determine log level based on request duration.
        if duration_ms >= slow_threshold_ms:
            level = logging.WARNING
            event = "slow_request"
            category = "performance"
        else:
            level = logging.DEBUG
            event = "request_complete"
            category = "performance"

        # Include user_id and remote_addr as standard fields.
        extra_fields = {
            "event": event,
            "category": category,
            "method": request.method,
            "path": request.path,
            "status": response.status_code,
            "request_duration": round(duration_ms, 2),
            "remote_addr": request.remote_addr,
        }

        try:
            from flask_login import current_user  # pylint: disable=import-outside-toplevel
            if current_user.is_authenticated:
                extra_fields["user_id"] = current_user.id
        except Exception:  # pylint: disable=broad-except
            pass

        logger.log(
            level,
            "%s %s %s",
            request.method,
            request.path,
            response.status_code,
            extra=extra_fields,
        )
        return response
```

**Design notes:**

- Requests under 500ms are logged at DEBUG (not INFO) to reduce log volume in production. The Phase 8 plan specifies "Log at INFO level for requests over a configurable threshold, DEBUG otherwise." Changed to WARNING for slow requests (more visible in Grafana alerting) and DEBUG for normal requests.
- `remote_addr` is added per the Phase 8 plan's requirement for standard fields.
- `user_id` is included when the user is authenticated, matching the plan's "Standard fields on every log entry: `timestamp`, `level`, `logger`, `message`, `request_id`, `user_id`, `remote_addr`."
- The `slow_threshold_ms` is configurable via `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS` env var (default 500ms).

**`app/config.py`** -- Add `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS` and `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` to BaseConfig:

After `DEFAULT_PAY_CADENCE_DAYS` (line 36):

```python
    # Logging
    SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS = int(
        os.getenv("SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS", "500")
    )

    # Audit
    AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS = int(os.getenv("AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS", "365"))
```

**`.env.example`** -- Add new environment variables after the Gunicorn section:

```
# ── Logging ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# Requests slower than this threshold are logged at WARNING level.
SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS=500

# ── Audit ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# How many days to retain audit_log rows before cleanup.
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=365
```

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `pytest` passes (all existing tests)
- [ ] New tests pass (see test plan below)

#### New Tests

**`tests/test_utils/test_logging_config.py`** -- New test file:

    def test_log_excludes_user_id_when_anonymous(self, app, client):
        """Request summary log does not include user_id for anonymous requests."""
```

#### Impact on Existing Tests

**Log level change:** The `_log_request_summary` now logs at DEBUG for fast requests instead of INFO. If `LOG_LEVEL` is set to INFO in tests, these per-request log lines will no longer appear in test output. This is intentional -- it reduces noise. No test asserts on the log level of request summary lines.

**X-Request-Id header:** All responses now include this header. No existing test asserts that this header is absent, so no breakage.

### WU-5: Audit Cleanup Script

**Goal:** Create a standalone CLI script for purging old audit log rows, intended to be run by cron.

**Depends on:** WU-1 (audit_log table must exist).

#### Files to Create

**`scripts/audit_cleanup.py`** -- Retention cleanup script.

```python
"""
Shekel Budget App -- Audit Log Retention Cleanup

Deletes audit_log rows older than the configured retention period.
Intended to run as a daily cron job.

Usage:
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py [--days N] [--dry-run]

Options:
    --days N     Override retention period (default: AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS env
                 var, or 365 if not set).
    --dry-run    Print the count of rows that would be deleted without
                 actually deleting them.

Examples:
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py                 # Delete rows older than 365 days
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py --days 90       # Delete rows older than 90 days
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py --dry-run       # Preview without deleting

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `pytest` passes (all existing tests)
- [ ] New tests pass (see test plan below)
- [ ] `python scripts/audit_cleanup.py --dry-run` runs without error
- [ ] `python scripts/audit_cleanup.py --days 0` deletes all audit_log rows

#### New Tests

### WU-6: Performance Testing

**Goal:** Benchmark the recurrence engine with and without audit triggers to verify overhead is acceptable (< 20%). If overhead exceeds the threshold, document the approach for temporarily disabling triggers during bulk operations.

### WU-7: Log Shipping Configuration

**Goal:** Configure Gunicorn for clean JSON log output, create a sample Promtail configuration for Grafana/Loki log shipping, update Docker configuration, and document the monitoring setup.

**Depends on:** WU-4 (logging enhancements must be in place).

#### Files to Create

**`monitoring/promtail-config.yml`** -- Sample Promtail configuration for scraping Shekel container logs.

```yaml
# Promtail Configuration for Shekel Budget App
#
# This configuration scrapes JSON logs from the Shekel Docker container
# and ships them to a Loki instance.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Loki running at http://loki:3100 (or adjust the URL below)
#   - Promtail running on the same Docker network as Shekel
#   - Docker socket mounted for container discovery
#
# Setup on Proxmox host:
#   1. Create a docker-compose file for the monitoring stack:
#      - Loki (grafana/loki:latest)
#      - Promtail (grafana/promtail:latest)
#      - Grafana (grafana/grafana:latest)
#
#   2. Mount this config into the Promtail container:
#      volumes:
#        - ./promtail-config.yml:/etc/promtail/config.yml
#        - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
#
#   3. Create a Docker network shared between the monitoring stack
#      and the Shekel stack:
#      docker network create monitoring
#
#   4. Add the monitoring network to both docker-compose files:
#      networks:
#        monitoring:
#          external: true
#
#   5. In Grafana, add Loki as a data source:
#      URL: http://loki:3100
#
#   6. Useful LogQL queries for Shekel:
#      - All auth events:     {container="shekel-app"} | json | category="auth"
#      - Login failures:      {container="shekel-app"} | json | event="login_failed"
#      - Slow requests:       {container="shekel-app"} | json | event="slow_request"
#      - Errors:              {container="shekel-app"} | json | level="ERROR"

**`monitoring/README.md`** -- Monitoring stack setup runbook.

```markdown
# Shekel Monitoring Stack Setup

## Overview

Shekel outputs structured JSON logs to stdout. These logs are scraped by
Promtail and shipped to Loki for querying via Grafana.

## Architecture
```

Shekel App (JSON stdout) → Docker log driver → Promtail → Loki → Grafana

````

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose on the Proxmox host
- Shekel stack running via `docker-compose.yml`

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create the monitoring network

```bash
docker network create monitoring
````

### 2. Add the network to Shekel's docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  app:
    networks:
      - default
      - monitoring

networks:
  monitoring:
    external: true
```

### 3. Create monitoring docker-compose.yml

Save this as `monitoring/docker-compose.yml` on the Proxmox host:

```yaml
services:
  loki:
    image: grafana/loki:latest
    container_name: loki
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3100:3100"
    volumes:
      - loki-data:/loki
    networks:
      - monitoring

  promtail:
    image: grafana/promtail:latest
    container_name: promtail
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./promtail-config.yml:/etc/promtail/config.yml
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    depends_on:
      - loki
    networks:
      - monitoring

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    container_name: grafana
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana
    environment:
      GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD: ${GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}
    depends_on:
      - loki
    networks:
      - monitoring

volumes:
  loki-data:
  grafana-data:

networks:
  monitoring:
    external: true
```

### 4. Start the monitoring stack

```bash
cd monitoring
docker compose up -d
```

### 5. Configure Grafana

1. Open http://<proxmox-ip>:3000
2. Log in (admin / admin, change password)
3. Add Data Source → Loki → URL: http://loki:3100
4. Go to Explore → Select Loki → Run queries

### Useful LogQL Queries

| Purpose         | Query                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| All auth events | `{container="shekel-app"} \| json \| category="auth"`      |
| Login failures  | `{container="shekel-app"} \| json \| event="login_failed"` |
| Slow requests   | `{container="shekel-app"} \| json \| event="slow_request"` |
| All errors      | `{container="shekel-app"} \| json \| level="ERROR"`        |
| Specific user   | `{container="shekel-app"} \| json \| user_id="1"`          |
| Trace a request | `{container="shekel-app"} \| json \| request_id="<uuid>"`  |

## Troubleshooting

- **No logs in Grafana:** Check that `docker logs shekel-app` shows JSON output. Verify Promtail container can see the Shekel container (`docker logs promtail`).
- **Promtail can't discover containers:** Ensure `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted in the Promtail container.
- **Network issues:** Verify both stacks share the `monitoring` network (`docker network inspect monitoring`).

````

#### Files to Modify

**`entrypoint.sh`** -- Update Gunicorn command to disable the native access log and ensure error log goes to stdout.

Current (line 38):

```bash
exec gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers "${GUNICORN_WORKERS:-2}" --access-logfile - run:app
````

New:

```bash
exec gunicorn \
    --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 \
    --workers "${GUNICORN_WORKERS:-2}" \
    --access-logfile "" \
    --error-logfile - \
    --log-level info \
    run:app
```

Explanation:

- `--access-logfile ""` disables Gunicorn's native access log (redundant with Flask's `_log_request_summary()` which outputs JSON).
- `--error-logfile -` sends Gunicorn worker lifecycle messages (start, stop, restart) to stderr/stdout.
- `--log-level info` sets Gunicorn's internal log level.

**`docker-compose.yml`** -- Add `SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS`, `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `LOG_LEVEL` environment variables.

Add to the `app.environment` section (after line 46):

```yaml
LOG_LEVEL: ${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}
SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS: ${SLOW_REQUEST_THRESHOLD_MS:-500}
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS: ${AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS:-365}
TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY: ${TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY:?Set TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY in .env}
```

Note: `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` was missing from the production docker-compose environment but is required by ProdConfig. Adding it here ensures production deployments fail fast if the key is not set.

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `pytest` passes (all existing tests)
- [ ] `docker compose config` validates the updated docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Gunicorn starts with the new flags (no native access log output)
- [ ] `monitoring/promtail-config.yml` is valid YAML

#### New Tests

No new automated tests for WU-7. The deliverables are configuration files and documentation. Manual verification:

1. Build and run the Docker container; verify `docker logs shekel-app` shows only JSON lines (no Gunicorn access log lines).
2. Verify the Promtail config is valid YAML.
3. (Optional, on Proxmox) Deploy the monitoring stack and verify logs appear in Grafana.

#### Impact on Existing Tests

None. Docker configuration changes do not affect the test suite (tests run with `flask run`, not Gunicorn). The `entrypoint.sh` change is Docker-only.

---

## Complete Test Plan

### Existing Tests (no changes required)

All existing tests continue to pass without modification across all 7 work units. The key reasons:

1. **Triggers are additive.** They insert into `system.audit_log` but do not change any application table behavior or return values.
2. **`system.audit_log` is truncated between tests** (added in WU-1 conftest change).
3. **`SET LOCAL` is transaction-scoped.** It resets automatically and does not affect subsequent queries.
4. **Log format changes are invisible to tests.** No existing test asserts on log message content or format.
5. **`X-Request-Id` header is additive.** No existing test asserts on its absence.
6. **Request log level change (INFO→DEBUG for fast requests)** does not affect test behavior.

## Phase 8B Test Gate Checklist (Expanded)

From the Phase 8 plan's test gate (lines 274-283), mapped to specific tests:

- [ ] **`pytest` passes (all existing tests)**
  - Verified: triggers are additive, `system.audit_log` truncated between tests, no test logic changes.

- [ ] **Audit triggers fire: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `budget.transactions` produce rows in `system.audit_log`**
  - `TestAuditTriggerInsert.test_insert_transaction_creates_audit_row`
  - `TestAuditTriggerUpdate.test_update_transaction_creates_audit_row`
  - `TestAuditTriggerDelete.test_delete_transaction_creates_audit_row`

- [ ] **Audit log captures changed_fields on UPDATE (only the columns that changed)**
  - `TestAuditTriggerUpdate.test_update_captures_changed_fields`
  - `TestAuditTriggerUpdate.test_update_no_change_skips_audit`

- [ ] **Audit log captures user_id from the application context**
  - `TestAuditUserIdCapture.test_authenticated_request_captures_user_id`
  - `TestAuditUserIdCapture.test_unauthenticated_request_has_null_user_id`

- [ ] **`scripts/audit_cleanup.py` deletes rows older than the configured retention period**
  - `TestAuditCleanup.test_cleanup_deletes_old_rows`
  - `TestAuditCleanup.test_cleanup_preserves_recent_rows`
  - `TestAuditCleanup.test_cleanup_returns_correct_count`

- [ ] **Application logs output structured JSON in production config**
  - Pre-existing: `app/utils/logging_config.py` already outputs JSON via `python-json-logger`. Verified in pre-existing infrastructure audit.

- [ ] **Every log entry includes request_id, timestamp, level**
  - Pre-existing: `RequestIdFilter` (line 21), `JsonFormatter` with `timestamp=True` (line 86), `level` field renamed from `levelname` (line 83).
  - `TestRequestIdHeader.test_x_request_id_is_uuid4`

- [ ] **Request duration is logged for every request**
  - Pre-existing: `_log_request_summary()` (line 107) logs `request_duration` in milliseconds.
  - `TestRequestDurationLogLevel.test_fast_request_logs_at_debug`
  - `TestRequestDurationLogLevel.test_slow_request_logs_at_warning`

- [ ] **Auth events (login, logout, password change) appear in logs**
  - `TestLogEvent.test_log_event_emits_at_correct_level` (verifies the helper works)
  - Manual verification: login/logout/password-change routes use `log_event()` with category=AUTH.

- [ ] **Recurrence engine regeneration with triggers: overhead is acceptable (less than 20% slower)**
  - `TestRecurrenceEngineOverhead.test_generate_for_template_overhead`
  - `TestRecurrenceEngineOverhead.test_regenerate_for_template_overhead`

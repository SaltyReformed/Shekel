# Phase 8C: Backups & Disaster Recovery -- Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements Sub-Phase 8C from the Phase 8 Hardening & Ops Plan. It covers automated PostgreSQL backups with tiered retention, NAS copy, a restore script, backup verification, and a data integrity check script. It also implements the `scripts/integrity_check.py` recommended in the master plan's "Additional Items" section.

**Pre-existing infrastructure discovered during planning:**

- No backup, restore, or retention scripts exist anywhere in the project. All scripts in `scripts/` are Python-based application utilities (seed, init, audit cleanup, MFA reset, benchmark). Phase 8C is entirely additive.
- The Dockerfile (`Dockerfile:24`) already installs `postgresql-client` in the runtime stage, which provides `pg_dump`, `psql`, `pg_isready`, and `pg_restore` inside the app container. No Docker changes needed.
- Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml:11-26`) defines the PostgreSQL service as `db` (container name `shekel-db`) with `postgres:16-alpine`, credentials `shekel_user` / `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}`, database `shekel`, and a named volume `pgdata`.
- The `DATABASE_URL` is constructed in `docker-compose.yml:38` as `postgresql://shekel_user:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db:5432/shekel`. Individual components are also passed as `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` (`docker-compose.yml:39-42`).
- The entrypoint (`entrypoint.sh:8-15`) already uses `pg_isready` and `psql` with these `DB_*` environment variables, establishing the pattern for how shell scripts should access the database.
- Five PostgreSQL schemas exist: `ref`, `auth`, `budget`, `salary`, `system` (`scripts/init_db.sql:5-9`). The backup must capture all five schemas plus the `public.alembic_version` table.
- The `system.audit_log` table (created in 8B) uses auto-increment `BIGSERIAL` IDs and `TIMESTAMPTZ` columns. It is a key table for backup verification.
- Alembic is configured via `alembic.ini` with `script_location = migrations`. The `scripts/init_database.py` script shows how to invoke Alembic programmatically: `command.upgrade(alembic_cfg, "head")` (`scripts/init_database.py:50-54`). The restore script will use `flask db upgrade` which invokes this same path.
- Existing Python scripts follow a consistent pattern: `sys.path` manipulation, `create_app()` + `app.app_context()` for database access, `argparse` for CLI arguments, Google-style docstrings, core logic separated from CLI wrapper for testability (`scripts/audit_cleanup.py` is the canonical example).
- The `monitoring/README.md:127-130` documents the existing cron pattern for running scripts inside the app container: `docker exec shekel-app python scripts/audit_cleanup.py`. Phase 8C backup scripts will follow the same `docker exec` pattern.
- No NAS mount configuration exists in the project. This is expected -- NAS mounts are host-level and documented in the runbook rather than managed by Docker.
- The test database setup in `tests/conftest.py` uses session-scoped app/db fixtures with table truncation between tests. The `_create_audit_infrastructure()` helper creates the `system.audit_log` table and all audit triggers. Tests for `integrity_check.py` will follow the same pattern as `tests/test_scripts/test_audit_cleanup.py`.

**New dependencies required:** None (shell scripts use standard Unix tools; `integrity_check.py` uses only the existing SQLAlchemy stack).

**Alembic migration required:** None (no schema changes).

## Pre-Existing Infrastructure

### Docker Configuration

| Component | Status | Location | Impact on 8C |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| PostgreSQL service | Running as `db` / `shekel-db` | `docker-compose.yml:12-26` | Backup scripts target this service |
| `postgresql-client` in app image | Installed | `Dockerfile:24` | `pg_dump` and `psql` are available inside `shekel-app` container |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` env vars | Passed to app | `docker-compose.yml:39-42` | Shell scripts inside the container can use these directly |
| `DATABASE_URL` env var | Constructed from components | `docker-compose.yml:38` | Python scripts (integrity check) use this via Flask config |
| Named volume `pgdata` | Database persistence | `docker-compose.yml:56` | Not directly relevant; backup uses `pg_dump`, not volume copy |
| Named volume `applogs` | Log persistence | `docker-compose.yml:57` | Not backed up (logs are ephemeral; Loki handles retention) |

### Database Configuration

| Component | Status | Location | Impact on 8C |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Five schemas: `ref`, `auth`, `budget`, `salary`, `system` | Created by init_db.sql | `scripts/init_db.sql:5-9` | `pg_dump` must use `--schema` flags or dump all schemas |
| `public.alembic_version` table | Tracks migration state | `scripts/init_db.sql:13-16` | Must be included in backup; used by `flask db upgrade` on restore |
| `system.audit_log` table | 8B audit trail | `tests/conftest.py:267-291` (structure) | Key table for backup verification sanity checks |
| Audit triggers on 21 tables | Active | `tests/conftest.py:363-396` (table list) | Triggers are recreated by Alembic migration; not dumped by `pg_dump --data-only` |

### Existing Scripts Convention

| Pattern | Example | Location | Impact on 8C |
|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` for imports | All Python scripts | `scripts/audit_cleanup.py:30` | `integrity_check.py` will follow same pattern |
| `create_app()` + `app.app_context()` | CLI wrapper | `scripts/audit_cleanup.py:124-129` | `integrity_check.py` CLI mode uses same pattern |
| Core logic separated from CLI | `execute_cleanup()` vs `run_cleanup()` | `scripts/audit_cleanup.py:59-129` | `integrity_check.py` exposes testable core functions |
| `argparse` for CLI arguments | `parse_args()` | `scripts/audit_cleanup.py:33-56` | `integrity_check.py` uses `argparse` with `--database-url` override |
| `docker exec` for cron invocation | Documented cron entry | `monitoring/README.md:129` | Backup/restore/verify scripts follow `docker exec` or host-level pattern |

### Entrypoint and Migration Pattern

| Component | Location | Impact on 8C |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `pg_isready` wait loop | `entrypoint.sh:8-10` | Restore script uses same wait pattern after database recreation |
| Schema creation via `psql -f init_db.sql` | `entrypoint.sh:15` | Restore script recreates schemas before `pg_restore` |
| `python scripts/init_database.py` (runs Alembic) | `entrypoint.sh:20` | Restore script runs `flask db upgrade` for pending migrations |
| Alembic config: `script_location = migrations` | `alembic.ini:9` | Programmatic Alembic invocation uses same config |

### Test Infrastructure

| Component | Location | Impact on 8C |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Session-scoped app/db fixtures | `tests/conftest.py:44-88` | `integrity_check.py` tests use same fixtures |
| Table truncation between tests | `tests/conftest.py:97-133` | Tests start with clean database state |
| Audit infrastructure in tests | `tests/conftest.py:259-396` | `system.audit_log` available for integrity check tests |
| Script test pattern | `tests/test_scripts/test_audit_cleanup.py` | Template for `test_integrity_check.py` structure |
| Reference data seeded once | `tests/conftest.py:399-443` | `ref.*` tables are populated; integrity checks can verify them |

---

## Script Execution Context Recommendation

**Decision: Shell scripts run on the Arch Linux host via `docker exec` into the app container. The integrity check Python script runs inside the container.**

### Options Analyzed

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: Scripts on host, `docker exec` into containers** | Cron runs natively on host; NAS mount is host-level; scripts can access both local and NAS paths directly | `pg_dump`/`psql` must run via `docker exec shekel-db`; two-hop execution |
| **B: Scripts inside app container** | `pg_dump`/`psql` already installed; `DB_*` env vars available; single execution context | No access to NAS mount; cron must run inside container or be triggered externally; container restart loses cron |
| **C: Scripts on host with `pg_dump` installed natively** | Direct database access; direct NAS access; simplest cron | Requires installing `postgresql-client` on host; connection goes through Docker network mapping |

**Recommendation: Hybrid approach (Option A+B).**

The shell scripts (`backup.sh`, `backup_retention.sh`, `restore.sh`, `verify_backup.sh`) run **on the Arch Linux host** because:

1. **NAS access:** The NAS mount point (`/mnt/nas/backups/shekel/`) exists on the host filesystem, not inside containers.
2. **Cron scheduling:** Host-level cron (`systemd` timers or crontab) is reliable and persists across container restarts.
3. **Local backup directory:** `/var/backups/shekel/` is a host path.
4. **Container orchestration:** The restore script must stop and restart the app container, which requires host-level Docker access.

Database commands (`pg_dump`, `psql`) are executed via `docker exec shekel-db ...` from within the host scripts. This avoids installing PostgreSQL client tools on the host and ensures version compatibility with the containerized PostgreSQL 16.

The integrity check script (`integrity_check.py`) runs **inside the app container** via `docker exec shekel-app python scripts/integrity_check.py` because it uses SQLAlchemy and the Flask application context, exactly like `audit_cleanup.py`.

---

## NAS Protocol Recommendation

**Decision: Document both NFS and CIFS/SMB. The user selects based on their NAS hardware.**

### NFS

**Pros:** Native Linux support, low overhead, no credential management for trusted networks, better performance for large sequential writes (backup files).

**Cons:** Security relies on IP-based trust (no encryption by default); NFSv4 can add Kerberos but adds complexity.

**Best for:** Synology, TrueNAS, or any NAS on a trusted LAN.

**fstab entry:**
```
nas-ip:/volume1/backups/shekel  /mnt/nas/backups/shekel  nfs  defaults,soft,timeo=150,retrans=3  0  0
```

### CIFS/SMB

**Pros:** Native support on Windows-based NAS devices, credential-based authentication, encrypted transport (SMB3).

**Cons:** Slightly higher overhead than NFS; requires `cifs-utils` package; credential file management.

**Best for:** Windows Server, some QNAP devices, or environments requiring encrypted transport.

**fstab entry:**
```
//nas-ip/backups/shekel  /mnt/nas/backups/shekel  cifs  credentials=/root/.nas-credentials,uid=root,gid=root,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700  0  0
```

Both options are documented in the runbook with verification steps.

---

## Backup Encryption Recommendation

**Decision: Add optional GPG encryption to the backup pipeline.**

### Rationale

The backup files contain the entire database, including:
- User credentials (bcrypt hashes, encrypted TOTP secrets)
- Financial transaction data (amounts, categories, projections)
- Salary and tax information
- Session tokens and MFA backup code hashes

Unencrypted backups on a NAS are a data exposure risk if the NAS is compromised or a backup file is accidentally shared.

### Approach

- **GPG symmetric encryption** (`gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256`) with a passphrase stored in an environment variable (`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE`).
- Encryption is **optional**: if `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` is not set, backups are stored unencrypted (plain `.sql.gz`). If set, the output is `.sql.gz.gpg`.
- The verify and restore scripts detect the `.gpg` extension and decrypt automatically.
- Passphrase is documented in the runbook as a critical secret that must be stored separately from the backups (not on the NAS).

### Tradeoff

| Benefit | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Financial data protected at rest | Passphrase must be managed as a secret |
| NAS compromise does not expose data | Restore requires passphrase; lost passphrase = lost backups |
| Meets data-at-rest security best practices | ~5-10% slower backup due to encryption overhead |
| `gpg` is pre-installed on Arch Linux | Adds complexity to backup/restore/verify scripts |

The cost is minimal and the benefit is significant for financial data. Encryption is implemented but opt-in.

## Integrity Check Scope

Based on analysis of all 35 tables across 5 schemas, the following integrity checks are organized by category.

### Category 1: Referential Integrity (FK Validation)

These checks verify that foreign key references point to existing rows. While PostgreSQL enforces FK constraints on write, data corruption, partial restores, or manual SQL operations could introduce violations.

| Check ID | Table | FK Column | References | Description |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| FK-01 | `budget.accounts` | `user_id` | `auth.users.id` | Accounts without a valid user |
| FK-02 | `budget.accounts` | `account_type_id` | `ref.account_types.id` | Accounts with invalid account type |
| FK-03 | `budget.accounts` | `current_anchor_period_id` | `budget.pay_periods.id` | Accounts pointing to nonexistent anchor period |
| FK-04 | `budget.transactions` | `template_id` | `budget.transaction_templates.id` | Transactions referencing deleted templates (SET NULL should handle this, but verify nulls vs. dangling IDs) |
| FK-05 | `budget.transactions` | `pay_period_id` | `budget.pay_periods.id` | Transactions in nonexistent pay periods |
| FK-06 | `budget.transactions` | `scenario_id` | `budget.scenarios.id` | Transactions in nonexistent scenarios |
| FK-07 | `budget.transactions` | `category_id` | `budget.categories.id` | Transactions with invalid category |
| FK-08 | `budget.transfers` | `from_account_id` | `budget.accounts.id` | Transfers from nonexistent accounts |
| FK-09 | `budget.transfers` | `to_account_id` | `budget.accounts.id` | Transfers to nonexistent accounts |
| FK-10 | `budget.transaction_templates` | `category_id` | `budget.categories.id` | Templates with invalid category |
| FK-11 | `budget.transaction_templates` | `account_id` | `budget.accounts.id` | Templates for nonexistent accounts |
| FK-12 | `salary.salary_profiles` | `scenario_id` | `budget.scenarios.id` | Salary profiles in nonexistent scenarios |
| FK-13 | `salary.salary_profiles` | `template_id` | `budget.transaction_templates.id` | Salary profiles linked to deleted templates |

### Category 2: Orphan Detection

Records that exist but are functionally disconnected from the data model.

| Check ID | Description | SQL Logic |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| OR-01 | Transaction templates with no active recurrence rule and no transactions | Templates where `recurrence_rule_id IS NULL` and no rows in `budget.transactions` reference the template |
| OR-02 | Recurrence rules not referenced by any template | Rules where no `transaction_templates.recurrence_rule_id` or `transfer_templates.recurrence_rule_id` points to them |
| OR-03 | Categories not used by any template or transaction | Categories where no `transaction_templates.category_id` or `transactions.category_id` references them |
| OR-04 | Pay periods with no transactions and no transfers | Periods that have zero transactions and zero transfers (may indicate gaps in recurrence generation) |
| OR-05 | Transfer templates with no transfers generated | Transfer templates where `is_active = True` but no `budget.transfers` rows reference them |
| OR-06 | Savings goals for inactive accounts | Goals where `is_active = True` but the referenced account has `is_active = False` |

### Category 3: Balance Anomalies

Checks that flag potential issues in the anchor balance and projection system.

| Check ID | Description | SQL Logic |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| BA-01 | Anchor balance set but no anchor period | Accounts where `current_anchor_balance IS NOT NULL` but `current_anchor_period_id IS NULL` (or vice versa) |
| BA-02 | Anchor period is beyond the last pay period | Accounts where `current_anchor_period_id` points to a period with a `period_index` higher than the maximum for that user |
| BA-03 | Pay period sequence gaps | Users where the `period_index` values in `budget.pay_periods` are not contiguous (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 4 -- missing 3) |
| BA-04 | Pay period date overlap | Pay periods for the same user where date ranges overlap (`start_date` of one falls between `start_date` and `end_date` of another) |
| BA-05 | Large anchor balance jumps | Consecutive entries in `budget.account_anchor_history` for the same account where the balance changes by more than 50% (configurable threshold) |

### Category 4: Data Consistency

Cross-table logical consistency checks.

| Check ID | Description | SQL Logic |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| DC-01 | Transactions with status "done" or "received" but no actual_amount | Status indicates completion but `actual_amount IS NULL` |
| DC-02 | Transfer from_account equals to_account | Should be prevented by check constraint, but verify no violations exist |
| DC-03 | Account type-specific params mismatch | Accounts with `account_type.category = 'liability'` but no `mortgage_params` or `auto_loan_params`; accounts with `account_type.name = 'hysa'` but no `hysa_params` |
| DC-04 | Self-referential credit payback cycles | Transactions where `credit_payback_for_id` forms a chain longer than 1 (A pays back B pays back C) |
| DC-05 | Active templates for inactive accounts | Transaction templates where `is_active = True` but the referenced account has `is_active = False` |
| DC-06 | Duplicate non-deleted transactions per template/period/scenario | Should be prevented by partial unique index, but verify no violations (especially after a restore) |
| DC-07 | Users without user_settings | Every user in `auth.users` should have exactly one row in `auth.user_settings` |
| DC-08 | Users without a baseline scenario | Every user should have exactly one scenario with `is_baseline = True` |
| DC-09 | Salary deduction target accounts belong to same user | `paycheck_deductions.target_account_id` references an account owned by a different user than the salary profile owner |

### Summary

| Category | Check Count | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Referential Integrity | 13 | Critical |
| Orphan Detection | 6 | Warning |
| Balance Anomalies | 5 | Warning |
| Data Consistency | 9 | Mixed (Critical: DC-01, DC-06, DC-07, DC-08; Warning: others) |
| **Total** | **33** | |

## Work Units

The implementation is organized into 5 work units. Each unit leaves the project in a working state. Dependencies between units are noted.

### Dependency Graph

```
WU-1: Backup Script (backup.sh)
  |
  v
WU-2: Retention Script (backup_retention.sh)
  |
  v
WU-3: Restore Script (restore.sh)
  |
  v
WU-4: Integrity Check Script (integrity_check.py)
  |
  v
WU-5: Verify Script (verify_backup.sh) + Runbook
```

WU-1 and WU-2 are tightly coupled (retention requires backups to exist). WU-3 is independent of WU-2 but depends on WU-1 (needs a backup file to restore). WU-4 is independent of WU-1 through WU-3 but is listed after WU-3 for logical ordering. WU-5 ties everything together and depends on WU-1, WU-3, and WU-4.

### WU-1: Backup Script

**Goal:** Create `scripts/backup.sh` that produces a compressed PostgreSQL dump with timestamped filename, copies to local and NAS destinations, and exits with appropriate status codes.

**Depends on:** None.

1. `pg_dump` runs inside the `shekel-db` container via `docker exec` to ensure PostgreSQL client/server version compatibility.
2. The `--schema` flags explicitly list all 6 schemas (`public`, `ref`, `auth`, `budget`, `salary`, `system`) to capture the `alembic_version` table in `public` and exclude PostgreSQL internal schemas.
3. `--clean --if-exists` produces a dump that can be restored to an existing database by dropping and recreating objects.
4. `--no-owner --no-privileges` makes the dump portable across environments where the PostgreSQL user may differ.
5. NAS failure is non-fatal: the script logs a warning but exits 0 if the local backup succeeded. This satisfies Risk R7 from the master plan.
6. Encryption is opt-in via `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE`. When set, the `.sql.gz` is encrypted to `.sql.gz.gpg` and the unencrypted file is removed.

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `scripts/backup.sh --help` prints usage and exits 0
- [ ] `scripts/backup.sh --no-nas --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup` creates a `.sql.gz` file in the specified directory
- [ ] The backup file contains SQL statements for all 5 schemas + public
- [ ] `zcat <backup_file> | head -50` shows `pg_dump` header and schema creation statements
- [ ] Script exits non-zero if the database container is not running
- [ ] Script exits 0 with a WARNING log if NAS directory is unreachable

#### Manual Verification

1. **Happy path:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   ./scripts/backup.sh --no-nas --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   # Verify: file exists, is non-empty, contains valid SQL
   ls -lh /tmp/shekel_test_backup/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz
   zcat /tmp/shekel_test_backup/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz | head -20
   ```

2. **Encryption:**
   ```bash
   BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE="test123" ./scripts/backup.sh --no-nas --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   # Verify: .sql.gz.gpg file exists, .sql.gz does not
   ls /tmp/shekel_test_backup/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz.gpg
   # Decrypt and verify:
   echo "test123" | gpg --batch --passphrase-fd 0 -d /tmp/shekel_test_backup/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz.gpg | zcat | head -20
   ```

3. **NAS failure:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/backup.sh --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup --nas-dir /nonexistent/path
   # Verify: exit code is 0, log contains WARNING about NAS
   echo $?
   ```

4. **Database container not running:**
   ```bash
   docker stop shekel-db
   ./scripts/backup.sh --no-nas --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   # Verify: exit code is non-zero, log contains ERROR
   echo $?
   docker start shekel-db
   ```

### WU-2: Retention Script

**Goal:** Create `scripts/backup_retention.sh` that prunes old backup files according to tiered retention policy (daily: 7 days, weekly/Sunday: 4 weeks, monthly/1st: 6 months). Applies independently to local and NAS directories.

**Depends on:** WU-1 (backup files must exist to be pruned; also establishes the filename convention `shekel_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz[.gpg]`).

**Key design decisions:**

1. Retention tiers are evaluated in order: monthly > weekly > daily. A file that qualifies for a higher tier is always kept.
2. The date is extracted from the **filename** (`shekel_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`), not the file modification time, as specified in the constraints.
3. "Sunday" is determined using GNU `date`'s day-of-week calculation. "1st of month" is a simple string check on the DD portion.
4. Local and NAS directories are pruned independently -- a file can be pruned from local but retained on NAS if the NAS has a different set of files.
5. `--dry-run` mode logs what would be deleted without deleting.
6. Both `.sql.gz` and `.sql.gz.gpg` files are handled by the glob `shekel_backup_*.sql.gz*`.

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `scripts/backup_retention.sh --help` prints usage and exits 0
- [ ] `--dry-run` logs files that would be deleted without removing them
- [ ] Daily backups older than 7 days are deleted (unless they qualify for weekly or monthly tiers)
- [ ] Sunday backups older than 4 weeks but younger than 6 months are deleted
- [ ] 1st-of-month backups older than 6 months are deleted
- [ ] A backup from 3 days ago is retained (daily tier)
- [ ] A backup from Sunday 2 weeks ago is retained (weekly tier)
- [ ] A backup from the 1st of last month is retained (monthly tier)
- [ ] Missing NAS directory produces a WARNING but does not fail the script

#### Manual Verification

Create test backup files with various dates and verify the retention logic:

```bash
# Setup: create a test directory with fake backup files.
TEST_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
mkdir -p "${TEST_DIR}/local"

# Create files with various dates (modify the timestamp in the filename).
# Today: should be kept (daily).
touch "${TEST_DIR}/local/shekel_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)_020000.sql.gz"

# 3 days ago: should be kept (daily).
touch "${TEST_DIR}/local/shekel_backup_$(date -d '-3 days' +%Y%m%d)_020000.sql.gz"

# 10 days ago, not Sunday, not 1st: should be deleted.
touch "${TEST_DIR}/local/shekel_backup_$(date -d '-10 days' +%Y%m%d)_020000.sql.gz"

# Find the most recent Sunday within 3 weeks: should be kept (weekly).
RECENT_SUNDAY=$(date -d "last Sunday - 14 days" +%Y%m%d)
touch "${TEST_DIR}/local/shekel_backup_${RECENT_SUNDAY}_020000.sql.gz"

# 1st of two months ago: should be kept (monthly).
FIRST_OF_MONTH=$(date -d "2 months ago" +%Y%m)01
touch "${TEST_DIR}/local/shekel_backup_${FIRST_OF_MONTH}_020000.sql.gz"

# 1st of eight months ago: should be deleted (older than 6 months).
OLD_FIRST=$(date -d "8 months ago" +%Y%m)01
touch "${TEST_DIR}/local/shekel_backup_${OLD_FIRST}_020000.sql.gz"

# Dry run to verify.
./scripts/backup_retention.sh --local-dir "${TEST_DIR}/local" --nas-dir /nonexistent --dry-run

# Actual run.
./scripts/backup_retention.sh --local-dir "${TEST_DIR}/local" --nas-dir /nonexistent

# Verify remaining files.
ls "${TEST_DIR}/local/"

# Cleanup.

**Key design decisions:**

1. **Interactive confirmation defaults to No** (`[y/N]`). Pressing Enter without typing "y" cancels the restore. The `--skip-confirm` flag is available for scripted use (e.g., from `verify_backup.sh`).
2. The restore sequence is: stop app → terminate connections → drop database → create database → create schemas → restore from dump → start app (which runs entrypoint including `init_database.py` for migrations).
3. The entrypoint handles Alembic migrations automatically on startup (`scripts/init_database.py`), so after restoring an older backup, the app's normal startup sequence applies any pending migrations.
4. `--single-transaction` flag on `psql` ensures the restore is atomic -- if any statement fails, the entire restore is rolled back.
5. Encrypted backups (`.gpg` extension) are automatically detected and decrypted using `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE`.
6. A basic post-restore verification checks for users and pay periods to confirm the restore produced a non-empty database.

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `scripts/restore.sh --help` prints usage and exits 0
- [ ] Pressing Enter at the confirmation prompt cancels the restore
- [ ] Typing "y" at the confirmation proceeds with the restore
- [ ] `--skip-confirm` bypasses the prompt
- [ ] Specifying a nonexistent file exits with an error
- [ ] After restore, the database contains the expected data
- [ ] After restore, the application starts and is accessible

#### Manual Verification

1. **Happy path (full cycle):**
   ```bash
   # Create a backup first.
   mkdir -p /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   ./scripts/backup.sh --no-nas --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t /tmp/shekel_test_backup/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz | head -1)

   # Restore from the backup.
   ./scripts/restore.sh "${BACKUP_FILE}"
   # Type "y" at the prompt.

   # Verify: application is accessible.

### WU-4: Integrity Check Script

**Goal:** Create `scripts/integrity_check.py` that validates referential integrity, detects orphaned records, flags balance anomalies, and checks data consistency across all database schemas. Runnable both standalone (CLI) and importable (for `verify_backup.sh` and pytest).

**Depends on:** None (independent of shell scripts; uses the existing SQLAlchemy/Flask stack).

#### Files to Create

**`scripts/integrity_check.py`** -- Python script for database integrity validation.

```python
"""
Shekel Budget App -- Data Integrity Check

Validates referential integrity, detects orphaned records, flags balance
anomalies, and checks data consistency across all database schemas.

Designed to be:
    - Run standalone via CLI: python scripts/integrity_check.py
    - Called from verify_backup.sh against a temporary database
    - Tested by pytest against the test database

Usage:
    python scripts/integrity_check.py [--database-url URL] [--verbose] [--category CAT]

Options:
    --database-url URL   Override the database URL (for verify_backup.sh)
    --verbose            Print details for each check, not just failures
    --category CAT       Run only checks in this category
                         (referential, orphan, balance, consistency)

Exit codes:
    0   All checks passed
    1   One or more CRITICAL checks failed
    2   One or more WARNING checks flagged issues (no critical failures)
    3   Script error (bad arguments, database connection failure)

Cron example (weekly, after backup verification):
    0 3 * * 0 docker exec shekel-app python scripts/integrity_check.py

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `python scripts/integrity_check.py --help` prints usage and exits 0
- [ ] `pytest tests/test_scripts/test_integrity_check.py -v` passes all tests
- [ ] All 33 checks pass on a properly seeded development database
- [ ] Script exits 1 when a critical check fails
- [ ] Script exits 2 when only warning checks fail
- [ ] `--category referential` runs only FK checks
- [ ] `--database-url` override connects to a different database

#### Impact on Existing Tests

No existing tests are affected. The integrity check script is entirely new and does not modify any application code, models, or routes. The test file `tests/test_scripts/test_integrity_check.py` uses the same fixtures (`app`, `db`, `seed_user`, `seed_periods`) as existing script tests.

Some tests intentionally create invalid data (e.g., orphaned records) by using raw SQL to bypass SQLAlchemy FK constraints. These tests operate within a single test transaction and are cleaned up by the `db` fixture's truncation between tests.

### WU-5: Verify Script and Runbook

**Goal:** Create `scripts/verify_backup.sh` that restores a backup to a temporary database, runs integrity checks and sanity queries, and cleans up. Create the `docs/backup_runbook.md` documentation covering all backup, restore, retention, and verification procedures.

**Depends on:** WU-1 (backup files), WU-3 (restore logic reused conceptually), WU-4 (integrity check script called during verification).

#### Files to Create

**`scripts/verify_backup.sh`** -- Bash script for backup verification against a temporary database.

}

usage() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: $(basename "$0") <backup_file>

Verify a Shekel backup by restoring to a temporary database and running
sanity checks.

This will:
    1. Create a temporary database (${VERIFY_DB})
    2. Restore the backup into it
    3. Run sanity check queries (row counts, user check, date ranges)
    4. Run the integrity check script
    5. Drop the temporary database

The production database is never touched.

Arguments:
    backup_file     Path to a .sql.gz or .sql.gz.gpg backup file

**Key design decisions:**

1. A `trap cleanup EXIT` handler ensures the temporary database is dropped even if the script fails partway through.
2. The temporary database name (`shekel_verify`) is configurable via `VERIFY_DB` to avoid collisions.
3. Sanity checks (row counts, user existence, date ranges) are shell-level `psql` queries -- fast and independent of the Python stack.
4. The integrity check script runs inside the app container with an overridden `DATABASE_URL` pointing at the verify database.
5. The production database is never touched during verification.

**`docs/backup_runbook.md`** -- Comprehensive documentation for all backup and disaster recovery procedures.

Section outline:

```markdown
# Shekel Backup & Disaster Recovery Runbook

## 1. Overview
    - Purpose and scope
    - Backup strategy summary (daily automated, tiered retention, NAS copy)
    - Script inventory and locations

## 2. Prerequisites
    - Host: Arch Linux with Docker and Docker Compose
    - PostgreSQL container running as shekel-db
    - NAS mount configured (if using off-site backups)
    - Environment variables configured in .env or host shell

## 3. Automated Backup Setup
    ### 3.1 Cron Configuration
        - Daily backup crontab entry (2:00 AM):
          0 2 * * * /path/to/shekel/scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/shekel_backup.log 2>&1
        - Daily retention cleanup (2:30 AM):
          30 2 * * * /path/to/shekel/scripts/backup_retention.sh >> /var/log/shekel_backup.log 2>&1
        - Weekly verification (Sunday 3:00 AM):
          0 3 * * 0 /path/to/shekel/scripts/verify_backup.sh $(ls -t /var/backups/shekel/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz* | head -1) >> /var/log/shekel_backup.log 2>&1
        - Weekly integrity check (Sunday 3:30 AM):
          30 3 * * 0 docker exec shekel-app python scripts/integrity_check.py >> /var/log/shekel_backup.log 2>&1

    ### 3.2 NAS Mount Configuration
        #### NFS Option
            - Install nfs-utils: pacman -S nfs-utils
            - Create mount point: mkdir -p /mnt/nas/backups/shekel
            - Add fstab entry (documented with example)
            - Mount and verify: mount -a && touch /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/.test && rm /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/.test
        #### CIFS/SMB Option
            - Install cifs-utils: pacman -S cifs-utils
            - Create credentials file: /root/.nas-credentials
            - Add fstab entry (documented with example)
            - Mount and verify

    ### 3.3 Encryption Setup (Optional)
        - Generate a strong passphrase
        - Set BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE in environment
        - Store passphrase separately from backups (e.g., password manager)
        - WARNING: lost passphrase = unrecoverable backups

## 4. Manual Backup
    - Command: ./scripts/backup.sh [--local-dir DIR] [--nas-dir DIR] [--no-nas]
    - Verify output file exists and is non-empty

## 5. Retention Policy
    - Policy summary table (daily/weekly/monthly tiers)
    - Command: ./scripts/backup_retention.sh [--dry-run]
    - How to adjust retention periods via environment variables

## 6. Restore Procedure
    ### 6.1 Identify the Backup to Restore
        - List available backups: ls -lht /var/backups/shekel/
        - For NAS backups: ls -lht /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/
        - To restore to a specific date: find the backup with the matching YYYYMMDD

    ### 6.2 Run the Restore
        - Command: ./scripts/restore.sh /path/to/backup.sql.gz
        - The script will prompt for confirmation (type "y" to proceed)
        - For encrypted backups: set BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE first

    ### 6.3 Verify the Restore
        - Check the application at http://localhost:5000
        - Verify data: login and check the budget grid
        - Run integrity checks: docker exec shekel-app python scripts/integrity_check.py

    ### 6.4 Restoring from NAS
        - If local backups are unavailable, copy from NAS first:
          cp /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/shekel_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz /tmp/
          ./scripts/restore.sh /tmp/shekel_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz

## 7. Backup Verification
    - Command: ./scripts/verify_backup.sh /path/to/backup.sql.gz
    - What it checks (sanity queries + integrity checks)
    - Expected output (PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL)
    - Recommended schedule: weekly (Sunday 3:00 AM)

## 8. Integrity Checks
    - Command: docker exec shekel-app python scripts/integrity_check.py [--verbose]
    - Check categories and severity levels
    - How to interpret results
    - What to do when a check fails

## 9. Troubleshooting
    ### Common Issues
        - "Database container is not running" → docker start shekel-db
        - "NAS directory does not exist" → verify mount: mount | grep nas
        - "Backup file is empty" → check disk space, PostgreSQL logs
        - "Encrypted backup but no passphrase" → set BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE
        - "Restore failed: permission denied" → verify PGUSER has CREATEDB privilege
        - "Integrity check CRITICAL failures after restore" → may indicate corrupt backup; try an older backup

    ### Log Files
        - Backup script logs: /var/log/shekel_backup.log (if cron redirects stdout)
        - Application structured logs: docker logs shekel-app
        - PostgreSQL logs: docker logs shekel-db

## 10. Environment Variables Reference
    | Variable | Default | Used By | Description |
    |----------|---------|---------|-------------|
    | BACKUP_LOCAL_DIR | /var/backups/shekel | backup.sh, retention.sh | Local backup storage |
    | BACKUP_NAS_DIR | /mnt/nas/backups/shekel | backup.sh, retention.sh | NAS backup storage |
    | BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE | (none) | backup.sh, restore.sh, verify.sh | GPG encryption passphrase |
    | DB_CONTAINER | shekel-db | all scripts | PostgreSQL Docker container |
    | APP_CONTAINER | shekel-app | restore.sh, verify.sh | App Docker container |
    | PGUSER | shekel_user | all scripts | PostgreSQL user |
    | PGDATABASE | shekel | all scripts | PostgreSQL database name |
    | RETENTION_DAILY_DAYS | 7 | retention.sh | Days to keep daily backups |
    | RETENTION_WEEKLY_WEEKS | 4 | retention.sh | Weeks to keep Sunday backups |
    | RETENTION_MONTHLY_MONTHS | 6 | retention.sh | Months to keep 1st-of-month backups |
```

#### Files to Modify

**`.env.example`** -- Add backup-related environment variables.

Current (lines 39-42):
```
# ── Gunicorn (Docker production only) ────────────────────────────
GUNICORN_WORKERS=2
APP_PORT=5000
```

Add after line 42:

```
# ── Backups ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Local directory for backup files (host path, not inside container).
BACKUP_LOCAL_DIR=/var/backups/shekel
# NAS mount point for off-site backup copies.
BACKUP_NAS_DIR=/mnt/nas/backups/shekel
# GPG passphrase for encrypting backups at rest (optional).
# If empty, backups are stored unencrypted.
# WARNING: Store this passphrase separately from the backups themselves.
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE=
# Retention periods for backup pruning.
RETENTION_DAILY_DAYS=7
RETENTION_WEEKLY_WEEKS=4
RETENTION_MONTHLY_MONTHS=6
```

#### Test Gate

- [ ] `scripts/verify_backup.sh --help` prints usage and exits 0
- [ ] Verification creates a temporary database, runs checks, and drops the database
- [ ] Temporary database is cleaned up even if a check fails (trap handler)
- [ ] Sanity checks detect empty tables (user count, period count, account count)
- [ ] Integrity checks run against the temporary database, not production
- [ ] `docs/backup_runbook.md` covers all procedures (backup, restore, retention, verify, integrity)
- [ ] `.env.example` includes all backup-related environment variables

#### Manual Verification

1. **Happy path:**
   ```bash
   # Create a backup.
   mkdir -p /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   ./scripts/backup.sh --no-nas --local-dir /tmp/shekel_test_backup
   BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t /tmp/shekel_test_backup/shekel_backup_*.sql.gz | head -1)

   # Verify the backup.
   ./scripts/verify_backup.sh "${BACKUP_FILE}"
   # Expected: all sanity checks PASS, integrity checks PASS, final status PASS.

   # Verify the temp database was cleaned up.
   docker exec shekel-db psql -U shekel_user -d postgres -c "\l" | grep shekel_verify
   # Expected: no output (database was dropped).
   ```

2. **Corrupt backup file:**
   ```bash
   echo "corrupt data" | gzip > /tmp/corrupt_backup.sql.gz
   ./scripts/verify_backup.sh /tmp/corrupt_backup.sql.gz
   # Expected: restore fails, status FAIL, temp database still cleaned up.
   ```

3. **Trap cleanup on failure:**
   ```bash
   # Manually create the verify database to simulate a previous failed run.
   docker exec shekel-db psql -U shekel_user -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE shekel_verify OWNER shekel_user;"
   # Run verify -- it should drop and recreate.
   ./scripts/verify_backup.sh "${BACKUP_FILE}"
   # Verify cleanup.
   docker exec shekel-db psql -U shekel_user -d postgres -c "\l" | grep shekel_verify
   ```

# Secret Management -- Operations Runbook

## Secret Inventory

The Shekel application requires four required secrets for production
operation, plus one optional secret used only during a key rotation.
All other environment variables have safe defaults or are
non-sensitive.

| Secret | Purpose | Generation Command | Rotation Impact |
|--------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask session cookie encryption | `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"` | All active sessions are invalidated; users must log in again |
| `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Fernet encryption of TOTP secrets stored in database | `python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"` | Non-destructive when rotated via the documented procedure: place the previous value in `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD`, then run `scripts/rotate_totp_key.py --confirm` to re-wrap every ciphertext under the new primary |
| `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD` | Optional comma-separated list of retired Fernet keys used during rotation | -- (existing primary value, moved here at rotation time) | Empty in steady state.  Populated transiently during a key rotation; pruned again after `scripts/rotate_totp_key.py` completes |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL superuser password (owner role `shekel_user`).  Used by `entrypoint.sh` for schema creation, migrations, seed scripts | `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"` | Requires updating both the db service and app service configs simultaneously; restart both containers |
| `APP_ROLE_PASSWORD` | Least-privilege PostgreSQL DML-only role password (`shekel_app`).  Constructed into `DATABASE_URL_APP` by `entrypoint.sh` and used by Gunicorn at runtime so an in-process RCE cannot drop tables or audit triggers (audit finding F-081, Commit C-13) | `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"` | `entrypoint.sh` reprovisions the `shekel_app` role with the new password on every restart; rotate by updating the source-of-truth secret and recreating the app container |

## Where Secrets Are Stored

The Shekel deployment supports two postures for secret storage.  Both
are operator-grade and either is acceptable for production; the
file-backed posture is recommended for the shared-mode
(`deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`) deployment.

### Posture 1 -- Env-backed (`.env` file)

The default posture, used by the bundled-mode quickstart.  Secrets
live in the `.env` file on the host, in the same directory as the
`docker-compose.yml` file (`/opt/docker/shekel/.env` for shared mode,
`/opt/shekel/.env` for bundled mode).

- The `.env` file is excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).
- The `.env` file should be readable only by root: `chmod 600 .env`.
- Docker Compose reads `.env` automatically and injects values into
  container environment variables (`Container.Config.Env`).
- Trade-off: anyone with `docker inspect` access on the host sees the
  real values; the file at rest carries the real values too.

### Posture 2 -- File-backed (Docker secrets, audit Commit C-38)

Available in shared-mode production (`deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`).
Secrets live in individual files under `/opt/docker/shekel/secrets/`,
bind-mounted into the container as `/run/secrets/<name>`.  The
`.env` file holds non-sensitive variables and a placeholder for each
docker-secret-managed value (any non-empty string -- the placeholder
satisfies the base file's `${VAR:?...}` interpolation but is
overwritten at runtime by `entrypoint.sh::_load_secret`).

- Files are stored in `/opt/docker/shekel/secrets/`.
- Recommended permissions: directory `0700` root-owned, files `0600`
  root-owned.
- Per-file secrets: `secret_key`, `postgres_password`,
  `app_role_password`, `totp_encryption_key` (and
  `totp_encryption_key_old` only during a TOTP key rotation -- see
  the "Rotating TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY" section below).
- Trade-off: `docker inspect` shows only the placeholder values; the
  real values live only in the operator-controlled secrets directory.

### Migrating to Docker secrets

One-time procedure to move from Posture 1 to Posture 2 on an
existing shared-mode deployment.  Plan a maintenance window: the
final step recreates both the `app` and `db` containers.

1. Confirm you are running shared-mode production (the override
   `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` is active):

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   # Expect: shekel-prod-app, shekel-prod-db, shekel-prod-redis
   ```

   If the bundled `shekel-prod-nginx` is also present, you are in
   bundled mode -- docker secrets are not wired in for that path,
   continue with Posture 1.

2. Create the secrets directory with restrictive permissions.  Run
   on the Proxmox host:

   ```bash
   sudo install -d -m 0700 -o root -g root /opt/docker/shekel/secrets
   ```

3. Write the four required secret values from `.env` into individual
   files.  `printf '%s'` (no trailing newline) is preferred over
   `echo` so the file contents are exactly the secret bytes; the
   entrypoint loader strips a trailing newline if `echo` was used by
   mistake but `printf` is the documented form:

   ```bash
   # Read each value out of the existing .env into a host shell
   # variable, then write it through to the secrets directory.  The
   # awk extracts the value (everything after the first =) so embedded
   # = signs in the value (rare but legal in random hex/base64) are
   # preserved.
   for var in SECRET_KEY POSTGRES_PASSWORD APP_ROLE_PASSWORD TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY; do
       value="$(awk -F= -v k="${var}" '$1==k { sub(/^[^=]*=/, ""); print; exit }' /opt/docker/shekel/.env)"
       file_name="$(echo "${var}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
       sudo printf '%s' "${value}" | sudo tee /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/${file_name} >/dev/null
   done
   sudo chmod 0600 /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/*
   ```

   Verify each file has the right content:

   ```bash
   sudo wc -c /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/*
   # Expect: each file's byte count matches the original env var's length.
   ```

4. Replace the real values in `/opt/docker/shekel/.env` with
   placeholder strings.  Any non-empty string satisfies the base
   file's `${VAR:?...}` interpolation; `replaced_by_docker_secret`
   is the documented form because a forensic reader sees the intent
   immediately:

   ```diff
   -SECRET_KEY=<the-real-secret-key>
   -POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<the-real-postgres-password>
   -APP_ROLE_PASSWORD=<the-real-app-role-password>
   -TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<the-real-totp-encryption-key>
   +SECRET_KEY=replaced_by_docker_secret
   +POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replaced_by_docker_secret
   +APP_ROLE_PASSWORD=replaced_by_docker_secret
   +TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=replaced_by_docker_secret
   ```

   `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD` stays as-is (empty in steady state).

5. Recreate the `db` and `app` containers so the new compose merge
   takes effect:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/docker/shekel
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate db app
   ```

6. Verify the migration succeeded:

   ```bash
   # The app's runtime env should show the REAL SECRET_KEY (loaded
   # from /run/secrets/secret_key by entrypoint.sh::_load_secret).
   # We do not print the value -- only its length -- so the secret
   # never lands in shell history or terminal scrollback.
   docker exec shekel-prod-app sh -c 'echo SECRET_KEY length=${#SECRET_KEY}'
   # Expect: SECRET_KEY length=64 (or whatever the real key length is).

   # docker inspect should show the placeholder, not the real value.
   docker inspect shekel-prod-app --format '{{ range .Config.Env }}{{ println . }}{{ end }}' | grep -E '^SECRET_KEY='
   # Expect: SECRET_KEY=replaced_by_docker_secret

   # entrypoint.sh log lines confirm the file-backed load.
   docker logs shekel-prod-app 2>&1 | grep '^Loaded '
   # Expect:
   #   Loaded SECRET_KEY from /run/secrets/secret_key.
   #   Loaded POSTGRES_PASSWORD from /run/secrets/postgres_password.
   #   Loaded APP_ROLE_PASSWORD from /run/secrets/app_role_password.
   #   Loaded TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY from /run/secrets/totp_encryption_key.
   ```

7. Backup the secrets directory.  The host-side files are now the
   only source of truth for these values; losing them means a full
   secret rotation.  Add to the backup cron job:

   ```bash
   tar -czf /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/secrets-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
       -C /opt/docker/shekel secrets
   ```

   Encrypt the backup tarball at rest (gpg, age, or sops) -- the
   tarball is the equivalent of a master credential bundle.

### Rolling back to Posture 1

If file-backed secrets cause an issue and you need to revert:

1. Replace each placeholder in `.env` with its real value (recover
   from the host secrets directory or from your password-manager
   backup):

   ```bash
   for var in SECRET_KEY POSTGRES_PASSWORD APP_ROLE_PASSWORD TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY; do
       file_name="$(echo "${var}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
       value="$(sudo cat /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/${file_name})"
       sudo sed -i "s|^${var}=.*|${var}=${value}|" /opt/docker/shekel/.env
   done
   ```

2. Move the secrets directory aside (do NOT delete -- losing the
   files is irreversible without the password-manager backup):

   ```bash
   sudo mv /opt/docker/shekel/secrets /opt/docker/shekel/secrets.disabled
   ```

3. Recreate the affected containers:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/docker/shekel
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate db app
   ```

   `docker compose up` will fail at parse time if any secret
   referenced in `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` is missing its
   backing file -- that is the trade-off for explicitness.  If you
   want to disable file-backed secrets entirely (rather than just
   roll them back temporarily), check out a previous git revision
   of `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` from before Commit C-38.

## Secret Rotation Procedures

### Rotating SECRET_KEY

1. Generate a new key: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
   The output is a 64-character hex string (256 bits of entropy).  The
   production config rejects any value shorter than 32 characters or
   matching a known placeholder.
2. Install the new value at the source of truth for your posture:

   - **Posture 1 (env-backed):** update `SECRET_KEY` in `.env`.
   - **Posture 2 (file-backed):** overwrite the secret file with
     `printf` (no trailing newline) so the file content is exactly
     the secret bytes:

     ```bash
     sudo printf '%s' '<new-secret-key>' | \
         sudo tee /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/secret_key >/dev/null
     sudo chmod 0600 /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/secret_key
     ```

     Leave the placeholder in `.env` unchanged.

3. Restart the app container: `docker compose restart app`.  The
   entrypoint reloads the secret on every start, so the rotation
   is in effect after the restart.
4. Run the global session-invalidation script (see next section) so
   that any cookies signed under the old key are rejected even if an
   attacker captured them before the key was rotated.
5. Impact: all active sessions are invalidated; users must
   re-authenticate.

### Post-rotation session invalidation

Rotating `SECRET_KEY` makes every previously-issued session cookie
unverifiable on the new key.  However, any cookie an attacker captured
before the rotation can still be reused by anyone who learns the
*old* key (for example, anyone with read access to git history that
contains a previously-leaked key).  The defense-in-depth control is
to bump `users.session_invalidated_at` for every row, which causes
the `load_user` callback in `app/__init__.py` to reject any session
older than the bump time -- regardless of which key it was signed
with.

Run after every `SECRET_KEY` rotation, and after any git history
rewrite that excises a historically-leaked key:

```bash
docker exec shekel-prod-app python scripts/rotate_sessions.py --confirm
```

The script bumps `session_invalidated_at` to `now()` for every row
in `auth.users`.  It is idempotent (repeated runs simply move the
timestamp forward) and emits a structured log event
`sessions_invalidated_global` at WARNING level so the audit log
captures the operation.

The `--confirm` flag is mandatory; running without it prints a usage
hint and exits with code 1.

#### Rewriting git history to remove a leaked SECRET_KEY

If a `SECRET_KEY` value was committed to git history (for example,
audit finding F-001), rotating the live key is necessary but not
sufficient: anyone with access to the repository's object store can
still extract the historical key from the dangling blob.  The full
remediation is:

1. **Inventory clones.**  Track every clone of the repository
   (developer machines, CI caches, audit-branch snapshots, NAS
   backups).  Each will need to be re-cloned after the rewrite.

2. **Rotate the live key first.**  Follow the `Rotating SECRET_KEY`
   procedure above.  This minimises the window during which an
   attacker can use a historical key against current sessions.

3. **Rewrite history.**  Use either tool below.  Both must run
   against a fresh, clean local clone -- not your working copy:

   - `git filter-repo`:
     ```bash
     git clone --mirror <remote-url> shekel.git
     cd shekel.git
     # Replace the literal leaked value with a placeholder marker:
     printf 'OLD_LEAKED_KEY_HERE==>REDACTED\n' > replacements.txt
     git filter-repo --replace-text replacements.txt
     ```
   - BFG Repo-Cleaner:
     ```bash
     git clone --mirror <remote-url> shekel.git
     cd shekel.git
     bfg --replace-text replacements.txt
     git reflog expire --expire=now --all
     git gc --prune=now --aggressive
     ```

4. **Force-push the rewritten history** to the affected branches.
   Coordinate with any other contributors first.  The Shekel
   repository is single-owner, so coordination is trivial.

5. **Run the session-invalidation script** described above so that
   any cookies signed under the historical key are invalidated even
   if an attacker preserved them.

6. **Re-clone everywhere.**  Every existing clone (developer machine,
   CI runner cache, audit-branch snapshot) still has the leaked key
   in its object store.  Delete each clone and re-clone from the
   rewritten remote.  Document this in the audit trail.

7. **Install a pre-commit hook** (gitleaks or detect-secrets) so the
   pattern cannot recur.  This is tracked separately in the audit
   remediation plan.

### Rotating TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY

This procedure is **non-destructive**: existing MFA enrollments
remain valid throughout the rotation, and users do not need to
re-enroll.  It relies on the application's `MultiFernet`
configuration, which accepts the new primary key for encryption AND
decrypts ciphertexts written under any retired key listed in
`TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD`.

The full rotation has four steps and one optional cleanup deploy:

1. **Generate the new primary key.**
   ```bash
   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
   ```
   Save the output -- it is the only chance to capture it.

2. **Promote the existing primary to retired, install the new
   primary.**

   - **Posture 1 (env-backed):** in `/opt/shekel/.env`:
     ```diff
     -TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<previous-primary-value>
     +TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<newly-generated-value>
     +TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD=<previous-primary-value>
     ```

   - **Posture 2 (file-backed):**
     ```bash
     # Move the current primary into the retired-key file.
     sudo mv /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key \
             /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key_old
     # Install the new primary.
     sudo printf '%s' '<newly-generated-value>' | \
         sudo tee /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key >/dev/null
     sudo chmod 0600 /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key \
                     /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key_old
     ```
     The `totp_encryption_key_old` file is NOT declared in the
     `secrets:` block of `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` (because
     compose requires every declared secret file to exist).  Inline-
     edit the override to add it before bringing the stack back up:
     ```diff
        services:
          app:
            secrets:
              - secret_key
              - postgres_password
              - app_role_password
              - totp_encryption_key
     +        - totp_encryption_key_old
        ...
        secrets:
          ...
          totp_encryption_key:
            file: /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key
     +    totp_encryption_key_old:
     +      file: /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key_old
     ```
     Step 5 below removes the inline edit and the retired-key file
     after rotation.

   If `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD` already has a value (e.g. from an
   earlier in-progress rotation), append the new retired value with
   a comma -- the application reads the value as a comma-separated
   list of Fernet keys, regardless of whether it came from an env
   var or a secret file.  In the file-backed posture, write the
   comma-joined string into the file with `printf` (no trailing
   newline) so the file content is exactly the comma-separated list.

3. **Restart the application container so the new key list takes
   effect.**
   ```bash
   docker compose restart app
   ```
   At this point the application can:

     - decrypt every existing ciphertext (via the retired key listed
       in `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD`), and
     - encrypt every new ciphertext under the new primary.

   Existing MFA users continue to log in successfully.  This is the
   safe state to validate end-to-end before continuing.

4. **Re-wrap every existing ciphertext under the new primary.**
   ```bash
   docker exec shekel-prod-app python scripts/rotate_totp_key.py --confirm
   ```
   The script prints a summary like
   ```
   Rotated 3; already current 0; skipped 0.
   ```
   - `Rotated` -- rows successfully migrated to the new primary.
   - `already current` -- rows that were already under the new
     primary (idempotent re-runs are safe).
   - `skipped` -- rows that could not be decrypted under any
     configured key.  **A non-zero `skipped` count means the script
     exits with code 2.**  Do not proceed to step 5; instead inspect
     the application log for the row id(s) and reconcile manually
     (typically by resetting MFA for the affected user via
     `scripts/reset_mfa.py`).

5. **Prune `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD` at the next deploy** (optional
   but recommended).  Once `scripts/rotate_totp_key.py` reports zero
   skipped rows, the retired key is no longer needed.

   - **Posture 1 (env-backed):** clear the entry in `.env`:
     ```diff
     -TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD=<previous-primary-value>
     +TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD=
     ```
   - **Posture 2 (file-backed):** revert the inline edit to
     `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` from step 2 (remove the
     `totp_encryption_key_old` entries from the app's `secrets:`
     list and the top-level `secrets:` block) and delete the file:
     ```bash
     sudo rm /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/totp_encryption_key_old
     ```

   Run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate app`.  The retired
   key is now permanently retired -- if it was leaked, the leak no
   longer confers access to the MFA secrets.

   You may leave `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD` populated longer than
   necessary if you want a rollback window; the only cost is that
   the retired key continues to be a valid decryption key during
   that window.

#### Rollback

If something goes wrong before step 4 completes:

  - Restore the previous primary value to `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (and
    clear `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD` if you set it) and restart.  No
    ciphertexts have been mutated yet, so the application returns to
    its previous state.

If something goes wrong DURING step 4 (e.g. the script crashes
mid-run):

  - The script commits once at the end, so a crash leaves the table
    in its previous state.  Re-run the script after fixing the
    underlying issue.  Any rows it had not yet processed are still
    encrypted under the retired key; the next run picks up where it
    left off, and rows it had already migrated are detected as
    `already current` and skipped.

If something goes wrong after step 4 completes:

  - The retired key is still in `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY_OLD`, so the
    application can still decrypt under either key.  Decide whether
    to roll back to the previous primary (move the retired key back
    to `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and re-run the script in reverse -- in
    this case, the previously-current rows will be detected as
    "needing rotation" and re-wrapped under the old key) or accept
    the new primary as the steady state.

### Rotating POSTGRES_PASSWORD

1. Generate a new password.  No specific format is required, but a
   long random string is recommended:
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
   ```

2. Postgres validates the new password BEFORE the rotation can
   complete -- the old password must still be in effect when you
   issue the `ALTER ROLE` command.  Update both the running database
   and the source-of-truth secret in lockstep:

   ```bash
   # Run while the old password is still active.  Use ${OLD_PASSWORD}
   # from .env or the secret file -- the docker exec env passthrough
   # below avoids printing it to terminal scrollback.
   sudo PGPASSWORD="$(sudo cat /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/postgres_password)" \
       docker exec -e PGPASSWORD shekel-prod-db \
       psql -U shekel_user -d shekel \
       -c "ALTER ROLE shekel_user WITH PASSWORD '<new-password>';"
   ```

   (Posture 1 operators replace the `cat` above with the value from
   `.env` directly, e.g.  via `grep '^POSTGRES_PASSWORD=' .env`.)

3. Install the new value at the source of truth for your posture:

   - **Posture 1 (env-backed):** update `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
     `DATABASE_URL` and `DB_PASSWORD` reference
     `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` and are reconstructed by compose at the
     next `up`.
   - **Posture 2 (file-backed):** overwrite the secret file:
     ```bash
     sudo printf '%s' '<new-password>' | \
         sudo tee /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/postgres_password >/dev/null
     sudo chmod 0600 /opt/docker/shekel/secrets/postgres_password
     ```
     Leave the placeholder in `.env` unchanged.  The entrypoint
     reloads the secret on every start and rebuilds `DATABASE_URL`
     and `DB_PASSWORD` from the new value.

4. Recreate both containers so the new password takes effect:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/docker/shekel  # or wherever your compose files live
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate db app
   ```

5. Verify the app can connect under the new password:
   ```bash
   docker exec shekel-prod-app python -c "from app import create_app; create_app().app_context().push(); from app.extensions import db; db.session.execute(db.text('SELECT 1')); print('OK')"
   ```

## Disaster Recovery: Reconstructing Secrets

If the Proxmox host is lost and must be rebuilt from scratch:

1. **Restore the database** from NAS backups using `scripts/restore.sh`
   (see backup/restore runbook).

2. **Reconstruct the secrets store** for your posture:

   - **Posture 1 (env-backed):** rebuild `.env` using `.env.example`
     as a template:
     - `SECRET_KEY`: generate a new one.  Users will need to log in
       again.
     - `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: if you have the original key backed up
       (see recommendation below), use it.  If not, generate a new
       one and all users must re-enroll MFA.
     - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: use the password from the restored
       backup, or set a new one and update the PostgreSQL user
       password.
     - `APP_ROLE_PASSWORD`: any sufficiently random secret;
       `entrypoint.sh` reprovisions the `shekel_app` role with
       this password on every start.
     - All other variables have defaults or are non-sensitive.

   - **Posture 2 (file-backed):** restore
     `/opt/docker/shekel/secrets/` from your encrypted backup
     tarball.  If the backup is lost too, fall back to Posture 1
     above and follow the "Migrating to Docker secrets" procedure
     after the host is up.

3. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Recommendation: Back Up the secrets store

The shape of the backup depends on your posture:

```bash
# Posture 1 (env-backed) -- back up the .env file.  Add to the
# backup cron job (after the database backup):
cp /opt/docker/shekel/.env /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/env_backup

# Posture 2 (file-backed) -- back up the secrets directory.  Encrypt
# at rest because the tarball is the master credential bundle.
sudo tar -czf - -C /opt/docker/shekel secrets | \
    gpg --encrypt --recipient backup-key \
    > /mnt/nas/backups/shekel/secrets-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz.gpg
```

Either backup serves as the recovery source for step 2 above.

### Recommendation: Document Secrets in a Password Manager

Create a secure note in your password manager with:

- `SECRET_KEY` value
- `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` value
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` value
- `APP_ROLE_PASSWORD` value
- Date each secret was last rotated
- Posture in use (env-backed vs. file-backed)

This is the fastest disaster recovery path: copy values from the

I want add a page to my app to track income and expenses by paycheck. I want filters at the top of the page for account, start date and end date, and Starting Balance. I want the first table to be a summary table and have a column for each paycheck like 2/13, 2/27, 3/13 within the start and end date range. The summary table should have a row for Total Income, Total Expenses, Net, and End Balance, The End Balance should be calculated as the previous paychecks End Balance plus the Net. The first displayed paycheck should calculate the End Balance as Starting Balance plus Net.

I want to add a page to my app to track expenses by paycheck. I want an interactive table that has a column for each paycheck and a row for each expense. Each expense should be placed in the paycheck column based on the expense date so I can see which paycheck that expense will be paid from.

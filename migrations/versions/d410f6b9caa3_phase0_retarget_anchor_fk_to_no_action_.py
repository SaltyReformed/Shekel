"""phase0 retarget anchor fk to no action deferrable

Phase 0 of the pay-period CRUD work (see
``docs/plans/implementation_plan_pay_period_crud.md``).  Retargets the
``budget.accounts.current_anchor_period_id`` foreign key from
``ON DELETE SET NULL`` to ``ON DELETE NO ACTION DEFERRABLE INITIALLY
IMMEDIATE``.

Why this change:

  * The column is ``NOT NULL`` (every account must point at a live
    anchor period -- E-19 / Commit 3, migration ``cfb15e782f86``).  The
    inherited ``SET NULL`` action is therefore a latent landmine: if any
    future code path deletes a pay period that an account anchors to,
    PostgreSQL would try to NULL a ``NOT NULL`` column.  The pay-period
    CRUD work introduces exactly such delete paths (truncate /
    regenerate), so the action is tightened here, up front, as a
    standalone prerequisite.
  * ``NO ACTION`` (not ``RESTRICT``) is chosen deliberately.  Both refuse
    the delete of an anchored period -- with the application-level anchor
    lock in ``pay_period_admin`` (Phase 1) and this FK, an anchored
    period cannot be deleted through any path.  But ``RESTRICT`` is
    checked immediately and CANNOT be deferred, whereas ``NO ACTION`` can.
    The future full-reset path (``reset_pay_periods``, Phase 3) must
    delete the old anchor period and re-point each account to a fresh
    period inside ONE transaction; it does so via
    ``SET CONSTRAINTS ... DEFERRED`` so the FK validates at commit (by
    which point every account points at a live new period).  Declaring
    the FK ``DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`` keeps the fail-fast
    immediate check for every ordinary path while letting only that one
    reset transaction opt into deferral.  This migration ships now even
    though the reset path lands later: a ``DEFERRABLE INITIALLY
    IMMEDIATE`` FK behaves identically to a plain immediate ``NO ACTION``
    FK for every non-reset statement, so it is inert until Phase 3 uses
    it, and shipping it here avoids a second FK migration later.

The constraint keeps its existing Alembic-default name
``accounts_current_anchor_period_id_fkey`` (one of the ~35 default names
the C-43 sweep deliberately retained -- the model declares no explicit
``name=``, so create_all and this migration agree).  A drop-and-recreate
is used because ``ON DELETE`` and ``DEFERRABLE`` are part of the
constraint definition and PostgreSQL has no in-place ``ALTER`` for them;
both statements run inside the migration's single transaction, so the
window during which the FK is absent is invisible to concurrent
statements.  A post-recreate assertion reads ``pg_constraint`` back and
fails loudly if the new action/deferrability did not take -- the same
verification value the C-43 ``_assert_fk_ondelete`` helper provides,
inlined here for a single constraint (the C-43 idempotent drop/recreate
machinery is not reused: this FK is always present in the exact state the
chain leaves it, so there is no partial-apply/replay case to guard, and
the plain ``op`` idiom matches migration ``047bfed04987`` which owns this
FK).

Review: solo developer, 2026-06-13 (pay-period CRUD Phase 0).
Destructive (constraint drop-and-recreate per the destructive-migration
policy in ``docs/coding-standards.md``).  Downgrade is symmetric and
fully working: it restores ``ON DELETE SET NULL`` (not deferrable), the
exact pre-migration state installed by ``047bfed04987``.  No data is
read, written, or transformed in either direction.

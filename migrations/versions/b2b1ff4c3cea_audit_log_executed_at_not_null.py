"""align system.audit_log with canonical schema: executed_at NOT NULL + ck_audit_log_operation

Closes H-4 of docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/model-migration-drift.md.
Two storage-tier guarantees declared in
``app/audit_infrastructure.py:_CREATE_AUDIT_LOG_TABLE_SQL`` -- the
canonical CREATE TABLE used by the test path -- never reached the
production audit_log table because the original migration
``a8b1c2d3e4f5_add_audit_log_and_triggers.py`` predated both
additions and the rebuild migration ``a5be2a99ea14`` uses
``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` so it leaves an existing table
untouched:

  * ``executed_at`` is canonically ``NOT NULL DEFAULT now()`` but the
    migration-built column is nullable.
    ``8a21d16c9bde_tighten_audit_timestamp_nullability_`` deliberately
    limited its sweep to ``user-facing schemas`` and skipped
    ``system``.
  * ``ck_audit_log_operation`` (``CHECK operation IN ('INSERT',
    'UPDATE', 'DELETE')``) is missing from the migration-built table
    entirely.

The trigger function always populates ``executed_at`` via the
``DEFAULT now()`` clause and always emits a TG_OP value in the
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE set, so practical impact is nil today -- but a
future caller that bypasses the trigger (a future raw-SQL INSERT, a
``pg_dump`` reload that omits the column, an off-trigger forensic
backfill, a buggy script that writes ``TRUNCATE`` as the operation)
would corrupt the forensic trail under one column or the other.
Symmetric storage-tier guarantees across the create_all and
migration paths close both gaps.

Pre-flight detection refuses the upgrade if any pre-existing row
violates either predicate -- should be impossible given the trigger
contract, but cheap to verify.  If the assertion ever trips, an
unknown writer has been bypassing the trigger and the operator
needs to investigate before constraining the column.

    Two pre-flight queries refuse the upgrade if any pre-existing row

    produces NOT NULL and the CHECK) and tightens the production

"""a settle carries the DAY the money moved, and the click instant is deleted

Plan step X-f1b of ``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``, ruling
**R-EC** (2026-08-03).

**The column stored the wrong fact, and eleven readers corrected for it.**
``transactions.paid_at`` is ``db.func.now()`` at the moment the user clicks
"mark paid" (the status seam), and the API refused any other value.  Nothing in
the application needs that instant: an AST census of ``app/`` found **14 sites
turning it into a civil day -- 11 call sites across 8 modules** over three
helper layers, and **zero** templates, JavaScript files or serialized payloads
reading the column itself.  Nothing anywhere ordered or compared two instants.
So the app carried a precise measurement of a bookkeeping keystroke and derived
the fact it actually needed -- which day the money moved -- eleven times over.

Measured on a 2026-08-03 production clone, **65.2% of the settled Checking rows
share a click-minute with another row** (88 of 135, largest batch 6), so for two
thirds of that account the instant describes when the user sat down to do the
books, not when the bank moved money.

``settled_on`` replaces it rather than joining it (ruling R-EC).  Keeping both
would leave two columns stating one fact, which is this arc's own root cause 1
and the mirror image of the defect plan step S1-c removed one table over
(``transaction_entries.entry_date`` carrying two facts).

**No BALANCE moves the day this ships, and one soft metric does.**  The backfill is the DELETED derivation
verbatim -- ``COALESCE((paid_at AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York')::date,
pay_period.start_date)``, which is exactly what
``app.utils.dates.to_display_civil_date`` computed at each of the eleven read
sites -- so every settled row keeps the day the engine already gave it.  The
zone is ruling R-DH (b): the derived day is compared against and bucketed by
plain ``DATE`` columns that mean the USER's civil days
(``pay_periods.start_date`` / ``end_date``), so deriving it in UTC compares two
calendars.  ``America/New_York`` is pinned as a literal here for the same reason
migration ``c4a19e7b2d80`` pins it: a migration is a historical record of what
ran, and reading a live constant would let a future config change silently
rewrite what this backfill meant.

**The one figure that DOES move is the payment-timeliness metric, and it moves
on a day nothing observed** (finding N-181).  The 8 legacy settled rows whose
``paid_at`` was NULL take their pay period's ``start_date`` here, exactly as
every reader already derived for them -- so no balance moves.  But
``Transaction.days_paid_before_due`` gated on "was an instant recorded" and now
gates on "is the row settled", so those 8 enter
``spending_analysis.payment_timeliness_from_txns`` for the first time.  Measured:
the four expense legs report 8 days early, on time, on time and 1 day late.
Narrowing this backfill to ``paid_at IS NOT NULL`` was REJECTED -- it leaves 8
settled rows undated, which the balance walk now REFUSES, trading a soft metric
for a 500 on the grid.  Recorded rather than glossed, because
``verify_balance_baseline.py`` structurally cannot see it: it is not a balance.

**The NULL is the invariant, not a gap.**  ``settled_on`` is written for every
row in a SETTLED status (Paid / Received / Settled) and left NULL for every
other, so *a row is settled if and only if it carries a settle day*.  Measured
on the same clone: **0 of 741 non-settled rows carry a ``paid_at``** and all 156
settled rows resolve a pay period, so the backfill establishes the invariant
exactly rather than approximately.  Soft-deleted rows are backfilled too --
nothing excludes them, because a restore must not resurrect a settled row with
no day.

**Why there is no CHECK.**  The invariant's predicate lives in ``ref.statuses``
(``is_settled``), and a CHECK constraint cannot join; hardcoding the three
settled ids into one would be the magic-number defect the project's own
standards forbid, and would break the moment a status is added or removed (plan
step **X-am** proposes removing one).  It is enforced STRUCTURALLY instead:
``status_seam.apply_status_change`` is the single door that writes
``status_id`` and it writes the day in the same call, so the two cannot diverge.
There is no bound on the value either -- a settle legitimately precedes its
budget period (21 of the 156 settled rows on this clone fall outside it -- 11
before its start and 10 after its end), and a "not in the
future" rule is not expressible in a CHECK because it is not immutable.

**Destructive, and the downgrade REFUSES.**  A date cannot reconstruct an
instant.  Every settled row's day is either the backfill's or a correction the
user typed, and after the drop nothing distinguishes them or re-derives either,
so ``downgrade`` raises with the literal recovery SQL rather than silently
fabricating 148 timestamps -- the shape ``.claude/rules/database.md`` prescribes
when a downgrade cannot be faithful.  Recorded honestly rather than glossed:
``system.audit_log`` holds a ``paid_at`` for only **106 of the 148** rows (its
retention window starts 2026-05-06), so the reassuring "the audit trail has it"
is false for 42 of them and those instants are lost for good.

**A rollback of the deploy carrying this migration is NOT a pure digest
revert.**  The schema moves forward and the previous image's code selects
``paid_at``; reverting the image alone leaves it querying a dropped column.
Rolling back means running this ``downgrade`` (accepting its refusal and the
recovery path) or restoring from backup.  Stated here because this arc's ship
notes assert the opposite for migration-free ships and the distinction must not
be assumed.

Review: developer, 2026-08-03 (ruling R-EC, taken on the "which option is what I
should do if I were building everything from scratch" framing, with the
destructive migration, the always-refusing downgrade, and the permanent loss of
42 instants all stated before the ruling was taken).

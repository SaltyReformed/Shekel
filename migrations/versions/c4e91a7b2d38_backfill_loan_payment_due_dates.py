"""backfill loan-payment due_dates to their true contractual due date

A loan payment's ``due_date`` is the installment it satisfies -- the loan's
``payment_day`` of some month.  Legacy loan-payment rows instead stored the
START of the pay period the recurrence generated them into: ``compute_due_date``
(:mod:`app.services.recurrence_engine`) falls back to ``period.start_date`` for
any rule carrying no ``day_of_month``, and nothing read the column back, so the
wrong value was harmless.

**It is no longer harmless: ``due_date`` is now a POSTING INPUT.**  The
amortization engine reads the stored value
(``loan_loaders.loan_payment_due_date``) -- it must, because a payment settled
LATE sits in a pay period that no longer contains its due date, and re-deriving
the due date from that period reports the NEXT month's installment (a July
payment shown as an August one, and a CONFIRMED schedule row stamped with a
FUTURE date, which breaks every date-basis balance walk that reads it).  The
genesis write walk
(``loan_posting_service._walk._merge_anchor_and_payment_events``) now orders
payments and applies the strict ``anchor_date < due_date`` post-anchor boundary
against it, so a wrong ``due_date`` changes which payments an anchor SUBSUMES
and therefore the POSTED balance.

Consequences for anyone changing this column in future:

* Any write to a loan payment's ``due_date`` MUST be followed by a posting
  reconcile (``loan_posting_service.sync_loan_postings_all_scenarios``), or the
  posted ledger and the resolver silently disagree.  ``transfer_service``
  enforces this by listing ``due_date`` in ``_POSTING_RELEVANT_FIELDS``.
* This migration's own rewrite is reconciled by the deploy pipeline:
  ``scripts/init_database.py`` runs ``upgrade(head)`` and THEN
  ``backfill_all_loan_postings()`` (reconcile-to-target, idempotent), so the
  ledger is re-derived from the corrected dates before a single request is
  served.  **A bare ``flask db upgrade`` does NOT run that hook** -- a local
  verification must call ``loan_posting_service.backfill_all_loan_postings()``
  directly afterwards (the same caveat ``f2a7c1e9b4d3`` carries).

Scope -- the LEGACY SIGNATURE, not "any date that looks odd".  A row is legacy
iff its stored ``due_date`` equals a pay-period START date for that user, which
is precisely what the fallback writer produced.  (It may be the start of a
DIFFERENT period than the row now sits in: a payment moved after generation
keeps the original period's start.)  Deliberately NOT keyed on "the day-of-month
differs from ``payment_day``": an operator may legitimately set a due date off
the contractual day (a servicer moves the date; a one-off arrangement), and
rewriting that to the next ``payment_day`` would silently move the payment to
the FOLLOWING month's installment.  Rows already correct are selected only when
their due date coincidentally falls on a period start, where the rule maps them
to themselves (a date already on ``payment_day`` is its own first
``payment_day`` on or after itself), so they are skipped unchanged.

All THREE rows of a transfer are rewritten together -- the parent
``budget.transfers`` and BOTH shadow ``budget.transactions``.  The parent is the
canonical value (Transfer Invariant 3; ``transfer_service.update_transfer``
mirrors it to both shadows), and the full-edit form pre-fills its input FROM the
parent -- so correcting only the income shadow would leave a stale parent that a
no-op "Save" would write straight back over the correction, re-posting the wrong
balance.

Verified against real production data -- 5 rewritten rows, and the rule recovers
each installment exactly:

    txn 1456  2026-03-26 (payment_day 1)  -> 2026-04-01
    txn 1458  2026-04-23 (payment_day 1)  -> 2026-05-01
    txn 1460  2026-05-21 (payment_day 1)  -> 2026-06-01
    txn 2162  2026-04-09 (payment_day 22) -> 2026-04-22
    txn 2164  2026-05-21 (payment_day 22) -> 2026-05-22

Review: developer, 2026-07-12.  Data-only (no business-table schema change); the
prior value of every row it rewrites -- transfer and both shadows -- is
snapshotted into ``system.loan_due_date_backfill`` so ``downgrade`` restores the
exact pre-migration state rather than re-deriving (and thereby corrupting
correctly-stored rows).

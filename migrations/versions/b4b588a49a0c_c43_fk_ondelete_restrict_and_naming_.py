"""C-43: ref-FK ondelete=RESTRICT sweep + transfers.pay_period_id alignment
+ FK naming-convention forward enforcement

Closes audit findings F-073 (Medium), F-078 (Medium), and F-136 (Low)
of the 2026-04-15 security remediation plan.  Two groups of DDL
operations plus one documentation deliverable:

  1. **Ref-FK ondelete sweep (F-073).**  Nine foreign keys that
     reference ``ref.*`` lookup tables were created without an
     explicit ``ondelete`` clause and therefore defaulted to
     PostgreSQL's implicit ``NO ACTION``.  Coding standards (see
     ``docs/coding-standards.md`` "SQL / Database / Schema Design")
     require ``ondelete="RESTRICT"`` for every ref-table FK.  The
     practical distinction matters because:

       * ``NO ACTION`` defers the check to the end of the
         transaction, so a multi-statement transaction that deletes
         a ref row and then re-inserts a dependent row may succeed
         (violating the operator's expectation that the catalog
         protects the seed data).
       * ``RESTRICT`` raises immediately on the offending DELETE
         statement, giving a clean traceback at the point of the
         violating operation.

     The nine FKs recreated (old name -> new name):

       * ``ref.account_types.category_id``:
         ``account_types_category_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_account_types_category_id``
       * ``budget.savings_goals.goal_mode_id``:
         ``fk_savings_goals_goal_mode_id`` (name preserved;
         ondelete only)
       * ``budget.savings_goals.income_unit_id``:
         ``fk_savings_goals_income_unit_id`` (name preserved;
         ondelete only)
       * ``salary.paycheck_deductions.calc_method_id``:
         ``paycheck_deductions_calc_method_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_paycheck_deductions_calc_method_id``
       * ``salary.paycheck_deductions.deduction_timing_id``:
         ``paycheck_deductions_deduction_timing_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_paycheck_deductions_deduction_timing_id``
       * ``salary.salary_profiles.filing_status_id``:
         ``salary_profiles_filing_status_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_salary_profiles_filing_status_id``
       * ``salary.salary_raises.raise_type_id``:
         ``salary_raises_raise_type_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_salary_raises_raise_type_id``
       * ``salary.state_tax_configs.tax_type_id``:
         ``state_tax_configs_tax_type_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_state_tax_configs_tax_type_id``
       * ``salary.tax_bracket_sets.filing_status_id``:
         ``tax_bracket_sets_filing_status_id_fkey`` ->
         ``fk_tax_bracket_sets_filing_status_id``

     ``ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT`` followed by ``ADD
     CONSTRAINT`` is used (not ``ALTER CONSTRAINT``) because the
     ondelete clause is part of the constraint definition and
     PostgreSQL has no in-place form for changing it.  Both
     statements run inside the migration's single transaction,
     so the window during which the FK is absent is invisible to
     concurrent statements.

  2. **transfers.pay_period_id realignment (F-136).**  Sibling
     tables that share ``pay_period_id`` (``budget.transactions``,
     ``budget.account_anchor_history``) CASCADE on the pay-period
     parent; ``budget.transfers`` alone uses RESTRICT.  The
     asymmetry was unintentional drift and produces two concrete
     bugs:

       * User account deletion fans out into ``pay_periods``,
         ``transactions``, and ``transfers`` simultaneously
         through their respective user_id-CASCADE FKs.
         PostgreSQL evaluates every referential action for one
         DELETE in a single pass; the RESTRICT on
         ``transfers.pay_period_id`` previously raised even
         though every row was destined for deletion.
       * The transfer invariant (every transfer has exactly two
         linked shadow transactions) becomes briefly violated
         during a pay-period deletion: the shadows cascade
         through ``transactions.pay_period_id``-CASCADE first,
         then the RESTRICT on ``transfers.pay_period_id`` rolls
         the whole DELETE back -- leaving the operator with a
         confusing "cannot delete from pay_periods" error that
         masks the real reason (the orphan-shadow guard).
         Switching to CASCADE makes the cascade atomic: transfer
         + shadows + pay_period all disappear together.

     The FK is dropped and recreated with name
     ``fk_transfers_pay_period_id`` and ``ondelete="CASCADE"``.

  3. **Forward naming-convention enforcement (F-078).**  The
     companion ``app/extensions.py`` change documents
     ``SHEKEL_NAMING_CONVENTION`` -- a dictionary mirroring the
     placeholder template SQLAlchemy's
     ``MetaData.naming_convention`` would consume if the dictionary
     were applied globally.  It is NOT applied globally because
     doing so causes the chain-replay path (the test template build
     via ``scripts/build_test_template.py``) to render new
     constraint names for the un-named
     ``sa.ForeignKeyConstraint`` calls in pre-C-43 migrations,
     which then breaks the later migrations that DROP those
     constraints by their original dialect-default names.

     Forward enforcement is instead manual: every new
     ``ForeignKey``, ``UniqueConstraint``, ``CheckConstraint`` in a
     model carries an explicit ``name=`` shaped by the convention.
     The contract is enforced by code review and by the regression
     test
     ``tests/test_models/test_c43_ondelete_and_naming_convention.py``
     which asserts the explicit-name rule for every ref-FK and the
     transfers.pay_period_id FK touched by this commit.

     The remaining ~35 Alembic-default ``<table>_<column>_fkey``
     names in pre-C-43 migrations are retained -- retroactive
     renames are high churn for cosmetic gain and Alembic
     ``compare_metadata`` matches FKs by structural signature, not
     by name, so the inconsistency does not produce phantom
     autogenerate diffs.

All operations are idempotent.  FK drop/recreate is guarded by a
``pg_constraint`` check for the new name with the new ondelete; if
both already match, the operation is skipped.  This makes the
migration safe to replay against any combination of databases: a
fresh test template that runs the chain to head, a production DB
that pre-dates these constraints, and a sandbox DB that has been
hand-corrected.

Downgrade is symmetric.  FK changes reverse to the original
ondelete (``NO ACTION`` for the seven that originally lacked an
explicit clause; ``NO ACTION`` for the two savings_goals FKs which
were also created without an explicit ondelete in
``4f2d894216ad``) and the original constraint name.  No data is
touched in either direction.

Review: solo developer, 2026-05-12 (audit 2026-04-15, C-43
retroactive sweep).  Destructive (audit tags D-12 + D-13 + D-14):
the upgrade drops and recreates 10 FK constraints (group 1 +
group 2), each classified under "constraint removal" and "rename"
by the destructive-migration policy in
``docs/coding-standards.md``.  Downgrade is symmetric and fully
working.

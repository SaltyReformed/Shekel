"""add ck_recurrence_rules_dom and ck_recurrence_rules_moy CHECK constraints

Closes H-3 of docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/model-migration-drift.md.
The model app/models/recurrence_rule.py declares three CHECK
constraints on budget.recurrence_rules:

  * ck_recurrence_rules_dom: day_of_month IS NULL OR (1..31)
  * ck_recurrence_rules_due_dom: due_day_of_month IS NULL OR (1..31)
  * ck_recurrence_rules_moy: month_of_year IS NULL OR (1..12)

The migration chain materialises only ck_recurrence_rules_due_dom (via
f15a72a3da6c_add_due_date_paid_at_to_transactions_.py).  The other two
were never added to a migration, so production has been accepting
out-of-range values (day_of_month=99, month_of_year=15) that the
recurrence engine would translate into impossible dates -- silently
generating transactions on dates that do not exist and corrupting
balance projections downstream.

Pre-flight detection refuses the upgrade when any pre-existing row
violates a predicate; the operator resolves by editing the offending
row and re-runs.  Mirrors the C-24 sweep pattern in
b71c4a8f5d3e_c24_marshmallow_range_check_sweep.py -- per
docs/coding-standards.md the migration never auto-rewrites data.

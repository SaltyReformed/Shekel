"""A row's delete never takes its movements, and a match's movement key stops cascading

Revision ID: c4a4e7d1b9f2
Revises: 2eabfa596ee0
Create Date: 2026-09-22 22:40:00.000000
Review: developer, 2026-09-22 / 2026-09-23 (rulings R-CC54 parts (2) and (3),
R-CC63..R-CC66, R-CC82: three foreign keys dropped and re-created NO ACTION,
and the two refusals before them; R-CC89 and R-CC92: the deleted-row
triggers)

Plan step ``credit_card:CC-5-4a-4``.  Rulings **R-CC54** parts (2) and (3)
(developer 2026-09-22): *"The database stops cascading a row's delete to its
payments and purchases.  A row holding one is history, so the template and
account permanent deletes archive instead, and truncate/regenerate lock its
period ... A match's key to its payment or purchase stops cascading, like its
key to the bank line.  The screens' leftover-match check is deleted."*  With
**R-CC63**..**R-CC66**, which carry the rule to the archives, the
object layer, the reset and the transfer doors.  Closes ledger row
**CC-363**.

**What was wrong.**  ``budget.transaction_entries`` keyed its parent row with
``ON DELETE CASCADE`` twice (the single-column ``transaction_id`` key and the
composite ``fk_transaction_entries_owner_transaction``), so every statement
that deleted a row deleted the payments and purchases under it -- and three
doors did that as a SIDE EFFECT of deleting something else: the template and
account permanent deletes in bulk SQL, and the pay-period truncate /
regenerate / reset through ``transactions.pay_period_id``'s own cascade.
Measured on the production dump of 2026-09-22 17:06: permanently deleting
template 19 'Clothes' destroyed a $107.57 purchase recorded 09-20 and moved
Checking's 09-10-period projection from $187.12 to $787.12.  And a match's
key to its movement cascaded too, so a destroyed movement left its act naming
a bank line alone -- a false "explained" a predicate in the one read that
decides (``_candidates.act_still_names_a_row``) stopped counting rather than
anything preventing.

**What this revision does.**  All three keys become ``NO ACTION``: a row
holding a movement cannot be deleted, and a movement a match names cannot be
deleted, by any statement.  The single-column key is re-created under a name
(``fk_transaction_entries_transaction_id``; it carried Postgres' default until
now).  No row moves and no value changes -- the application's doors, in the
same release, keep a row holding a movement instead of deleting it, and the
one act that takes a movement off the books removes it from its matches and
then deletes it before its row.

**Why it refuses on a stranded act.**  The leftover-match check is deleted in
the same release because this revision makes its subject unrepresentable --
but only going FORWARD.  An act that ALREADY names no movement (its last one
destroyed by a cascade before today) would, with the check gone, read as
explaining its bank lines forever.  Measured 0 of 284 on the 17:06 dump; a
non-zero count is the developer's to rule, so the revision names the acts and
writes nothing.

**Why it refuses on a hidden row holding a movement** (ruling **R-CC82**,
developer 2026-09-23: *"The release's database update counts such rows and
refuses to run if any exist, naming them, the same way it already refuses on
orphaned statement matches."*).  The same release makes a deleted recurring
occurrence give up its payments and purchases (ruling **R-CC75**) and an
archive hide only rows holding nothing (**R-CC63**) -- going FORWARD.  A row
the code before it hid while it still held one would lock its pay period
(truncate, regenerate and reset refuse over it) with no screen able to reach
the row.  Measured 0 on production at 2026-09-23 12:08 UTC.  **A transfer's
shadow is excepted** (the developer's follow-up the same morning, "Non-transfer
rows"): the transfer's own soft delete still hides a leg holding its kept
payment after this release, which is finding **BAL-532**'s
(``balance:X-bi-6-4``) to end, and a refusal over a state the release goes on
creating would stop nothing it fixes.

**And a deleted row holds no money from here on** (ruling **R-CC89**,
developer 2026-09-23: *"The database refuses any payment or purchase written
under a deleted row, so no door, now or later, can do it."*, and **R-CC92**
extending it the same day, "Refuse both ways": hiding a row that still holds
one is refused too, a transfer's leg excepted as BAL-532's until X-bi-6-4).  The revision installs
:mod:`app.deleted_row_infrastructure`'s two triggers after the keys: a
movement arriving under a deleted row is refused, and so is a commit that
leaves a non-transfer row hidden while it holds one.  Each grades a write,
never a stored row, so neither refuses anything already there -- and the
refusal above has already stopped the upgrade over the one stored state the
second would forbid.  The downgrade removes them FIRST, before the keys
cascade again, and they depend on nothing the key flips do.

``tests/test_models/test_cc5_4a4_row_keeps_its_movements.py`` drives the
shipped ``upgrade`` / ``downgrade``: each key's refusal after the upgrade and
its cascade after the downgrade, both refusals and their controls, the
triggers' install and removal, and the round trip.

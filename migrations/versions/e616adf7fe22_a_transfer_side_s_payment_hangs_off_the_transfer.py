"""a transfer side's payment hangs off the transfer

Revision ID: e616adf7fe22
Revises: 1f431fec6547
Create Date: 2026-10-08
Review: developer, 2026-09-20 / 2026-09-22 / 2026-09-30 (ruling R-BAL88:
``transaction_entries.transaction_id`` made nullable under an exactly-one-parent
CHECK, and the two side keys; R-BAL107: the transfer owner keys; R-BAL168: the
side keys ON UPDATE CASCADE; R-CC89 / R-CC92 carried to a transfer: the
deleted-row triggers re-created with their transfer arm)

Plan step **balance:X-bi-6-4d-2** of ``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``
(design ``X-bi-6-4d`` D1).  **A transfer side's payment record is filed under
the TRANSFER, not under the hidden twin row the transfer service keeps for that
side.**  Until now each side's record hung off its twin
(``transaction_entries.transaction_id`` = the twin's id), so every reader of a
transfer's money walked a row whose only job was to copy the transfer.  After
this revision every STORED record names its transfer by one of two SIDE LINKS,
and no twin holds one.  **No figure, day, account or statement link moves**: the
same 44 rows keep their ids, amounts, days, bases, accounts, matches and
postings, and only the column that says what they are filed under changes.

  1. **``budget.transfers``** gains the superkeys ``uq_transfers_id_from_account``
     / ``uq_transfers_id_to_account`` and the owner keys
     ``fk_transfers_owner_from_account`` / ``fk_transfers_owner_to_account``
     onto ``uq_accounts_id_user`` (ruling **R-BAL107**: a transfer naming another
     user's account is unstorable).
  2. **``budget.transaction_entries``** gains ``expense_transfer_id`` and
     ``income_transfer_id``, each keyed WITH ``account_id`` onto its side's
     superkey (ruling **R-BAL88**), so a side's record on any account but that
     side's endpoint is unstorable.  Both keys are ``ON UPDATE CASCADE`` (ruling
     **R-BAL168**: an endpoint move carries the side's record) and NO ACTION on
     delete (**R-CC54**).  ``transaction_id`` becomes NULLABLE under
     ``ck_transaction_entries_one_parent`` (exactly one of the three is set);
     ``ck_transaction_entries_side_link_is_a_record`` makes every side link a
     settlement record; ``uq_transaction_entries_one_expense_side_record`` /
     ``..._one_income_side_record`` allow one per side.  Every new constraint
     holds on the stored rows before the backfill (every link is NULL), so the
     DDL runs first and the backfill is graded row by row as it writes.
  3. **The backfill**: every movement under a twin takes that twin's transfer
     as its side link -- the INCOME twin is the to-side, the expense twin the
     from-side, which is how the fold and the ledger have always read a twin --
     and its ``transaction_id`` goes NULL, in ONE statement.
  4. **The deleted-row rule gains its transfer arm**
     (:mod:`app.deleted_row_infrastructure`, ``TRANSFER_ARM``): a payment may
     not arrive under a deleted transfer, read under the same row lock (ruling
     **R-CC96**), and a transfer may not be hidden while a side links one --
     and the row arm loses R-CC92's carve-out for a transfer's leg, which
     holds nothing now.
  5. **The band rule** (:mod:`app.side_band_infrastructure`, design D8): a
     side's record is dated exactly while its transfer is settled, and a
     settled transfer records both sides or, closed at zero, neither -- a
     deferred constraint trigger, installed LAST.

**The upgrade REFUSES, writing nothing, while any stored row could not take its
link**, each named with the query that finds it (fail-closed, the shape
``c4a4e7d1b9f2`` uses for ruling **R-CC82**): a movement under a twin that is
not a settlement record, not on its side's endpoint, or under a deleted twin or
a deleted transfer (the last two would be a hidden parent holding money, the
state the transfer arm forbids); two records on one side of one transfer; a
transfer naming an account its owner does not hold.  After the backfill, and
before either rule is installed, it refuses the same way while a transfer's
records break the band rule (step 5).  Every count is 0 where the transfer
service wrote the rows.

**Measured on the 2026-10-08 14:34 EDT production dump** (at ``1f431fec6547``):
179 transfers, 358 twins, 44 movements under a twin -- 22 per side, every one a
dated settlement record on its side's endpoint, under a live twin of a live
Paid transfer; 0 transfers naming another owner's account; 19 statement match
members naming one of the 44 (they key by the movement's id and account, which
do not change).  0 refused.  The migration prints its own counts so the operator
compares them with the rehearsal's.

**The downgrade re-attaches each record to its side's LIVE twin** (a transfer
has at most one per side, ``uq_transactions_transfer_type_active``) and
refuses, writing nothing, while a record's side has none: a twin hidden around
the transfer service (Transfer Invariant 4 drift, which no door writes), or no
twin at all (a state only a LATER revision that deletes the twins can leave,
and that revision's downgrade rebuilds them first).  A deleted twin cannot take
the record back -- the row arm the downgrade restores refuses a movement
arriving under a deleted row -- and a record under a hidden TRANSFER cannot
exist at this revision, which the transfer arm refuses.  Then it drops the new
constraints and columns and restores ``transaction_id``'s NOT NULL, refusing if
any row would violate it.

**What the downgrade does NOT restore, and the refusal that makes that safe.**
From this revision the app no longer writes a twin's status, settle day, day
basis or statement link: the status seam's Transfer arm writes each side's
record alone, and a twin keeps only its mirrored period, category, due date,
override flag, ownership, account and name.  So after any settle, revert, day
or figure correction made at this revision, a twin's status and day no longer
say what its transfer and record say, and this downgrade, which moves only the
records' parent column, would leave a dated record under a twin still saying
Projected (or an un-dated one under a twin saying Paid) -- what the code below
this revision reads as a drifted pair.  **So the downgrade REFUSES, writing
nothing, while any twin disagrees** (:func:`refuse_drifted_twins`; the
cp2b-1 review's L-4, fail-closed): this revision is never downgraded alone on
a database the app has written at it.  It ships with plan step
``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3``'s revision in ONE release, and that revision's
downgrade, which rebuilds the twins, rebuilds each twin's status, settle day,
basis and statement link from its transfer and its side's record first, after
which the census reads zero.  **On the 2026-10-08 production dump it reads
zero before this revision** (358 twins, 102 of them deleted, 44 records: every
twin's status is its transfer's, and every twin's day, basis and link are its
record's, NULL where it holds none), so a downgrade straight after the
upgrade, with no app write between, passes.  The stored money is exact either
way: no record, posting or match is written by the downgrade but each
record's parent link.

``tests/test_models/test_a_transfer_side_s_payment_hangs_off_the_transfer.py``
drives the shipped ``upgrade`` / ``downgrade`` and each refusal.

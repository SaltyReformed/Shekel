"""the two-axis columns become authoritative

Plan step **R7c-b** of ``docs/plans/implementation_plan_recurrence_redesign.md``
section 4 -- the MIGRATE half of an expand / migrate / contract.  Plan step
R7c-a added five columns, backfilled them and had the write door keep them in
step while NOTHING read them; this leaf moves every reader across and locks the
columns down behind them.  Plan step R7c-c drops the closed set they replace.

Review: Josh, 2026-08-14 -- APPROVED at R7c-a: the D28 ruling that ``starts_on``
is the rule's FIRST OCCURRENCE (one meaning for every unit), the three-leaf
split with the destructive DDL last, and this leaf carrying the ``NOT NULL``
tighten and the ``end_date >= starts_on`` CHECK.
Review: Josh, 2026-08-15 -- APPROVED: the form authors one date plus a
conditional day, and ``ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day`` is COMPLETED with the
clamp equality so the runtime guard that stood in for it becomes structurally
unnecessary.
Review: Josh, 2026-08-15 -- APPROVED, REVERSING the ``end_date >= starts_on``
half of the first line: ``ck_recurrence_rules_valid_window`` is HELD BACK from
this leaf.  See "The window CHECK is not here, and why" below.

What it does, and why each half waited for this leaf
----------------------------------------------------

1. **RE-RUNS R7c-a's backfill**, the identical statement out of
   :mod:`migrations._recurrence_two_axis_backfill`.  That leaf's dual write
   refreshes the two-axis columns on every RULE write and on no other event, so
   a pay schedule REBUILT between the two leaves moves the derivation and leaves
   the column where it was -- ``loan_recurrence_sync._sync_loan_cadence`` makes
   the window plain, since it returns early when the loan's own facts have not
   moved.  Nothing read the column in between, so nothing was wrong; from this
   migration the stored value is authoritative, and a stale one would FREEZE a
   first occurrence the app no longer derives.  Re-running the identical text
   makes the cutover a no-op by construction rather than by argument.

2. **TIGHTENS four columns to NOT NULL** -- ``unit_id``, ``placement_id``,
   ``shift_id`` and ``starts_on``.  This is the third step of the documented
   three (``.claude/rules/database.md``: add nullable, backfill, tighten) and it
   belongs with the leaf that makes the columns MATTER: nothing read them at
   R7c-a, so a NULL was invisible; every reader takes them now, so a NULL is a
   wrong answer.  ``nominal_day`` stays nullable and always will -- its ABSENCE
   is the discriminator (ruling R-R3), meaning "the date holds the day itself".

3. **COMPLETES ``ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day``** with the clamp equality.
   The R7c-a form bounded the domain (29-31) and required the nominal day to
   exceed the date's, which admits ``(starts_on = 2026-04-15, nominal_day = 30)``
   -- a nominal day beside a date that was never clamped.  Only a runtime guard
   in ``recurrence._occurrence._require_generable`` caught that, which is a
   fence over a state the schema should make unrepresentable.  Adding
   ``EXTRACT(day FROM starts_on) = LEAST(nominal_day, <that month's last day>)``
   closes it, and the guard is DELETED in the same commit.  Verified IMMUTABLE
   on the live server rather than assumed: ``date_trunc(text, timestamp)`` is
   immutable where the ``timestamptz`` overload is only stable, which is why
   ``starts_on`` is cast explicitly -- the same overload trap R7c-a's own review
   caught.

4. **ADDS ``ck_recurrence_rules_starts_on_range``**: the first occurrence falls
   inside the calendar this application reaches, 2000-01-01..2100-12-31 -- the
   same two dates ``ck_template_amount_versions_effective_date_range`` bounds
   the other user-authored date with, now named once in
   ``app.utils.dates.CALENDAR_DATE_MIN`` / ``_MAX``.  It backs a MEASURED 500:
   past the saved horizon the pay calendar projects the covering paycheck by
   adding ``cadence_days`` to a start, so ``?starts_on=9999-12-31`` on the
   recurrence-preview endpoint -- which reads the value from ``request.args``,
   where no schema stands -- raised ``OverflowError: date value out of range``
   from ``pay_calendar._calendar._projected_after`` for any signed-in user.
   ``_resolution._require_authored_start_window`` is the door-side mirror; this
   is the backstop behind it.

The window CHECK is not here, and why (developer ruling, 2026-08-15)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

``ck_recurrence_rules_valid_window`` -- ``end_date >= starts_on`` -- was drafted
into this leaf and is HELD BACK.  It asserts an invariant the table does not
have yet, because these columns hold two different kinds of fact:

* what a USER AUTHORS about a repeating definition, where a stop before the
  start is a mistake to report;
* what the APP DERIVES for a recurring loan payment, where an EMPTY window is a
  legitimate and sometimes correct answer.  ``loan_recurrence_sync`` writes
  ``starts_on`` = the loan's first contractual installment and ``end_date`` =
  its derived payoff, and a loan paid off BEFORE its first installment inverts
  the pair honestly.  Measured: originate 2026-08-01 with ``payment_day`` 1, so
  the first installment is 2026-09-01; true the balance to zero on 2026-08-15
  and ``recurrence_end_date`` answers ``as_of`` = 2026-08-15.  Forward
  generation emits nothing, which is exactly right -- the loan owes nothing --
  and the CHECK turns that correct state into an unhandled ``CheckViolation``
  out of the true-up, a params edit, or any transfer settle.

Both local repairs are worse than the state.  Clamping the bound up to
``max(as_of, starts_on)`` admits ONE occurrence, so a paid-off loan keeps a
projected payment whose cash still debits while the fold books the whole amount
to Refund.  Archiving the template from inside a sync is a destructive side
effect on a path that runs on every settle, and a corrected true-up would not
undo it.

So the invariant is held at the two AUTHORING doors instead, which is where a
user's mistake can be reported at all:
``schemas/validation/_helpers.require_end_bound_after_start`` for a create, and
``_recurrence_form_helpers.refuse_inverted_window`` for an update, which
compares the EFFECTIVE start against the EFFECTIVE bound and so also covers the
submission that moves ``starts_on`` PAST a stored ``end_date`` -- a case no
schema can see.  The CHECK lands with the step that stops persisting the
derived window (``loan_recurrence_sync`` becomes a resolver and generation
applies the loan's window over the rule's own), at which point every row is
user-authored and the constraint is unconditionally true.

Measured on a 2026-08-15 clone of production (46 live rules)
------------------------------------------------------------

**Re-measured on a FRESH clone, and this revision RUN end to end against it**
(2026-08-15).  An earlier draft of this block was taken on a database migrated
from an earlier draft of this file -- it carried only two of the constraints,
so the third and ``refuse_out_of_range_starts`` were unbacked, and one claim
below was simply wrong.  The clone this states was dumped from
``shekel-prod-db`` at ``alembic_version = c4e1a8b70f36`` (before either R7c
leaf) and upgraded to head.

* 0 rows hold a NULL in any of the four columns being tightened, so the tighten
  runs clean;
* 0 rows carry a ``nominal_day`` at all, so the completed CHECK admits every
  live row trivially.  It was therefore probed against real data rather than
  argued: rule id=2 starts 2026-03-26, a day MARCH holds, and setting
  ``nominal_day = 30`` on it is refused by
  ``ck_recurrence_rules_nominal_day`` -- which is the ``(2026-04-15, 30)``
  shape the R7c-a predicate admitted;
* the 5 end-dated rules span 96, 8280, 1037, 1037 and 1006 days.  **The first
  is three MONTHS, not years**, which an earlier draft of this block claimed of
  all five; it is recorded because a "years apart" reading is what would make
  the window comparison look untestable on live data;
* 0 rows carry a ``starts_on`` outside 2000-2100, so the calendar-window CHECK
  admits every live row -- the 46 span 2026-03-01 to 2027-03-16, comfortably
  inside it;
* the re-backfill in item 1 moved NOTHING: the same 46 rows, the same span, the
  same 0 nulls before and after, which is the no-op the cutover needs it to be.

Each is CHECKED rather than trusted: a state a constraint would refuse is named
with its rule ids before the DDL runs, because ``ALTER TABLE ... ADD CHECK``
reports the table and not the row.

**Downgrade RAISES**, and the reason is the re-backfill above rather than the
DDL.  Loosening the constraints is loss-free in itself; what is not safe is
what an operator does next.  Re-``upgrade`` would run item 1 again, over rules
this very revision's write door authored -- and that door does not write
``start_date`` or ``month_of_year``, two of the three columns the derivation
reads.  Measured on this suite's fixtures: a MONTHLY rent authored to first
occur ``2026-09-15`` comes back ``2024-01-15``, backdated 32 months onto the
schedule's opening, which is the backdated-generation shape
``_recurrence_form_render.create_form_default_starts_on`` exists to make
unreachable.

Restoring the legacy columns from ``starts_on`` inside the downgrade was
weighed and REJECTED: it round-trips every cadence except ``Monthly First``,
whose derivation scans the schedule's months rather than reading a day, so the
closed set cannot express "the 15th, funded from that month's first paycheck"
-- measured, ``2026-03-15`` comes back ``2026-04-01``.  A downgrade that is
faithful for six cadences and silently wrong for the seventh is worse than one
that refuses.

The refusal follows ``.claude/rules/database.md``'s stated alternative: it
names why it is unsafe and gives the literal SQL to loosen the schema by hand.
Reverting the DATA needs a restore.  Developer ruling, 2026-08-15.

Revision ID: b6d41f0a9c27
Revises: b7c3d9e1f204
Create Date: 2026-08-15

**Re-pointed off ``f2a94c7e1b60`` when this branch merged ``dev``**, which had
landed ``b7c3d9e1f204`` (a purchase is a ledger source) from the same parent.
Two heads, and the two touch different tables -- that one
``budget.purchases``, this one ``budget.recurrence_rules`` -- so the chain
LINEARISES rather than needing a merge revision. Safe because neither revision
has run in production: the clone this was measured on stamps
``c4e1a8b70f36``.

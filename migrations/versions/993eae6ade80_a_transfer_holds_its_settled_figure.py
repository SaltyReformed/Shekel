"""a transfer holds its settled figure: the figure and who wrote it, once, on the transfer

Revision ID: 993eae6ade80
Revises: 82f7b7ed4332
Create Date: 2026-10-24
Review: developer, 2026-10-22 (ruling R-BAL365: a settled transfer stores its
figure and who wrote it, 0.00 for a close of nothing; ruling R-BAL366: the
figure lives on the transfer and a side's record holds none)

Plan step **balance:X-bi-6-4d-2** of ``docs/audits/balance_architecture/README.md``
(its 4d-4 half, first commit).  **A settled transfer's figure had two homes**:
each side's payment record carried ``amount`` and ``figure_source_id``, and the
one writer (the status seam's Transfer arm) wrote the same pair onto both.  The
transfer's money is ONE figure, so this revision gives it one home on the
transfer, ``budget.transfers.settled_figure`` and ``settled_figure_source_id``,
and every reader reads it there:

  1. **It refuses, writing nothing, while a stored transfer's records do not
     state one figure** (:func:`refuse_unfigured_transfers`), each named with
     its class and the query that finds it: a record on ONE side only; two
     records whose figure or source differ; a SETTLED transfer holding no
     record; a settled transfer holding an un-dated record.  The last class is
     the band rule's (``e616adf7fe22``), which refuses it at every commit, and
     is re-counted here because the copy below would carry it.  A settled
     transfer holding no record is a ``$0.00`` close from before this revision,
     which stores no figure source (rulings **R-BAL82**, **R-BAL141**): this
     revision writes NO guess for one (who typed the zero cannot be read back),
     and its repair is in the refusal's words.  Measured on production before
     the build: every class empty (the 4d-4 design record
     ``o2_zero_close_count_PRODUCTION.md``); the release rehearsal re-counts.
  2. It adds the two columns, the source's key onto
     ``ref.movement_figure_sources`` (``RESTRICT``) and two CHECKs: the figure
     is never negative (``$0.00`` stays storable until plan step
     ``balance:X-db``, ruling R-BAL365), and the pair is stored whole or not
     at all.
  3. It copies each transfer's figure and source off its from-side record --
     DATED under a settled transfer, UN-dated under one a revert kept them for
     (ruling **R-BAL61**) -- and checks every transfer holding records got one.

**The records keep their copy in this revision**: the next revision of the same
step empties them and makes a side record holding a figure unstorable.  That
transitional second copy lives only inside the held branch, which never ships
without the next revision.

The downgrade drops the columns.  The records still state the figure, so
nothing is lost -- unless a figure stored on a transfer disagrees with its
records, which no door writes and the downgrade refuses, named, rather than
discarding the figure the app was reading.  A ``$0.00`` close stored since the
upgrade holds no record and becomes the close of nothing it was before this
revision.

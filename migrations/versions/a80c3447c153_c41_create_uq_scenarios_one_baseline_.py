"""C-41 / F-069: create uq_scenarios_one_baseline partial unique index in prod

Closes audit finding F-069 (commit C-41 of the 2026-04-15 security
remediation plan) and the production side of H-2 in
``docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/model-migration-drift.md``.

The partial unique index ``uq_scenarios_one_baseline`` on
``budget.scenarios (user_id) WHERE is_baseline = TRUE`` was declared
by the upgrade body of
``c5d6e7f8a901_add_positive_amount_check_constraints.py`` (migration
#7 in the chain) but the production database never carried it.  The
production schema was bootstrapped via
``scripts/init_database.py`` -> ``db.create_all()`` -> Alembic
``stamp head`` (per the rebuild-audit-infrastructure migration's
docstring), which materialises the schema from model declarations
rather than running the migration chain.  At bootstrap time the
``Scenario`` model in ``app/models/scenario.py`` did NOT declare the
partial unique index inline, so ``db.create_all()`` produced a
scenarios table without it.  The index was added to the model only
in commit ``709786a`` (2026-05-10, H-2 model-side fix), well after
production had already been bootstrapped, so the production schema
remained drifted.

H-2 of the drift catalogue closed the test-side gap (the model now
declares the index, so the test-template path via ``flask db upgrade``
materialises it on every per-pytest-worker DB clone), but production
still lacks the storage-tier backstop.  Without the index the
``budget.balance_calculator`` would silently pick one of two baseline
scenarios per user when computing projections, producing different
answers depending on which ``Scenario`` row the ORM returned first --
a load-bearing correctness bug because every balance projection
starts from "the user's baseline scenario."

The route layer already enforces idempotency in two places:
``app/routes/grid.py::create_baseline`` checks for an existing
baseline before inserting a new one, and
``app/services/auth_service.py::register_user`` creates the user's
canonical baseline exactly once at sign-up.  In normal operation no
duplicate baselines can be created.  The partial unique index is the
storage-tier backstop against any future caller -- a script, a
hypothetical RPC handler, a concurrent registration race -- that
bypasses those route-layer checks.  Defense in depth: the route
checks catch "almost all" duplicates; the index catches "every"
duplicate.

The findings catalogue (F-027 -- duplicate CHECK constraints on
``budget.transactions``) was originally bundled with F-069 into this
commit per the plan.  The CHECK-duplication half was closed earlier
by migration
``724d21236759_drop_redundant_transaction_check_.py`` (commit
``9a5cca1``, 2026-05-10), so this migration only handles the F-069
side.  See
``docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/model-migration-drift.md`` H-1 for
the duplicate-CHECK history.

Pre-flight duplicate-baseline detection refuses the upgrade if any
user already carries two or more baseline scenarios.  Auto-resolving
duplicates would mean choosing one to keep -- a financial decision
the migration cannot make on the operator's behalf (the wrong choice
would silently change the user's balance projections).  The operator
must reconcile duplicates by hand after confirming which scenario
holds the user's intended baseline data.

The DDL step is guarded by :func:`_index_exists` so the migration is
idempotent: a no-op against the test-template path (which already
carries the index from ``c5d6e7f8a901``) and a real cleanup on a
fresh-from-migrations production database.

A post-creation shape check verifies the index is unique and has the
expected ``WHERE is_baseline = ...`` partial predicate.  An index
carrying the right name but the wrong predicate (e.g.,
hand-recreated without the WHERE clause) would silently downgrade
the constraint to "at most one Scenario row per user" -- breaking
the multi-scenario product entirely -- so the shape check refuses to
silently accept that state.

The upgrade body delegates to module-level helpers
(``_preflight_duplicate_baselines``, ``_create_index_if_missing``,
``_assert_index_shape``) so the regression tests in
``tests/test_models/test_c41_baseline_unique_migration.py`` can
exercise each step against the live test database without spinning
up an Alembic ``MigrationContext`` -- the helpers accept a SQLAlchemy
``Connection`` rather than calling ``op.get_bind()`` directly.

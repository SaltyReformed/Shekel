"""purge the phantom loan payments generated before their loan originated

The data half of plan step C9a.  ``a1c7e2f4b930`` stops the recurrence engine
from GENERATING a payment before its loan exists; this removes the rows the
missing bound already produced.

**What these rows are.** ``create_payment_transfer`` (and the generic
``POST /transfers`` path) built a rule with no start bound and generated an
installment into every materialized pay period, including those preceding the
loan's origination.  Measured on a mortgage closing 2026-04-15: three of four
generated payments were pre-origination.  Each one debits the cash projection
for a loan that does not exist yet, and each becomes a money erasure the moment
it settles -- the fold splits a payment whose installment falls at or before
origination against a ZERO balance, booking $0.00 principal and routing the whole
payment to a Refund Receivable, after which the origination anchor resets the
balance over it.

**Scope -- the same safety predicate the recurrence engine itself applies**
(``_recurrence_common.partition_regeneration_rows``), so this deletes only what a
routine regeneration would already delete:

* the row is template-linked (AUTO-GENERATED, not hand-created);
* its status is NOT immutable -- a settled payment is never touched (see below);
* it is not ``is_override`` (hand-edited) and not soft-deleted;
* and its installment falls at or before the loan's ``origination_date``.

The installment is ``COALESCE(due_date, monthly_due_date(period start,
payment_day))`` -- the same derivation ``loan_loaders.loan_payment_due_date``
applies, so this selects exactly the rows the fold would erase, not "rows that
look old".

**A SETTLED pre-origination payment is deliberately left in place and reported.**
Its cash really did leave the funding account, so deleting it would silently
hand the money back; and it carries posting-ledger entries, which raw SQL must
not strand (only settled transfers post -- verified on real data: 151 projected
transfers, zero journal entries; 14 paid, 16 entries).  Such a row is an
F1-class data correction needing a human decision (was it a down payment? should
it reduce the opening principal?), so ``upgrade`` prints it loudly rather than
guessing.  There are none on production data.

Verified against the dev clone before writing: **zero** rows match on either
count -- both real loans originated (2018-12-01, 2023-02-14) long before any
materialized pay period.  This revision is therefore a no-op there and exists
for any database that carries the shape.

Destructive (deletes ``budget.transfers`` rows; their shadow
``budget.transactions`` follow by ``ON DELETE CASCADE``).  Every deleted row --
parent and both shadows -- is snapshotted whole into
``system.pre_origination_purge`` as ``jsonb``, so ``downgrade`` restores the
exact pre-migration state rather than re-deriving it.

Review: developer, 2026-07-19 (ruling: "C9 should clean up the problem that it
causes").

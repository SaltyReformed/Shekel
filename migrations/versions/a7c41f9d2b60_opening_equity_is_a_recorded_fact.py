"""Opening equity is a recorded fact, not a position in the assertion series.

Plan step **balance:X-f3c-2a**, ruling **balance:R-GX**.

Creates ``ref.account_opening_sources`` and ``budget.account_openings``, and
backfills ONE row per existing account carrying the figure the balance fold was
already re-deriving on every read -- so the migration moves ``$0.00`` on every
surface by construction.

**What the figure is.**  An account's opening equity is the capital its books
opened with: what it held before any of its recorded movements.  Until this
step no table held it; ``balance_at._cash_fold._actual_steps`` recomputed it per
read as "the earliest assertion's balance, less the movements that assertion
already contained" (ruling R-I), and used it as the fold's seed.

**Where the backfill takes it from, and why not from a re-derivation.**  Both
values come from rows already in the database -- the posted double-entry ledger
-- so this migration contains no second implementation of the walk's valuation
rule.  Re-deriving it in SQL would have meant restating
``cash_ledger.settled_cash_leg`` (``owned_contribution - credit entries -
posted purchases``) in a migration that then goes stale the day that rule
changes, which is exactly the two-statements-of-one-rule defect the balance arc
exists to close.

Two readings are taken and they must AGREE, or the migration refuses. **They
are not INDEPENDENT and an earlier draft of this docstring claimed they were**:
both come from the posted ledger, so they are the stored result of
``walk_account_ledger`` and its recomputation. What the pair detects is a posted
ledger that is INCOMPLETE for an account -- which is the failure that would
silently seed ``$0.00`` -- and not a divergence between the posted ledger and
the cash fold. That equality is asserted by measurement instead: 1,829 balance
readings across nine accounts, identical either side of this step.

The two readings are:

* ``E_entry``  -- the ``account_opening`` journal entry's LINKED leg;
* ``E_checked`` -- the earliest assertion's balance, less the linked-leg
  postings of non-anchor sources dated on or before the opening day.

They disagree exactly where the posted ledger is incomplete for an account (a
baseline-less owner is skipped by ``sync_account_anchor_postings_all_scenarios``
with a log line, so an account CAN be missing its postings), and there
``E_entry`` alone would silently seed ``$0.00`` and move every balance on that
account.  Measured on a production clone 2026-08-27, the two agree to the cent
on all seven non-loan accounts: Checking ``$689.16``, Fidelity Savings
``$4,863.56``, Money Market ``$4,879.26``, Roth IRA ``$22,909.02``, Traditional
IRA ``$9,771.48``, 401(k) ``$26,912.56``, Home ``$350,000.00``.

**The two AMORTIZING accounts are backfilled too, from the read fold's own
arithmetic** (``A0 - P0`` over the cash walk), because the posted ledger holds
no ``account_opening`` entry for a loan -- ``walk_account_ledger`` refuses an
amortizing account outright, loans booking their openings through the loan
posting package.  They need a row all the same: ``balance_at.balance_at``
dispatches on ``_resolution.configured_loan``, which answers ``None`` for an
amortizing account carrying no ``LoanParams``, and falls through to this fold.
For those two the cross-check is against the ASSERTION series rather than the
journal, and the same refusal applies.

**Every row is tagged ``migration_derived``**, which is a financial statement
rather than a label.  A derived figure is the pre-X-f3c-2a inference frozen and
it may be WRONG: finding **balance:N-275** measures account 1's opening
``$436.05`` short of the bank's own closing for the same day, and the developer's
Fidelity export shows account 10's books really opening at ``$1,345.74`` on
2026-01-30 rather than at the ``$4,879.26`` this seeds.  Freezing today's figure
is what makes the migration balance-neutral; the tag is what stops a later
reader mistaking it for something anybody observed.

Review: not required -- this migration is purely additive.  It creates two
tables and inserts; it drops nothing, renames nothing, and alters no existing
column.

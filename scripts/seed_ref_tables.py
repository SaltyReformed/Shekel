"""
Shekel Budget App -- Seed Reference Tables

Populates ref-schema lookup tables for all phases: account types,
transaction types, statuses, recurrence patterns, filing statuses,
deduction timings, calc methods, tax types, and raise types.

Uses upsert pattern to avoid duplicates on re-run; delegates to
``app.ref_seeds.seed_reference_data`` -- the single source of truth
for ref-table seeding across the application factory, the deploy, this
script, the pytest fixture stack, and the test-template builder.  See
audit finding H-002 for the rationale.

The deploy no longer runs this script: entrypoint step 3
(``scripts/init_database.py``) seeds inside its one transaction, before
anything reads ``ref_cache`` (plan step balance:X-cv, ruling R-BAL122).
This is the operator's repair tool, and it builds the app WITHOUT the
eager ``ref_cache.init`` (ruling R-BAL123, finding BAL-536): that init
treats a missing row as fatal, so a tool that ran it first died on
exactly the database it exists to repair.

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_ref_tables.py

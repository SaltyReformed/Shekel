"""
Shekel Budget App -- Seed User & Default Data

Creates the single Phase 1 user by delegating to
``auth_service.register_user`` -- the same provisioning path the
/register route uses -- so the seeded user is identical in shape to a
self-registered one: user, settings, the pay-period schedule, checking
account (with origination anchor history), baseline scenario, default
categories, and default tax configuration.  This script owns only the
operator-facing policy around that call: env parsing, production
password guards, the idempotent already-exists skip, redacted
logging, and the credential scrub.  (Historically it hand-copied the
provisioning sequence and had already drifted from the service --
e.g. it never seeded tax data.)

Validates that the password is at least 12 characters, matching the
minimum enforced by the application's change_password() and
register_user() functions.  Exits with code 1 if the password is
too short.

**SEED_USER_LAST_PAYDAY is REQUIRED and has no default** (plan step X-ad-a,
ruling R-DB).  Registration stopped inventing a pay period at sign-up because
an invented payday is never the owner's real one and blocks them from entering
it (finding **N-123**); defaulting the seeded operator's payday to "today"
here would put that same fabrication back on the one path that provisions the
production account.  There is no honest default for the day somebody was last
paid, so the script refuses rather than guesses -- the same shape as its
refusal of the documented default password in production.  The cadence and the
horizon DO default, to the app-wide constants, because those are stated
premises rather than facts about one person.

After seeding completes (or returns early on an existing user), the
SEED_USER_PASSWORD and SEED_USER_EMAIL values are scrubbed from
``os.environ`` and the C-level environment.  This is defense-in-depth
against a future caller (or a child process spawned during seeding)
reading the credential back out of the process environment after it
has served its one-shot purpose.  The matching scrub in
``entrypoint.sh`` removes the same variables from the parent shell
before exec'ing Gunicorn -- closing the ``cat /proc/<gunicorn>/environ``
exposure called out in audit finding F-022.  See audit finding F-022
and remediation Commit C-34.

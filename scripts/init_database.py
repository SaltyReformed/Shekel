"""
Shekel Budget App -- Database Initialization

Detects fresh vs. existing databases and initializes accordingly:

- Fresh DB: creates all tables via SQLAlchemy metadata, materialises
  the ``system.audit_log`` infrastructure (table, trigger function,
  and per-table audit triggers), then stamps Alembic to mark every
  migration as applied.  The audit-infrastructure step is the
  difference vs. ``db.create_all()`` alone -- the audit triggers,
  function, and table are raw SQL outside SQLAlchemy's model registry,
  so a bare ``create_all`` would skip them and the deploy's audit-trigger
  check (:func:`app.audit_infrastructure.require_audit_triggers`) would
  refuse the deploy.  See audit finding F-028 and remediation Commit C-13.

- Existing DB: runs incremental Alembic migrations, then the three
  deploy hooks that reconcile the posted ledger.  An existing DB
  that pre-dates Commit C-13 picks up the rebuild migration on the
  next ``flask db upgrade`` and the GRANT block inside the migration
  applies once the ``shekel_app`` role has been provisioned by
  ``scripts/init_db.sql``.

Both paths then run the same sequence (ruling R-BAL122): the reference
rows are seeded, ``ref_cache`` is loaded from them, the hooks run (an
existing database only), every user's missing tax defaults are seeded,
and the audit triggers are counted -- the work entrypoint steps 4, 6
and 7 used to do after this script had committed (:func:`_bring_to_release`).

**All of it is ONE transaction, committed once** (plan step
balance:X-cv, ruling R-BAL105).  The deploy opens that transaction on a
connection of its own and commits it once, itself: the
migrations run on that connection (:mod:`app.migration_runner`), and
the app's session JOINS the transaction for everything else (rulings
R-BAL113, R-BAL118), so a hook that refuses, a migration that fails, a
seed that errors or a missing audit trigger leaves every row where the
deploy found it, ``alembic_version`` included (sequence counters, which
PostgreSQL does not roll back, still advance).  That stamp is what
``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh`` reads
to decide a rollback: unmoved, the previous image can still resolve
it, and the script re-pins that image on its own instead of refusing
and naming a dump to restore.

Database role policy:

    This script is part of the deployment pipeline -- not the
    application's request-time path -- so it always runs as the
    owner role (``DATABASE_URL``), never as the least-privilege app
    role (``DATABASE_URL_APP``).  ``DATABASE_URL_APP`` is overridden
    to the empty string (= unset, per the config resolver's contract)
    at the top of the file before ``create_app()`` reads it; this
    scopes the override to this process only and does not affect the
    Gunicorn process that ``entrypoint.sh`` exec's afterwards.

Usage:
    python scripts/init_database.py

    The steps below run in order -- with the append-only, level-within-file,

    documented where it runs -- every one on the deploy's ONE connection
    and none of them committing (plan step balance:X-cv):
    :func:`initialise_database` commits them together.  A failure part-way
    therefore leaves the database as empty as it found it, instead of a
    half-built schema that the next boot reads as "existing"
    (:func:`is_fresh_database` asks only for ``auth.users``) and tries to
    migrate from no stamp.

    1. ``db.metadata.create_all`` on that connection -- materialise every
       SQLAlchemy-modeled table.  This covers the ``ref``, ``auth``,
       ``budget``, and ``salary`` schemas.  Not ``db.create_all()``:
       Flask-SQLAlchemy runs that on a connection of its own and commits it.
    2. ``apply_audit_infrastructure`` -- materialise the
       ``system.audit_log`` table, the trigger function, the indexes,
       the per-table triggers (one per entry in
       :data:`app.audit_infrastructure.AUDITED_TABLES`), and the
       conditional ``shekel_app`` GRANT block.  ``db.create_all`` does
       not know about any of these -- they are raw SQL outside the
       SQLAlchemy model registry -- so this second step is what
       distinguishes fresh-DB initialisation post-C-13 from the
       previous bypass-of-audit-triggers behaviour that audit
       finding F-028 documents.
    3. ``apply_posting_infrastructure`` -- materialise the
       ``budget.assert_journal_entry_balanced`` function and the deferred
       ``ck_account_postings_balanced`` constraint trigger that enforces
       the per-journal-entry sum-to-zero / at-least-two-legs invariant.
       Like the audit trigger, these are raw SQL outside the model
       registry, so ``db.create_all`` (which made the
       ``budget.account_postings`` table) does not create them.
    4. ``apply_opening_infrastructure`` -- materialise
       ``budget.account_books_opened_on`` and the five deferred
       constraint triggers of every arm in ``ALL_ARMS`` that make a
       settled movement (plan step X-f3c-2b) or a matched bank line dated
       on or before its account's books open unstorable, graded from the
       row's side and from the opening's.  Raw SQL outside the model
       registry, exactly like the two above, so ``db.create_all`` does not
       produce it.  There is nothing to legalise on this path: the
       database is empty.
    5. ``apply_ledger_append_only_privileges`` -- revoke UPDATE/DELETE
       on the two ledger tables from ``shekel_app`` (review M1/R4).
       Required on this path specifically: ``init_db_role.sql`` ran
       BEFORE the tables existed (its table-guarded REVOKE skipped),
       and the stamp in step 6 marks the revoke migration
       (``e3c23fadb21d``) as applied without running it.
    6. ``alembic stamp head`` -- mark every migration as applied so
       subsequent ``flask db upgrade`` calls only apply
       newly-authored migrations.  On the same connection
       (:func:`app.migration_runner.stamp_head`), so the stamp commits
       with the schema.

    midnight -- on production, one ``$1,910.95`` mortgage payment stamped
    2026-07-02 00:38:53 UTC that belongs to the evening of 2026-07-01.

    settle on" is the property the whole balance arc exists to hold, so it drives
    the go-forward sync instead
    (:func:`app.services.posting_service.resync_all_cash_postings`).

    **It runs FIRST of the three, and the order is the dependency direction.**
    The anchor walk computes each correction's ``ledger_before`` from the source
    postings on the account's linked ledger, so the sources are brought to target
    before the corrections that sit on top of them are reconciled.  (The anchor
    walk reads posting AMOUNTS grouped by source rather than their dates, so this
    ordering is defence rather than a live coupling -- stated so a later reader
    does not reorder it on the assumption that it is arbitrary.)

    Runs only on the existing-database path (a fresh database has no settled
    sources).  Idempotent and self-healing via reconcile-to-target, so it is safe
    on every deploy: a source already at target posts nothing.  Commits nothing
    itself: its re-posts commit with the migrations and the other two hooks in
    the deploy's ONE transaction (plan step balance:X-cv), where the deferred
    balanced-journal trigger validates every entry, so an unbalanced re-post
    aborts the deploy loud.  Until plan step ``X-bi-6-5`` the resync itself
    also refuses while any transfer still holds a nonzero legacy one-entry
    posting -- one whose family it had to skip (ruling **R-BAL104**).  Since
    X-cv that refusal rolls the migrations back with it, so the stamp stays
    where the previous image can resolve it and ``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh``
    re-pins that image on its own -- the manual dump restore ruling
    **R-BAL105** accepted until then is gone.  The release rehearsal on a
    same-day dump still meets it first.

    Returns:
        str: The line the deploy log prints once the one commit has landed --
        the count of sources CHANGED, not walked (finding N-133 / F8).  A
        steady-state deploy prints zeroes; a non-zero line is the operator's

    1. The schema to head: the first-boot build (:func:`init_fresh_database`)

    2. The reference rows (:func:`app.ref_seeds.seed_reference_data`): every

       built-in account types' flags are brought to this release's values.

    **Why the seed precedes the cache.**  ``ref_cache.init`` refuses a ref

    that entrypoint step 4 made before seeding (``scripts/seed_ref_tables.py``
    built the app with the eager init) stopped every new production install
    there, and every restart after it in step 3 (finding **BAL-536**).  On an
    existing database, reading the cache straight after the migrations also
    served as an alarm for a migration that forgot its own inline seed; with
    the seed first there is nothing for that alarm to protect -- the seed
    supplies the row before anything reads it -- and a migration that reads a
    row it forgot to seed STRICTLY (one row required, or a NOT NULL insert)
    still fails inside the chain, where the test-template build meets it
    first.  A lenient read (an ``INSERT ... SELECT`` or an ``UPDATE ... SET x =
    (SELECT ...)`` that finds nothing) would quietly do nothing there and in a
    deploy alike; no gate sees that case.

    Steps 2, 5 and 6 were entrypoint steps 4, 6 and 7, each run after step 3
    had committed, so a failure in one left the release's stamp behind a dead
    container: the case ``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh`` cannot re-pin.  Here a
    failure in any step rolls back with the rest.

    Every line these steps print is printed before the commit, as the
    first-boot build's are: only :func:`initialise_database`'s closing line
    says the work landed.

def _session_joined_to(connection):
    """Make ``db.session`` a session JOINED to the deploy's transaction, for the block.

    Rulings **R-BAL113** and **R-BAL118**.  The hooks, ``ref_cache`` and
    :func:`is_fresh_database` all use the global ``db.session``.  For the deploy
    that name must mean a session whose every statement runs on *connection*,
    inside the transaction :func:`initialise_database` opened on it, and which
    cannot end that transaction.

    **Why not ``db.session.configure(bind=connection)``.**  Flask-SQLAlchemy
    3.1's ``Session.get_bind`` returns an engine and ignores a session-level
    bind (``flask_sqlalchemy/session.py``), so a configured bind would leave
    every query on a pooled connection of its own, outside the deploy's
    transaction.  So this puts a plain SQLAlchemy ``Session`` in the scoped
    session's slot for the current app context (``scoped_session.registry``)
    and takes it out again afterwards; the hooks' code is unchanged.  What the
    plain class lacks is Flask-SQLAlchemy's bind-key routing (this app has one
    database) and its ``Query`` subclass's ``*_or_404`` / ``paginate`` (request
    helpers no service calls).  The app's one session listener
    (:mod:`app.db_transaction`) is registered on SQLAlchemy's base ``Session``
    class, so it fires here as it does everywhere else.

    **Joined in ``rollback_only`` mode, with ``autobegin`` off.**  Joining the
    connection's open transaction means a session ``commit()`` is not passed to
    it, so the deploy's own ``commit()`` is the only one.  A session
    ``rollback()`` IS passed, so it ends the deploy's transaction and the
    deploy's commit then raises ``This transaction is inactive``.  With
    ``autobegin`` off the session holds exactly one transaction, the one begun
    here: after a stray ``commit()`` or ``rollback()`` its next statement raises
    ``Autobegin is disabled on this Session``.  With autobegin on, that
    statement would instead begin a transaction of the session's own on the
    connection, and a later ``commit()`` after a rollback WOULD commit it:
    the hooks' writes landing without the migrations the rollback undid
    (measured 2026-09-23 on a throwaway database, before ruling R-BAL118).

    The block BORROWS the app context's session slot.  Whatever session the
    context held is put back untouched when the block exits, so a caller's
    uncommitted work is neither committed nor discarded here.  In the deploy
    process the slot is empty, so it is simply cleared.

    Args:
        connection: The deploy's connection, inside its one open transaction.

    Yields:
        None: ``db.session`` is the joined session until the block exits.

def initialise_database():
    """Run entrypoint step 3 as ONE transaction and commit it once (plan step balance:X-cv).

    Ruling **R-BAL105**'s future step.  Before it the migrations committed in
    ``migrations/env.py``'s own transaction BEFORE the three deploy hooks ran,
    so a hook that refused (ruling **R-BAL104**'s legacy-net refusal, the loan
    sync's checked-projection assert, an unbalanced entry at a hook's commit,
    the anchor walk's refusals)
    left a stamp the previous image could not resolve, and
    ``deploy/shekel-deploy.sh`` refused to re-pin it: a manual dump restore.
    Now the deploy opens a connection and a transaction of its OWN, and the
    fresh-database build or the migrations, the reference and tax seeds,
    ``ref_cache``, the three hooks and the audit-trigger check
    (:func:`_bring_to_release`) all run inside it: Alembic on the connection,
    everything else through a session joined to it
    (:func:`_session_joined_to`).  The deploy's
    ``commit()`` below is the ONLY one.  Any exception before it propagates,
    the process exits non-zero, and closing the connection rolls the whole
    transaction back, ``alembic_version`` included.

    **Nothing the session or the migration runner does can commit, early or
    partially** (rulings **R-BAL113**, **R-BAL118**).  A session ``commit()``
    does not reach the deploy's transaction.  A stray session ``commit()`` or
    ``rollback()`` followed by any further statement on the session fails the
    deploy with nothing saved, and a ``rollback()`` after the last session
    statement makes this commit raise ``This transaction is inactive`` on an
    existing database (the audit-trigger count that follows runs on the
    connection, in a transaction of its own that closing the connection
    discards).  On a first boot the same rollback has also undone the schema,
    so that count finds no trigger and refuses first, with a message that
    blames a missing trigger rather than the rollback; nothing is saved
    either way.  Only a ``commit()`` after the last session statement is
    harmless, and it saves nothing this commit would not.  A rollback
    followed by Alembic rather than the session (the first-boot build's
    stamp comes after its nine session-routed infrastructure steps) meets
    :func:`app.migration_runner._config`, which puts the connection back
    inside a transaction nobody commits.  ``ref_cache.init`` rolls back when a
    ref table is missing (``_load_rows``), but since ruling R-BAL122 the
    reference seed reads every table the cache reads before it does (measured
    2026-09-23, again at salary:S11-a's merge: the cache's 28 tables are all
    among the seed's 29), so a missing table fails the seed first; the cache's
    rollback is unreachable from the deploy while that holds.  None of the
    three hooks' services, and neither seed, commits or rolls back (census
    re-run 2026-09-23: the two
    ``rollback()`` calls a hook's module holds --
    ``loan_posting_service._sync.sync_all_scenarios_or_duplicate`` and
    ``ref_cache._state._load_rows`` -- are the rate-history door's and the
    missing-table path; their SAVEPOINTs are ``begin_nested`` blocks, which
    never end the deploy's transaction; the seeds' only commits are their
    scripts' own wrappers, which the deploy does not call).

    **What neither can see is a second CONNECTION, a CONNECTION-level commit,
    or a raw ``COMMIT``.**  A hook that opened a connection of its own
    (``db.engine.connect()``) would run outside the deploy's transaction
    altogether; ``db.session.connection().commit()`` or a migration's
    ``op.get_bind().commit()`` would commit the deploy's transaction in place;
    and a ``COMMIT`` sent as SQL would end it at the server without SQLAlchemy
    knowing.  The census (2026-09-23, re-run at salary:S11-a's merge, over
    ``app/``, ``migrations/versions/`` and ``scripts/seed_tax_brackets.py``,
    which all run inside the transaction) finds none of the three: no
    ``db.engine``, ``create_engine`` or ``engine.connect``, no ``.commit()`` on
    a connection or bind, and no ``COMMIT`` / ``ROLLBACK`` statement text.

    The session is FLUSHED before the commit, never committed: its pending ORM
    state reaches the connection, and the deploy commits the connection.

# Shekel Budget App -- Test Runner Wrapper
#
# Gives the run a PRIVATE POSTGRES CLUSTER, then runs pytest against it
# with whatever arguments were passed, forwarded verbatim:
#
#     ./scripts/test.sh                           # full suite
#     ./scripts/test.sh tests/test_routes/...     # targeted run
#     ./scripts/test.sh -n 0 -x                   # pass-through flags
#
# A cluster of this run's own
#     The container comes from the image ``scripts/build_test_db_image.py``
#     bakes -- the test template already inside it -- and is reached over a
#     UNIX SOCKET in a per-run directory.  It is removed afterwards.  Its
#     whole life -- the socket directory, the ``docker run`` and its
#     settings, the readiness wait and the teardown -- is
#     ``scripts/private_cluster.py``'s, the one home the release rehearsal
#     kit's bench (``tools/rehearsal/bench.py``) starts its own cluster
#     through too; this wrapper makes the token that owns the cluster, arms
#     the traps that stop it by that token, and runs pytest against it.
#
#     NOTHING IS SHARED, SO NOTHING NEEDS COORDINATING.  Until
#     ``balance:X-br-4`` this wrapper also carried a hygiene restart, a
#     live-backend probe, a per-worktree template name and a per-worktree
#     worker-database prefix, and the repo carried a suite-slot lock beside
#     them.  Every one of those existed because ONE postmaster served every
#     worktree; a cluster per run leaves each of them nothing to protect, so
#     they were deleted rather than kept as a second way to do nothing.  It
#     also fixes what none of them ever did: two runs in the SAME worktree.
#
#     WHAT THE DELETION DOES NOT FIX is that concurrent runs still share the
#     host's cores.  That is a resource fact rather than a defect, so this
#     script REPORTS the other runs it can see and proceeds -- see the block
#     above the container name for the measurement and the argument.
#
#     What it costs, measured 2026-09-05 on ``tests/test_utils/`` (385
#     tests), same host, back to back: 12.7 s against the shared cluster,
#     14.1 s here with the image already built and its layers warm, 22.0 s
#     on the first run after a rebuild.  The fixed part is the image
#     verification (1.4 s) plus the container's whole life -- start,
#     readiness and removal -- which is 0.33 s.
#
#     NO PORT IS PUBLISHED.  The cluster serves one process on this machine,
#     and on a rootless daemon a published port is a 25-40% failure: docker
#     allocates it inside the container's network namespace and rootlesskit
#     binds that number on the HOST.  ``scripts/private_cluster.py`` holds
#     the measurements.
#
#     THE DAEMON IS NOT THE SYSTEM ONE.  A container per run on the system
#     daemon is exactly the churn ``docs/test-harness-isolation.md`` was
#     written to stop: that daemon runs the production database and the
#     homelab wud/cadvisor/alloy stack watches every container on it.  So
#     this refuses a non-rootless daemon rather than quietly spamming it.
#
# Environment variables read:
#     DOCKER_HOST        The daemon this run talks to.  Auto-selected from
#                        ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` when unset and a rootless socket
#                        is there, then EXPORTED so pytest and
#                        ``tests/test_deploy``'s conftest see the same
#                        endpoint this script chose.
#     XDG_RUNTIME_DIR    Holds the rootless socket that is auto-selected, and
#                        the per-run socket directory
#                        (``scripts/private_cluster.py`` makes it).  Default:
#                        ``/run/user/$(id -u)``.
#     SHEKEL_ALLOW_HOST_DOCKER  ``1`` accepts a non-rootless daemon.  Shares
#                        its spelling with ``tests/test_deploy/conftest.py``
#                        on purpose.
#     CI                 Sanctions a non-rootless daemon, since a CI daemon
#                        is a throwaway nothing observes.  Read through a
#                        truthy vocabulary, NOT by presence: ``CI=false``
#                        must not sanction anything.
#     READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS  Cap on the readiness wait, read by
#                        ``scripts/private_cluster.py``.  Default: 15.
#     TEST_DB_IMAGE      An image to use INSTEAD of building and verifying
#                        one.  Skips build_test_db_image.py entirely, so
#                        whoever sets it owns the image's correctness.  Its
#                        one caller today is
#                        tests/test_scripts/test_test_runner/, which drives
#                        a stub docker that cannot satisfy a real
#                        verification.  It is NOT set by CI: CI's jobs run
#                        this wrapper like any other run and bake the image on
#                        their own runner (``bank_import:X-gy``).  Unset is
#                        the developer's case and every real run, and is
#                        verified on every invocation.
#     PYTEST_MARKER_EXPR Marker expression handed to pytest.
#                        Default: ``not docker`` (see the note above the
#                        pytest invocation at the bottom of this file).
#                        An explicit ``-m`` in the caller's arguments wins,
#                        because pytest keeps the last one.
#
# What it does NOT read, and where those went:
#     TEST_DATABASE_URL / TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL are EXPORTED by this
#     script, not read from ``.env``: they name this run's socket, which no
#     dotenv can know.  ``TEST_TEMPLATE_DATABASE`` and ``TEST_DB_PREFIX``
#     are gone entirely -- a private cluster holds exactly one template and
#     one run's worker databases, so there is nothing to rename them away
#     from.  Their single spellings now live as constants in
#     ``tests/conftest.py``, ``scripts/build_test_template.py`` and
#     ``scripts/build_test_db_image.py``, which must agree.
#     LC_ALL is EXPORTED too, over any value the caller had: ``create_app``
#     refuses to start under anything but production's locale (ruling
#     recurrence:R-R92), so the suite -- and CI, which runs it through here --
#     always runs under that locale.
#
# Exit codes:
#     Whatever pytest returns, in the ordinary case.  A bootstrap failure
#     exits 2 without running pytest: no python interpreter, no docker, a
#     daemon that is not rootless or cannot be reached, a socket path over
#     the kernel's 107-byte limit or not UTF-8, an image that cannot be
#     prepared, a container name docker refuses, a cluster that does not
#     accept connections within READINESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, and one that
#     reports ready without leaving a socket (``scripts/private_cluster.py``
#     refuses the socket path, the readiness and the missing socket, and
#     any other start it cannot finish).  NO COUNT IS GIVEN:
#     every attempt to count them in a comment
#     has been wrong.  A run that INT, TERM or HUP ends has no status: it
#     stops its cluster, then dies BY that signal, as a command a terminal's
#     Ctrl-C ended does (the block above the traps says why).  Other
#     non-pytest statuses are docker's or the shell's, not this script's.

# THE DAEMON THIS RUN TALKS TO.
#

# homelab wud/cadvisor/alloy stack watches every container on it -- exactly
# the churn ``docs/test-harness-isolation.md`` exists to stop.  So the
# harness picks a rootless daemon of its own, and REFUSES rather than
# quietly spamming the system one.  Fail-closed: an absent rootless daemon
# stops the run with instructions, it does not fall back.
#
# The test asks the daemon WHAT IT IS instead of pattern-matching the socket
# path.  "Rootless" is a property of a daemon; a path is a guess about one,
# and the guess has a hole -- a tcp:// endpoint pointed at a socket-proxy
# container reads as isolated while being the production daemon wearing a
# different address.
#
# Exporting DOCKER_HOST also lets ``tests/test_deploy`` run: its conftest
# reads this variable and treats any non-default endpoint as isolated.  That
# only takes effect for a caller who ALSO asks for those tests with
# ``PYTEST_MARKER_EXPR=docker``, because this wrapper defaults to
# ``not docker`` further down and the marker deselects them before the
# conftest is consulted.  An earlier draft of this comment claimed the

# WHO ELSE IS RUNNING, AND WHY THIS IS A NOTE RATHER THAN A LOCK.
#
# ``scripts/suite_slot.sh`` was a real mkdir-based mutex every gating run had
# to take, and ``balance:X-br-4`` deleted it.  Its header named TWO hazards and
# a cluster per run only kills one of them:
#
#   * CORRECTNESS is now structural.  Nothing can restart another run's
#     postmaster and nothing can collide on a database name, because there is
#     no shared postmaster and no shared name space.  A lock bought exactly
#     this and no longer buys it.
#   * CONTENTION SURVIVES, because the cores do not multiply.  Measured
#     2026-09-05 on this 24-core host: one suite alone finished in 349 s; with
#     THREE running (two private clusters plus a peer's gating run) two of them
#     reached only ~38% in 13 minutes, at a run-queue of 32, ~950,000 context
#     switches/sec and 28% iowait.  No test FAILED in either -- the slowest
#     single test is 2.58 s against pytest.ini's per-test timeout (30 s then;
#     90 s from 2026-09-13 and 50 s since 2026-09-22, sized to CI's clock --
#     docs/testing-standards.md, Test Run Guidelines), so there was roughly
#     11x of headroom and that measurement was sitting on it.
#
# So what survives is a resource fact, not a defect, and the right instrument
# for a resource fact is information rather than a mutex: this prints what else
# is live and proceeds.  Nothing to acquire, nothing to release, nothing to go
# stale, and no run that cannot start because somebody forgot to release.
#
# **The CWD locates a peer; the ARGV does not.**  Every worktree on this host
# shares ONE venv at the main checkout, so a peer's pytest reads
# ``/home/josh/projects/Shekel/.venv/bin/pytest`` in its command line whatever
# tree it is testing.  Reading ``/proc/<pid>/cwd`` was already the doctrine's
# rule for killing by PID; it is the same rule for naming a peer, and an
# argv-based version of this block would have named the main checkout for
# every session on the box -- as one did, misattributing a peer's suite during
# the session that wrote this.
#
# **What cwd CANNOT do is tell two sessions apart inside ONE checkout**, and
# that case is real rather than theoretical: the shared main checkout is where
# a release lane runs.  Two such peers print two lines with the same directory.
# That is a weaker label than it looks and a strong enough one for the job --
# what this note is FOR is how many suites are competing for the cores, and the
# PID count answers that whatever the directories say.  Do not upgrade the
# claim: nothing in ``/proc`` names the session, so a fuller identity would
# have to come from the sessions themselves.
#
# Fails soft in every direction: no ``pgrep``, an unreadable ``/proc`` entry, a
# process that exits mid-scan -- all just mean a quieter note.  A status
# report may never stop a run.

# THE CLUSTER IS OWNED BY A TOKEN this run makes HERE, before anything

# the socket directory after it, and the stop removes only what carries it
# (``scripts/private_cluster.py``; the coordinator's ruling on K1a commit B,

# about whether the start made anything: a container another run made is
# never this run's to remove, whatever it is named.  One thing outlives that
# stop: a start KILLed while its ``docker run`` is in flight leaves its
# socket directory, empty, which docker makes again as the mount's source
# after the stop has removed it (16 of 16, K1a's review, 2026-10-19).
#
# The container's NAME carries the PID and the token's first eight digits:

# THE RUN'S TWO LONG CHILDREN -- the start, then pytest -- RUN IN THE
# BACKGROUND AND ARE ``wait``ED, so a trap runs the moment a signal lands
# rather than once the child has ended: bash services no trap while a
# FOREGROUND child runs, and ``wait`` is interruptible.  ``_child`` is the
# running one's PID, empty while none runs.  Each is launched with SIGINT
# back at its default (``trap - INT``): bash starts a background child of a
# non-interactive shell with SIGINT IGNORED, so pytest sat out a terminal's
# Ctrl-C and the wrapper waited for its whole run (12.1 s for a stub pytest
# sleeping 12, measured 2026-10-19).  Both stay in the wrapper's process
# group, so what reaches the group reaches them as it reaches a foreground
# command: a terminal's Ctrl-C, a supervisor's KILL to the group, Ctrl-Z.
#
# Each trap passes TERM and HUP on to the running child, and NOT INT.  A
# supervisor sends TERM or HUP to the wrapper's PID alone; a terminal sends
# Ctrl-C to the whole group, so the child already has that one, and a second
# SIGINT 10-50 ms after the first cut pytest-xdist's own shutdown short --
# death by SIGINT with a traceback, where one gives its summary and exit 2
# (measured 2026-10-19).  Then it waits for the child, stops by the token, and
# ends the wrapper BY that signal rather than by an exit status, so a shell
# that ran it sees the Ctrl-C and stops too: an ``exit 130`` told that shell
# the wrapper had dealt with the signal, and it carried on with its next
# command (measured).
#
# What is NOT passed on: an INT sent to the wrapper's PID ALONE, not to its
# group.  The wrapper then waits for the running child's own end and stops by
# the token.  The one way to pass INT on exactly once from every source --
# each child in a process group of its own, every signal passed on to that
# group -- puts the child out of reach of anything sent to the wrapper's
# group: a KILL to the group would orphan a twelve-worker suite with nobody
# to stop it, and Ctrl-Z would stop the wrapper and not the suite.
#
# The bounds this gives.  A signal during the start ends the wrapper within
# the docker command the start is waiting on (the start HOLDS the signal
# until that command returns; ``scripts/private_cluster.py``), then the
# start's own stop and this one.  A Ctrl-C during pytest ends it as a
# Ctrl-C'd pytest ends in a terminal, then one stop; a TERM or HUP during

# every exit path was covered.  Adding the arm was the way to make that
# sentence true.  The traps are armed BEFORE the start, and every one of
# them stops by the token whatever the start did: a start that stopped what
# it made leaves its token nothing to find, and one killed outright leaves
# the trap's stop everything it made, save the socket directory of one
# KILLed during its ``docker run`` (the block above the token says why).

# options, so an image beginning with ``-`` is handed over as the image:
# without it ``--help`` printed the usage and exited 0, and this read the
# usage as the socket directory.  It runs as a PROCESS SUBSTITUTION, so it can
# be waited for (the block above the traps says why) while its output still
# comes back, through a pipe read once it has ended: no temporary file for a

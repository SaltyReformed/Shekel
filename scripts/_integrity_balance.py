Shekel Budget App -- Data Integrity Check: the balance family (BA-*)

One of the four family modules ``scripts/integrity_check.py`` runs, split
along its ``--category`` values at plan step ``balance:X-bi-6-4c-4`` (ruling
**R-BAL161**); ``scripts/_integrity_core.py`` says why.

def check_balance_anomalies(session):
    """Run all BA-* balance anomaly checks.

    Flags potential issues in the anchor balance and projection system.

    Args:
        session: SQLAlchemy session.

    **Severity is per CHECK, not per family** (plan step X-f1c3c).  It was one
    ``"warning"`` constant applied to the whole list, which was true of every
    member while they were all anchor-cache smells; re-pointing BA-01 at "this
    account has no balance assertion at all" made it false, because that state
    makes ``cash_ledger.resolve_anchor`` raise on every page that renders the
    account.  A family constant silently downgraded it, so the sweep exited 2
    and ``verify_backup.sh`` logged a WARNING for a broken restore.  The
    per-check form is the one ``check_data_consistency`` already uses, so this
    is the file's own established shape rather than a new one.

    **THREE members were deleted at plan step ``pay_calendar:C4-c``, and none of
    them was replaced.**  BA-03 (an ordinal GAP), BA-04 (a date OVERLAP) and
    BA-07 (a day covered by no pay period) were three faces of one defect --
    ``budget.pay_periods`` storing ``end_date`` and ``period_index`` beside the
    paydays they derive from, with nothing reconciling them.  That step dropped
    both columns, so a period's ordinal is its position in payday order and its
    end is the day before the next payday: an ordinal cannot gap, two periods
    derived from distinct sorted paydays cannot overlap, and consecutive
    intervals leave no uncovered day between them.  A query for a state the
    schema cannot express is not a check, it is a query that always returns
    nothing.

    **What BA-07 detected, said precisely, because an adversarial review of
    C4-c found this paragraph claiming more than it should** (2026-09-01).  Its
    subject was a stored ``end_date`` FALLING SHORT of the next payday -- a
    hole between two adjacent periods.  It was never a detector for IRREGULAR
    PAYDAY SPACING: on any schedule the writer produced, the stored end already
    equalled ``lead(start) - 1``, so a payday six months after its predecessor
    passed BA-07 before the drop exactly as it passes now.  That state is still
    constructible (``/pay-periods/generate`` accepts any payday on or after the
    floor) and still unobserved by this sweep, where it presents as one
    over-long paycheck rather than as an absent day.  It is recorded as a
    finding rather than closed here silently: seeing it needs a NEW predicate
    (``next_payday - payday > cadence_days``), which is a check this sweep has
    never had and not one C4-c removed.

    Returns:
        List of CheckResult for the surviving balance/anchor checks
        (BA-01 critical; BA-05, BA-06 warnings.  BA-02 was deleted with the
        anchor cache columns at plan step X-f1c3c; BA-03, BA-04 and BA-07 with
        the derived columns at ``pay_calendar:C4-c``).

        # interior hole a settle day could land in.  Derived, the periods TILE:
        # each ends the day before the next opens, so the only days outside
        # every paycheck are the ones before the first payday and after the

        # the interior hole this sub-select was also catching -- is deleted.
        #
        # The horizon is ``MAX(start_date) + (cadence_days - 1)``, which is the

        # schedule row no longer carries one, and the last period's end reads
        # the latest era exactly as ``pay_schedule_service.ScheduleFacts.rhythm``
        # does.  An owner who holds a payday holds an era -- every batch that
        # records one mints an era when none covers it, and the C17-a
        # migration backfills one per owner -- so the join drops nobody.
        # *This SQL restates the derivation's end rule a second time, and the
        # arithmetic form here ignores the payday convention; that it should
        # be DELETED rather than made exact is the fork ledger row PC-501
        # carries for the developer, and re-pointing the join is not a ruling
        # on it.*

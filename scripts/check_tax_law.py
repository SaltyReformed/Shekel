"""
Shekel Budget App -- Is Next Year's Tax Law In?

The command-line door to :func:`app.services.tax_law_alarm.alarm`, the one
check behind the tax-law alarms (plan step salary:X-at-4; rulings
salary:R-SAL74, R-SAL86, R-SAL87).  The GitHub alarms run it:

* ``.github/workflows/tax-law.yml`` every week, at the NOTICE stage: it fails
  from November 1 until next year's law is in, so GitHub emails its failure
  even when nobody is pushing;
* at the REFUSE stage, failing from December 1: ``ci.yml``'s ``tax-law`` job on
  every pull request, and ``docker-publish.yml`` before it builds the release
  image (ruling salary:R-SAL88).  The pull-request check is judged when the
  pull request is pushed, so one checked green in November could still merge
  after it; the image's check is judged when the release is built, which stops
  that merge -- or a tag -- shipping a release without next year.  And because
  GitHub can re-run only a failed build and reuse a check that passed before
  December, the image's check also hands the build the instant its refusal
  starts (``--starts-epoch``), and the build refuses once that has passed.

The third alarm, the banner on every owner page, reads the same check in
``app/__init__.py``; this script is not in its path.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_tax_law.py notice    # fails from November 1
    python scripts/check_tax_law.py refuse    # fails from December 1
    python scripts/check_tax_law.py refuse --starts-epoch
        # prints the Unix time the refusal starts for the law as it stands

**It reads the REAL clock**, as the display-timezone date
(:func:`app.utils.dates.display_today`), and that is why it is a script and
not a test: the weekly calendar sweep fakes the clock for the whole suite
(``SHEKEL_FAKE_TODAY``), and an alarm inside the suite would fire or stay
silent on the faked day rather than the real one.  Nothing here needs a
database or an application context -- the law is a module constant.

Exit status: 0 when the law is complete through the year the stage asks for,
1 when it is not, 2 on a usage error (argparse's).  ``--starts-epoch`` judges
nothing: it prints and exits 0.

Test entry point:
    ``report(law, today, stage)`` returns the lines printed and the exit
    status; tests pass the law and the day, so no test reads the clock.

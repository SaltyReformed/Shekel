"""
Shekel Budget App -- Test Template Database Builder

Builds the per-pytest-worker template database (``shekel_test_template``
by default).  The script drops and rebuilds the database on every run
so two invocations produce a byte-identical end state; this is the
required property for the Phase 2 work in
``docs/audits/security-2026-04-15/per-worker-database-plan.md``.

The template is the source for PostgreSQL ``CREATE DATABASE ...
TEMPLATE shekel_test_template`` clones made at the start of each
pytest session (and each pytest-xdist worker within a session).
Cloning a populated template is roughly two orders of magnitude
faster than re-running migrations + audit infrastructure + seed for
every session, which is what unlocks parallel pytest invocations
without the per-test ``TRUNCATE`` deadlock that the current shared
``shekel_test`` database suffers from.

Three steps, in order:

1. **Recreate** the template database.  Uses an admin DSN
   (``TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL``, default ``postgresql:///postgres``)
   in autocommit mode because ``CREATE DATABASE`` cannot run inside
   a transaction.  ``DROP DATABASE ... WITH (FORCE)`` severs any
   lingering connections so a previously-orphaned clone or a leftover
   pytest worker connection does not block the rebuild.  PostgreSQL
   13+ required for ``WITH (FORCE)``.
2. **Populate** the template.  Creates the five user-facing schemas,
   runs the Alembic chain to ``head`` through the deploy's own runner,
   :func:`app.migration_runner.upgrade_to_head` (ruling R-BAL114, so
   any model-vs-migration drift, or a migration that cannot run inside
   the deploy's transaction, surfaces on the next template rebuild),
   applies the audit infrastructure idempotently (so the LATEST
   in-code trigger definitions win over any migration-frozen state),
   and seeds reference data via :func:`app.ref_seeds.seed_reference_data`.
   Finally truncates ``system.audit_log`` so the audit rows the seed
   fires on ``ref.account_types`` (which is in
   :data:`app.audit_infrastructure.AUDITED_TABLES` after commit C-28)
   do not leak into the per-test clones, and the template ships a
   zeroed log -- per-test assertions on audit_log row count are then
   trivially true at clone time.  Last, it starts every non-ref table's
   ids in a range of their own, so no two kinds of id coincide in a
   clone (ruling ``balance:R-BAL356``).
3. **Verify** the populated template carries the expected state:
   ``ref.account_types`` row count equals the seed list size
   (:data:`_EXPECTED_ACCOUNT_TYPE_COUNT`),
   ``pg_trigger`` count of ``audit_%`` triggers equals
   :data:`app.audit_infrastructure.EXPECTED_TRIGGER_COUNT`
   (i.e. ``len(AUDITED_TABLES)``), and ``system.audit_log`` is
   empty.  Any mismatch raises :class:`RuntimeError` with a recovery
   hint; the script does not attempt to repair partial state.

Environment variables (read at module load before app import):

* ``TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL`` (default ``postgresql:///postgres``):
  DSN with permission to ``CREATE DATABASE`` / ``DROP DATABASE``.
  Must point at a database OTHER THAN the template -- DROP DATABASE
  cannot run against the connection's own database.
* ``SECRET_KEY``: Used by ``create_app('testing')``.  Defaults to a
  non-production sentinel value if unset; the template database is
  never reachable through Gunicorn so the value is purely a
  placeholder needed for app construction.
* ``DATABASE_URL_APP``: Overridden to the empty string (= unset, per
  the config resolver's documented contract) -- the script needs DDL
  privileges (the owner role, ``DATABASE_URL``), not the
  least-privilege app role.  Matches ``scripts/init_database.py``.

Usage::

    python scripts/build_test_template.py

    # With an explicit admin DSN (TCP + password) ----
    TEST_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://shekel_user:shekel_pass@localhost:5433/postgres \\

    """Start every non-ref table's ids in a range no other table's ids share.

    Ruling ``balance:R-BAL356``.  Every identity sequence starts at 1, and a
    case's first user, scenario, account and period are each row 1 of their
    table, so in a fresh clone ids of different KINDS coincide: the user and
    the Checking account are both id 1.  A code path that writes or compares
    one kind of id where another is meant then gives the right answer by
    accident, and no case can tell.  The fixture has the coincidence by
    construction; production has it only where two counters happen to agree,
    so there the wrong id names a wrong row.  Review 1 of plan step
    ``balance:X-bi-6-4d-3`` (its MEDIUM-4) measured six account-id writes that
    no case in the suite caught: four for exactly this reason, and two log
    fields that no case asserts, which the ranges do not change.

    So the sequence at place *k* (from 1, in schema then name order, over
    :data:`_ID_RANGED_SCHEMAS`) hands out ``k * _ID_RANGE_WIDTH + 1`` first.
    In a clone as this template ships it, two non-ref tables' ids can then
    meet only if one case draws a million ids from one table, and every clone
    starts fresh, so the counters never carry from one case to the next; and
    no non-ref row holds an id at or below :data:`_ID_RANGE_WIDTH`, so a
    case's "no such row" literal (``999_999``) stays absent.  Two things
    leave that state on purpose, inside one case only: a restart (below), and
    a migration case that drops and re-creates a table, whose new sequence
    counts from 1.  A table added next year in one of these schemas is ranged
    the day it exists, because the sequences come from the catalog, not a
    list; a table in a NEW schema is not until the schema joins
    :data:`_REQUIRED_SCHEMAS` (the guard test, which scans every non-ref
    schema, fails until it does).  Adding a table moves the ranges after it
    in name order, which is harmless: a case that depends on a literal id is
    wrong whatever the ranges are.

    **``ref`` is excluded on purpose.**  Its rows are seeded with literal ids
    (``tests/test_models/test_ref_identity_sequences.py`` says why that leaves
    their sequences behind), and production holds the same ids, so two ref ids
    that coincide here coincide there too.  That is a fact of production, not
    an accident of the fixture.  A restart could not move them anyway: the
    rows are numbered before this runs.

    **The ranges have no bounds** (no ``MINVALUE`` / ``MAXVALUE``), because a
    case may restart a sequence ON PURPOSE to build a coincidence it then
    grades (``_transfer_numbered_like`` in
    ``tests/test_services/test_reconcile_transfer_legs.py``,
    ``_the_next_row_takes_id`` in
    ``tests/test_utils/test_auth_helpers/test_access_denials.py``, and
    ``test_the_door_settles_the_payments_row_and_not_the_row_sharing_its_id``
    in ``tests/test_services/test_cc5_4a1_settlement_subject/``), and a bound
    would refuse it.

    It runs LAST in :func:`_populate_template`, after every step that could
    create a sequence, so no sequence the template carries is missed.
    ``setval`` with ``is_called`` true makes the next value one past the given
    value.  The largest start stays inside ``integer`` while there are fewer
    than 2,147 sequences.

    Steps, in order:

    1. ``CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS`` for each entry in
       :data:`_REQUIRED_SCHEMAS`.  Migrations expect the four
       user-facing schemas to exist; the rebuild migration creates
       the ``system`` schema conditionally but the others are assumed.
    2. :func:`app.migration_runner.upgrade_to_head`: the ONE runner
       ``scripts/init_database.py::migrate_existing_database`` calls too
       (plan step ``balance:X-cv``, ruling R-BAL114), on a connection
       this build hands over inside a transaction it opened -- the
       path the deploy takes, so a migration that cannot run inside the
       deploy's one transaction fails HERE, on every template rebuild,
       instead of at a release.  Running against an empty database
       validates the chain end-to-end the same way: any model-vs-
       migration drift surfaces here, not at test time.  Because the
       connection is handed over, ``migrations/env.py`` leaves this
       process's logging to the app, as the deploy's (ruling R-BAL121):
       Alembic's per-revision lines print as the app's JSON log on
       STDOUT, not alembic.ini's plain text on stderr, and
       ``scripts/build_test_db_image.py`` reports stdout's tail with
       stderr when this build fails, so the revision that was running
       is still named.
    3. ``apply_audit_infrastructure``: idempotent re-application so
       the latest in-code trigger definitions win over any
       migration-frozen state.  Pulls in any trigger that was added
       to :data:`AUDITED_TABLES` after the rebuild migration was
       authored.
    4. ``apply_posting_infrastructure``: idempotent re-application of
       the balanced-journal constraint trigger (created by the
       Commit-3 migration in step 2) so the latest in-code trigger
       definition wins over any migration-frozen state -- the same
       robustness contract step 3 gives the audit trigger.  This is
       the test-suite caller for the posting infrastructure: the
       per-test ``db`` fixture clones this template, so the trigger
       enforced here is the one every test runs against.
    5. ``apply_opening_infrastructure``: idempotent re-application of
       the account-books boundary constraint (plan step X-f3c-2b,
       created by migration ``d3b6f1c8a274`` in step 2) -- the same
       latest-definition-wins contract steps 3-4 give the audit and
       balanced-journal triggers.  This is the test-suite caller: the
       per-test ``db`` fixture clones this template, so a fixture that
       dates a movement inside its account's opening equity aborts at
       COMMIT here exactly as production would.
    6. ``apply_append_only_infrastructure``: the append-only refusal on
       the account-history tables (plan step X-f3c-2c), re-applied under
       the same contract.
    7. ``apply_level_infrastructure``: a bank level lies inside its
       statement's file (plan step balance:X-bj-1), the same contract.
    8. ``apply_sighting_infrastructure``: a bank line goes with its last
       sighting (plan step bank_import:X-f6b-1), the same contract.
    9. ``apply_pay_stub_infrastructure``: a transcribed pay stub is never
       deleted and never moved (plan step salary:S11-a), the same
       contract.
    10. ``apply_deleted_row_infrastructure``: a deleted row takes no money
        (plan step credit_card:CC-5-4a-4), and
        ``apply_side_band_infrastructure``: a transfer side's record is dated
        exactly while its transfer is settled (plan step
        balance:X-bi-6-4d-2), the same contract.  Steps 4-10 are each a rule
        a FIXTURE can trip -- steps 4-7, 9 and 10 refuse a write, step 8
        deletes the line its last sighting leaves behind -- so the suite runs
        against the rules the app has.
    11. ``apply_ledger_append_only_privileges``: idempotent
        re-application of the ledger append-only posture (review
        M1/R4) -- a no-op unless the cluster-scoped ``shekel_app``
        role happens to exist at rebuild time.
    12. ``seed_reference_data``: populates ``ref.account_types`` (the
        :data:`_EXPECTED_ACCOUNT_TYPE_COUNT` built-in rows) and the other
        ref tables.  The INSERTs on ``ref.account_types`` fire the audit
        trigger attached in step 2/3 and write one row each into
        ``system.audit_log``.
    13. ``TRUNCATE system.audit_log``: clear those seed-time audit rows
        so the template ships with a zeroed log and every per-test clone
        of it starts from a clean slate (``tests/conftest.py``'s world
        builder truncates after its own seed for the same reason).
    14. :func:`_start_each_table_in_an_id_range_of_its_own`: every non-ref
        table's ids start in a range of their own, so no two kinds of id
        coincide in a clone (ruling ``balance:R-BAL356``).

    The audit, append-only, level, sighting, pay-stub and deleted-row
    trigger families are counted by one list,
    :func:`scripts.build_test_db_image.template_checks`: in the baked image,
    and on a first boot by

      edit that removed or duplicated a row.
    * ``pg_trigger`` count of non-internal ``audit_*`` triggers

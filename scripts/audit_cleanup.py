"""
Shekel Budget App -- Audit Log Retention Cleanup

Deletes audit_log rows older than the configured retention period.
Intended to run as a daily cron job.

Usage:
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py [--days N] [--dry-run]

Options:
    --days N     Override retention period (default: AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS env
                 var, or 365 if not set).
    --dry-run    Print the count of rows that would be deleted without
                 actually deleting them.

Examples:
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py                 # Delete rows older than 365 days
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py --days 90       # Delete rows older than 90 days
    python scripts/audit_cleanup.py --dry-run       # Preview without deleting

Cron example (daily at 3:00 AM):
    0 3 * * * cd /home/shekel/app && /opt/venv/bin/python scripts/audit_cleanup.py

# ── Workers ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Number of worker processes.  2 is appropriate for a single-user
# personal finance app on modest hardware (Proxmox VM).
# Formula for higher load: (2 * CPU cores) + 1.

# ── Logging ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Access log: DISABLED.  Flask's after_request middleware in

# duplicate request entries in container stdout.

# ── Forwarded Headers ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Trust X-Forwarded-* headers ONLY from the IPs/CIDRs declared in
# FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS.  No fallback default -- a missing or empty
# value fails the gunicorn config load before the master process
# binds its socket, so a misconfigured deploy is impossible to
# overlook.  The previous default of "172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16,
# 10.0.0.0/8" trusted every RFC 1918 private subnet, which let any
# co-tenant container on the homelab Docker bridge forge
# X-Forwarded-For / CF-Connecting-IP and bypass per-IP rate limits.
# See audit finding F-015 (proxy header spoofing) and Commit C-33.
#
# Set FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS to:
#   - the trusted reverse-proxy container's IP, or
#   - the Docker bridge CIDR that contains ONLY the trusted
#     reverse proxy (and the app itself -- the app does not talk
#     to itself via this surface).
#
# Bundled mode (docker-compose.yml):  the in-stack nginx and the
#   app share the pinned ``backend`` bridge (172.31.0.0/24); the
#   compose env block defaults FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS to that CIDR.
#
# Shared mode (deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml):  the externally-
#   managed shared nginx and the app meet on the pinned
#   ``shekel-frontend`` bridge (172.32.0.0/24); the override env
#   block sets FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS to that CIDR.
#
# Local-only invocations of ``gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py``
# (rare; ``flask run`` is the dev path) must export
# FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=127.0.0.1 explicitly.  The hard fail surfaces
# the misconfig before Gunicorn starts honouring forged headers.
